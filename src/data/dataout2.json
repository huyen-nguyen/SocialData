We forget that if interest rates were more normal, banks would be doing better,\" he said during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday from the Milken Institute's global conference. \"If the banks had the ability to be loaning out more money, especially the smaller and mid-sized banks: that creates jobs. That's what's been lacking over the last 10 years.\" Calamos' comments came amid a return to historical levels of volatility in equity markets after an unusually calm 2017. Despite extremely wide swings and days with 1,000-point Dow Jones industrial average losses, stock strategists have remained largely confident stocks will ultimately adjust to rising interest rates. That process has been turbulent thus far, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note topping 3 percent for the first time since 2014 last week and sparking a new round of uncertainty in the middle of earnings season. But, Calamos said, significant deregulation \u2013 a top priority of President Donald Trump's administration \u2013 could help ease the transition back to higher borrowing costs. Members of Congress are working to adjust aspects of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, which was passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis in an effort to tighten the behavior of a banking industry blamed for much of the economic instability. In March, the Senate voted to ease regulations on all but the largest banks, which would raise the level at which banks are considered \"systemically important\" and exempts smaller banks from other rules aiming to curb risky behavior. This deregulation \"is a tailwind for growth in the economy and I hope that continues. The worst economies in the world are going to be the ones that are over-regulated,\" Calamos said. Investors should see appreciation in financial and bank stocks, he explained, but other industries \u2013 like food and health care could see upside as well. Calamos, now in his seventies, took his mutual fund public in 2004 after decades of managing money outside the public sphere. His fund is often associated with growth equity as well as convertible bonds.

The private banking arm of OCBC, Singapore's second-largest lender by total assets, saw its assets under management in Dubai grow about 30 percent from its launch in the city's financial center last year, according to Reuters. \"I firmly believe and I'm very optimistic about the prospects of the region,\" Vikram Malhotra, Bank of Singapore's global market head for South Asia and the Middle East, told CNBC's Sri Jegarajah. The bank moved to its premises in Dubai International Financial Centre in 2016 and currently has more than one hundred employees based in the city. Private financial wealth in the Middle East and Africa is estimated to grow 8.1 percent by the end of 2021 to $12 trillion, according to a global wealth report from the Boston Consulting Group last year. That growth figure is only surpassed by the 9.9 percent increase projected for the Asia Pacific region. Malhotra also weighed in on competition for clients in the region, as well as a greater focus on regulation, amid greater focus on regulations. \"I think that's pretty much industry-specific. All the global banks are present in Dubai and are investing and growing in the region. Having said that, I think we have grown much faster than our competitors,\" he said. \"Of course, regulatory expectations are much higher today and everybody is investing in that regard as well,\" Malhotra said.

Both U.S. commodities and securities watchdogs are questioning whether the same rules for stocks should apply to these digital currencies, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Until now, cryptocurrencies have not been drawn into wider crackdowns by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. The cryptocurrency's creation in 2014 was \"probably an illegal securities sale\" in the eyes of some regulators, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. show chapters Here's what sets ethereum apart from its rival bitcoin 8:10 AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 | 02:21 Ether, which has a roughly $65 billion market cap, fell about 6 percent Tuesday, and was trading near $652, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. The analysis is based on whether founders of virtual currencies other than bitcoin have any control over their value, similar to how a company's managers might influence a company's stock value based on strategy and investments, the Journal said. Two federal regulatory agencies have applied different definitions to what exactly a cryptocurrency is. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has labeled them as commodities, meaning they're exempt from SEC regulation. The SEC on the other hand, has indicated that it sees cryptocurrencies as securities. In March, the agency said it is looking to apply securities laws to everything from cryptocurrency exchanges to digital asset storage companies known as wallets. Senior SEC and CFTC officials are among those scheduled to discuss the matter on Monday, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The Ethereum foundation raised more than 31,000 bitcoin in July 2014, worth about $18.3 million at the time, when it first sold the first 60 million ether. Because investors were speculating that the launch would result in a rise in asset value, the deal resembled a security, the Journal said. Ethereum is the name of the company that created the digital token ether. The company created a platform for applications built on blockchain, the same technology that underpins bitcoin. Ether was first launched as a fundraising effort to develop the platform. A consortium called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which includes companies like Microsoft and J.P. Morgan, is developing uses for the Ethereum blockchain.

Musk dismissed a question from Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, about gross margins, calling it \"boring.\" The stock's decline and Musk's comments took place after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the previous quarter. Here's a wrap of all the major analyst opinions going out to Wall Street pros regarding Tesla on Thursday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (Underperform): \"Key takeaways were as follows: 1) Revenue of $3.41bn was a bit ahead of our $3.29bn estimate, as lighter deliveries (relative to BofAML estimates) were offset by a greater proportion of vehicles sold with immediate revenue recognition; 2) Reported total company gross margin of 13.4% was lower than our 17.4% estimate, as Automotive was roughly in line and other segments relatively weak, although Auto gross margin of 19.7% was down roughly 800bps+ YoY due primarily to the slow Model 3 ramp; and 3) Operating expenses (SG&A, R&D) of $1.05bn were just above our $1.02bn forecast, up both YoY and sequentially.\" Bernstein (Hold): \"Tesla's Q1 earnings call was a unique experience, to say the least. For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were 'boring' and 'not cool,' and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla's Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\" Morgan Stanley (Hold): \"To be clear. Tonight's conference call didn't go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO's annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla's success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\" J.P. Morgan (Sell): \"Tesla reported mixed 1Q results after the close yesterday, marked by better than expected revenue, margin, & EPS but accompanied by a bigger than expected cash outflow and record net loss. Given that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as 'dry' and 'boring' (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company's capital requirements).\" Goldman Sachs (Sell): \"Altogether, we believe the update had more negative undertones than positive implications and believe shares should see pressure as a result. Ultimately, the path for shares over the next two months likely tracks available VIN registration data \u2013 which has helped point to weekly production cadence of the Model 3.\" Barclays (Sell): \"We expected the shareholder letter to be more about the future than about the quarter in the books that was plagued by a slow ramp of the M3. And in that we were right \u2013 the letter is replete with optimistic predictions of achieving positive profits in 2H, based on the assumption that it can get to a 5000/wk run rate (which we note is likely a steady 5k/week, not a burst rate). But at the same time, while still a large loss and cash burn, the quarter was less bad than we thought \u2013 with a modest amount of opex discipline, lower than expected capex (and a lower capex guide for the year) \u2013 which contributed to somewhat better cash burn (a mere $1.1bn instead of our more dire $1.9bn) and EPS.\" Guggenheim (Buy): \"As Tesla keeps grinding through its ramp of the Model 3, it continues to target production hitting 5K units/week entering Q3E, which we continue to forecast dramatically flipping the company's economics from sizeable cash-burn in 1H18E to profitability in 2H18E, with Model 3 volumes then driving meaningful positive leverage in 2019-20E off the big fixed-cost structure it has been building.\" Piper Jaffray (Buy): \"Management strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations. But then Elon Musk began dismissing analysts' questions and decided instead to field TWELVE questions from a YouTuber because it was 'way more interesting.' The unorthodox behavior sparked an after-hours sell-off. We still recommend TSLA, but in the next few months especially, we would expect significant volatility.\" Baird (Buy): \"Ignore the noise and focus on metrics. TSLA reported solid results and is successfully ramping Model 3 vehicle and battery production, although Elon refused to answer several questions on the conference call which he deemed mundane, which may create pressure on the stock. That said, we believe investors should continue to focus on TSLA's progress and recommend buying shares.\" Nomura (Buy): \"We are disappointed by the way last night's earnings call went. No shareholder wants to see a CEO lose his patience over important, albeit mundane questions about margins, capex and customer deposits. It will most likely divert attention today away from several positive fundamentals from the Q1 report and outlook.\" RBC Capital Markets (Hold): \"An odd conference call that lacked answers to questions on investors' minds and overshadowed earnings. Investor feedback is that the performance shook confidence, which we'd argue is an important piece of the Tesla story. The results themselves probably did little to incrementally persuade bulls/bears either way. There is still healthy, and warranted, skepticism about Tesla's near-term production capabilities.\" Evercore ISI (Hold): \"'Wow' is the only way to describe the Tesla Q1 call which was unlike anything we have heard before. The call yielded little of incremental value to investors in our view. However, it did witness CEO Musk somewhat curtly dismiss questions from two well respected peers in favour of a plethora of questions from a retail investor. Were the retail investor's questions basic or boring? No. However, they did not address the more granular aspects of Tesla's Q1 performance and Q2 expectations which the analyst community was attempting to address. Questions which we believe need to be answered in order for the broader investment community to become more constructive on a name that continues to burn cash and whose funding needs remain subject to debate.\" Oppenheimer (Hold): \"We expect many investors to focus on questions around strategic leadership as CEO Elon Musk hung up on analysts asking questions related to battery production runrate and what he deemed boring questions about financial and operational metrics.

Check out the companies making headlines after the bell: Spotify shares plunged as much as 10 percent in the extended session. The entertainment company reported revenues and monthly active users that fell in line with estimates, but its guidance for the upcoming quarter was weak and it is still losing money. This quarter's earnings are the first the newly public company has reported. Square stock sank more than 6 percent post-market. The financial services and mobile payment company's earnings fell in line with what was expected and its revenues were better than expected. Its gross payment volume also fell in line with expectations. Weak earnings guidance disappointed investors. Tesla shares rose as much as 2 percent in extended trading after posting better than expected earnings, but the company's stock later gave up its gains. The electric vehicle maker and energy storage company's loss per share was smaller than expected and its revenue surpassed estimates. Its cash burn was also smaller than analysts expected. It also expects to be profitable and cash-flow positive in the second half of the year. The company previously stated that it wants to ramp up Model 3 production to 6,000 per week by the end of June. So far it is up to producing 2,020 by the end of the first quarter, still short of its growth goal. Shares of AIG fell nearly 6 percent after the bell. The finance and insurance corporation reported a substantial miss on earnings per share. Sprint stock gained nearly 2 percent in the extended session. The mobile carrier beat estimates on revenues and earnings but its net adds were lower than expected. It also announced that current CFO Michel Combes will become the company's CEO and current CEO Marcelo Claure will become Sprint's executive chairman. Claure will also fill the roles of COO at Softbank Group and CEO at Softbank Group International. The personnel changes come as Sprint plans to merge with T-Mobile. If the deal is approved, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere will remain CEO of the newly merged carrier. Express Scripts stock dropped more than 1 percent in the extended session before recovering its losses. The prescription management company beat estimates on earnings but missed on revenues. Its full-year earnings guidance was also lowered. Fitbit shares sank more than 4 percent post-market. The wearable technology maker reported a beat on revenues and a smaller loss than expected, but guidance for the upcoming quarter was weak on top and bottom lines. Shares of Zynga rose more than 2 percent in post-market trading after the company announced a new share structure. The gaming company said on Wednesday that it would move to a single class structure, reducing the voting power of chairman and co-founder Mark Pincus. It also reported a higher mobile audience and revenue of $208.2 billion. Kraft Heinz stock rose more than 3 percent in extended trading after reporting mixed earnings. The grocery manufacturer just missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings per share. The beat comes despite lower first-quarter sales.

The company significantly missed revenue estimates in its latest report and said its next quarter year-over-year revenue growth rate will \"decelerate substantially,\" partially due to ad prices. The company also missed analysts target for daily active users and revenue per user. As a result, multiple firms published bearish notes and knocked down their price targets for Snap's stock. Morgan Stanley dropped its price target to $8, about $6 below where the stock closed Tuesday, and remains underweight. Snap was trading at $11.45 on Wednesday morning, down nearly 19 percent on the day. \"1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a note to clients Wednesday.

Nowak cited user churn, the bungled app redesign, poor performance on Androids and advertiser concerns as headwinds expected to continue into the second quarter. Analysts at Piper Jaffray were \"skeptical\" after the results, projecting an $11.50 price target. It cited leadership and said competition from Instagram could add to the pain. \"Snap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp said in a note to clients. \"We think the negative news cycle around Snap will continue and advertisers will likely continue to approach Snap skeptically.\" Analysts at Deutsche Bank were also bearish, keeping a $12 price target with a hold rating. \"Snapchat risks losing its 'cool' status with users frustrated by the redesign, which makes advertisers increasingly unlikely to put money into Snap advertising without clear ROI returns,\" Deutsche Bank's Lloyd Walmsley said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"We think Snap is a 'show me' stories to advertisers (and investors), and has to move fast to change the narrative, particularly given its cash burn levels,\" Walmsley said. Credit Suisse dropped its price target from $21 to $16, still above where the stock was trading Wednesday. While its analysts called the quarter \"conviction-testing,\" they maintained their outperform rating. \"As shares have already retraced back almost all of the gains, we elect to maintain our Outperform rating for now given the upside potential but acknowledge that further patience may be required,\" Deutsche Bank's Stephen Ju said.

But \"the longer the expansion has been, the more likely the sell-off will be hard.\" The U.S. economy is on its second-longest expansion on record, growing for 106-straight months. However, U.S. stocks have been under pressure in 2018. Year to date, the S&P 500 is down nearly 1 percent after reaching an all-time high on Jan. 26. Minerd also reiterated his call for a 40 to 45 percent drop in stocks starting in late 2019 and into 2020 as the U.S. economy enters a recession. He previously made his prediction last month during another interview with CNBC. \"Recessions occur when the economy reaches constraints.

Technology stocks, rather than industrial heavyweights, drove much of the surge in capital investment in the first quarter, preliminary data show. Capital expenditures are on track to post 25.9 percent growth for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as of Tuesday morning. Much of that comes from 59.8 percent projected growth in investments from information technology companies. \"Internet and Software are pushing Tech capex to 5-year highs,\" Credit Suisse's Jonathan Golub and his team said in a Monday report that looked at the 55 percent of S&P 500 quarterly reports. They said Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft accounted for much of the increase, along with spending related to cloud computing and semiconductors. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); President Donald Trump and Republicans slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent late last year. But so far, the extra capital appears to have gone more into dividends and share buybacks than capital investments that typically spur economic growth. Few companies have discussed increases in capital expenditures due to tax reform, according to CNBC analysis of the latest earnings calls using financial search engine AlphaSense. In addition, the industries whose spending is most directly tied to that growth are not investing. Industrials are tracking for a 3.3 percent drop in capital investment for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding tech, growth in S&P 500 capital expenditures would slow to 19.5 percent from 25.9 percent for the quarter. Consumer discretionary is second to tech in capex growth, and much of that is coming from e-commerce giant Amazon.com, cruise operator Royal Caribbean and General Motors, according to Credit Suisse. The report pointed out that Royal Caribbean's $1.7 billion pickup \"results from several new ships.\" Technology also accounts for the most capital expenditure growth among smaller companies. S&P 400 tech companies posted 48 percent growth in first-quarter capex as of Tuesday, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"We're not hearing a lot of evidence yet of increased CapEx tied to tax reform,\" John J. Engel, CEO of electrical equipment distribution company Wesco International, said during an earnings call last week. However, \"we actually think that's still a future upside as we move through 2018 and into 2019,\" Engel said, according to a Thomson Reuters transcript from AlphaSense. \"We've heard the beginnings of that with respect to some of the tech companies, citing that as a reason for stepping up their project activity or capital.\" Analysts are less optimistic for the near term. Tech capital expenditures are projected to slow for the rest of the year to just 11.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Growth in overall S&P 500 capital investments is also expected to drop off, and ultimately post a 2.5 percent decline in the fourth quarter.

The issue over privacy came to the forefront after the research firm Cambridge Analytica was recently accused of improperly accessing the personal user data of as many as 87 million Facebook users. Hughes said it is now a question of what Facebook and others will do next, and whether that should include government intervention. \"It's not just enough to trust the corporations. I think that there's a role for public policy as well,\" he told Brian Sullivan on \"Closing Bell\" from the Milken Institute Global Conference. He believes public pressure should be kept up on companies to make sure data are secure. At the same time, there should be something like a data privacy bill of rights or some type of \"consumer data protection bureau that makes sure that there's the rule of law when it comes to these questions,\" he said. Hughes, a Harvard dormmate of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, was the early spokesperson for the social network. He also worked on the products team. Hughes left Silicon Valley to help organize the online efforts for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. \"There is a sense all of these companies have gotten very big very fast. Perhaps too big,\" said Hughes, now co-chair of The Economic Security Project. During his congressional testimony in April, Zuckerberg acknowledged it is \"inevitable\" there will need to be some regulation of social media. \"I also think you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place,\" the CEO said. Hughes said while companies can and should innovate, they should also make sure that data is protected and that \"people can share in the upside,\" he said. \"A small group of companies is creating historic level of profits\" from that consumer data, he said. He thinks they can put about 5 percent into a sovereign wealth fund and then cut a dividend check.

The Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist believes Wall Street is making a mistake by not embracing an unprecedented first-quarter earnings season. \"It's really strange. We're seeing the best earnings season maybe ever. Twenty-five percent year-over-year growth in the ninth year of a recovery, and companies are beating by 8 percent,\" Golub said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"But the market's response to this is far more muted than normal.\" His thoughts came shortly after the Federal Reserve made its latest decision on interest rates, leaving them unchanged, but noted it detected inflation. \"I'm generally a believer that we overemphasize the importance of the Fed as opposed to the economic backdrop and the earnings backdrop,\" said Golub. The market didn't welcome the Fed's assessment. Stocks finished the Wednesday in the red. The Dow has now dropped more than 10 percent below its Jan. 26 intraday all-time high of 26,616.71. The S&P 500 is now 8 percent below its intraday record high of 2,872.87 from that same date. Despite the leg down, Golub expects a comeback. He predicts the S&P 500 will rally about 13 percent to 3,000 by year-end. \"This ultimately powers through. Take a look at stocks.

Next week, activist shareholders will make their first attempt at shaking up the gun industry using their votes instead of just their voices. One big campaign is against an NRA-connected director on the board of Sturm Ruger & Co., one of the nation's largest gun makers. Groups are threatening to withhold their votes for Sandra Froman's renomination as director to the board, where she has been a member since 2015. Froman has been a director of the National Rifle Association for 26 years and was its president from 2005 to 2007. Amalgamated Bank, which describes itself as promoting socially responsible causes, wants Sturm Ruger to agree to a list of demands involving gun safety and sales practices by this Friday or it says it will withhold its vote for Froman. The company, it says, is too closely tied to the NRA. show chapters Who makes the AR-15 rifle? 7:01 PM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 02:19 The relationship between Sturm and the NRA \"may inhibit the ability of your company's Board to accurately evaluate the risks the company faces,\" Amalgamated's CEO, Keith Mestrich, wrote in a letter to the company last month. \"The NRA plays a key role in shaping the gun industry's response to calls for gun control measures, opposing even incremental changes and common sense reforms supported by a majority of gun owners.\" Sturm Ruger's meeting comes just days after the NRA holds its annual meeting this weekend in Dallas, where Vice President Mike Pence is among the scheduled speakers. A Sturm Ruger spokesman didn't return a call for comment. And a request to Froman for comment, made by way of an NRA spokesman, also wasn't returned. Another community group, Majority Action, is organizing retail investors to push big fund companies like BlackRock and Vanguard, Sturm Ruger's biggest shareholders, to assert their voting power. The group organized about six weeks ago, seeing now as a crucial moment for changing the gun industry. \"We were looking at how you enable everyday investors to access the levers of power when it comes to holding companies accountable,\" said James Rucker, its co-founder, who is on the board of directors of the Southern Poverty Law Center. But even before these recent demands, controversy was certain to erupt at Sturm Ruger's meeting, scheduled to take place May 9 at a resort in Arizona thousands of miles from its Connecticut headquarters. The company has a factory in the area. Wednesday's vote will be the first test this year of a proposal by a faith-based shareholder group urging the nation's gun industry to act after recent extreme examples of gun violence. Specifically, that proposal, backed by the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, asks gun makers like Sturm Ruger to prepare a report about the financial and reputational risks associated with their business. The coalition plans to introduce a similar proposal on the proxy of American Outdoor Brands, which typically holds its meetings in the fall. Two major shareholder voting advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have thrown their support behind the coalition's proposal, Sturm Ruger's board, on the other hand, is advising shareholders to vote against it. \"We believe that firearms safety is a laudable and appropriate goal,\" it said in the proxy. \"However, we also believe that adequate safety practices and procedures are available.\" BlackRock said in a note to clients in March that it is time to take action on gun violence, adding it could use its position as a large shareholder to vote against boards and management and back shareholder proposals management doesn't like. But it won't comment about how it plans to vote its 2.8 million shares next week. Several companies connected to the gun industry have changed their policies in recent weeks in response to the upswell of protests after a shooting in a Florida high school in February left 17 people dead. Major retailers such as Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods put limits on gun sales, and banks like Citigroup said it would restrict gun sales by business partners. Fund managers like BlackRock and State Street said they would start a dialogue with gun makers about what they are doing to promote safety. BlackRock has even rolled out new funds that specifically remove stocks of gun makers and sellers. Amalgamated wants the gun maker to publicly endorse universal background checks, funding for government to to crack down on illegal distribution, and funding for government research into gun safety and public health. They also want a commitment to responsible distribution contracts, monitoring of distribution chains and investments in gun safety technology and commercialization. Froman, 68, is a lawyer and long-time gun industry supporter. The Southern Poverty Law Center found her name in a 2014 member directory of a secretive ultra-conservative group called the Council for National Policy. Tax forms from 2015 and 2016 filed by that organization list her as treasurer. The year she became president of the NRA, the gun lobby won a crucial legal battle in the form of a new law limiting liability claims against gun makers. That same year, a donor program for the NRA launched and, as reported by Bloomberg in 2012, took in nearly $15 million from gun-related companies. Froman has pointed to Smith & Wesson's decision in 2000 to voluntarily comply with certain gun safety measures as its downfall. Grassroots gun supporters forced the company into bankruptcy after it made that \"deal with the devil,\" she has said. \"The grass roots is a powerful force that the government can't control and can't fight,\" she said in a speech in 2011 to a group that supports knife ownership. \"Just look at what's happened with the rise of the Tea Party movement. Most of the battles that NRA has won have been won by sheer political power.\" The NRA is said to be the subject of fresh scrutiny about its ties to a Russian government official recently sanctioned by the U.S. That official, Alexander Torshin, is a lifetime NRA member, CNN reported Friday. One of Torshin's former aides, Maria Butina, the founder of the Russian group \"Right to Bear Arms,\" was hosted by Froman as part of the annual NRA Women's Leadership luncheon in 2014. Butina posted a photo of the two on her blog back then, calling Froman a \"legendary woman.\" Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun safety group that began as an organization founded by former New York major Michael Bloomberg, also details the NRA's connections to Russians, including Torshin and Butina, on its website. The proxy advisory services have advised shareholders to vote in favor of all the of the directors nominated to Sturm Ruger's board, including Froman. ISS did note that Sturm Ruger has a contract with the NRA for some of its promotional and advertising activities and paid the group $800,000 last year.

| Bloomberg | Getty Images Deepak Ahuja, Tesla CFO (left) and Elon Musk, Tesla founder and CEO (right), at the Nasdaq opening bell ceremony for the Tesla initial public offering on Tuesday, June 29, 2010. For five quarters in a row ahead of Wednesday earnings, free cash flow has been negative at Tesla, and the electric-car maker has been burning through more than $6,500 every minute, according to data compiled by Bloomberg this week. What's more, executives, including on the financial department, are coming and going. Yet this isn't the first time Tesla has had to survive some pretty harsh financial woes. And no one knows that better than Deepak Ahuja. The CFO joined Tesla in July 2008. Two months later the global economy crashed. Challenged with managing Tesla's balance sheet through the 2008 crisis, Ahuja saw Tesla through its hugely successful IPO just two years later. Shares of the company continued on their upward trajectory, and in 2015 Ahuja retired somewhat of a hero. Now he's back to reclaim his hero status as a cash-manager, having retaken the CFO post in February 2017 after Jason Wheeler left the company. Ahuja's task will be difficult, and there probably will be speed bumps. Tesla continues to burn through cash at an alarming rate and could run out of money before year-end, according to the most bearish analyst reports. Last year the company raised more than $1 billion in equity and later offered almost $2 billion in a junk-debt issue. In late March, Moody's downgraded Tesla credit and changed the outlook to \"negative\" from \"stable.\" In its Wednesday earnings report for the first quarter, even though cash flow remained negative, Tesla reported a slower cash burn rate and losses that were narrower than expected. Revenue rose to $3.41 billion, outpacing analysts estimates of $3.22 billion, but it continues to spend heavily to meet production goals. Tesla ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion, down from $3.4 billion the previous time it reported. show chapters Elon Musk's big ambitions may be killing Tesla 3:45 PM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 04:54 Shares of the electric-car maker are down roughly 4 percent this year after boasting a near-47 percent gain in 2017. Recently, the stock has come under pressure amid investor conflict if whether Tesla's technological advances are enough to offset production setbacks. Short interest, including some high-profile hedge fund bets against Tesla, reached 30 percent of publicly available shares recently. Tesla shares hit an all-time high of $389 in September but are down about 25 percent from that high. Trading near-$300 is still a 17 times gain from its IPO price of $17 in 2010. \"There are many, many existential threats that come along on a daily, weekly or quarterly basis; they are always there,\" Ahuja said when speaking last year at the Indian Institutes of Technology where he studied as an undergraduate. He does not expect the high-stakes, high-risk aspect of the Tesla business model to change. The hurdles Tesla faces today are similar as when Ahuja served his first term as CFO, as he explained last year: The technology doesn't work the way the company expected. It may still be the right product, but it's not ready. Or the time to get the product to market is longer than initially thought. \"There are many, many existential threats that come along on a daily, weekly or quarterly basis; they are always there.\" -Deepak Ahuja, Tesla CFO Recalling earlier Tesla production issues, he said, \"To compound it we had this super-aggressive production ramp we thought would go from zero to 400 cars a week, in six months, and we could barely touch 200,\" he said during his talk in India last year. \"Dealing with that becomes an existential crisis because the revenue is not coming and costs are piling up. Those challenges don't stop, and I don't think they are over for Tesla. There's still a big path ahead of us.\" There's now more pressure on the finance team to oversee more stringent spending, with Musk citing questionable company expenditures in a recently leaked email to employees: \"A fair criticism leveled at Tesla by outside critics is that you're not a real company unless you generate a profit, meaning simply that revenue exceeds costs. ... Going forward, we will be far more rigorous about expenditures. I have asked the Tesla finance team to comb through every expense worldwide, no matter how small, and cut everything that doesn't have a strong value justification. All capital or other expenditures above a million dollars, or where a set of related expenses may accumulate to a million dollars over the next 12 months, should be considered on hold until explicitly approved by me.\" Driving back to the future When the global economy tanked in 2008, things got so bad at Tesla, so fast, Ahuja couldn't face telling his family. Tesla was closing on a $100 million series E round \"which completely fell apart,\" Ahuja noted last year in India, \"and it meant we had to completely redesign our business plan,\" he said. He spared no one when it came to considering cuts. Tesla laid off 30 percent of its workers. \"I thought maybe I'll be let go. It made sense. Why have a high-paid CFO when you don't need it?\" \"Those were the dark, dark days \u2014 the nuclear winter, so to say,\" Ahuja recalled last year. \"We went through a period where we felt like payroll won't be met next week.\" The only money coming in was Elon Musk's personal investment in the company. After having moved his family across the country from a stable job at Ford to Tesla, the executive faced a stark reality: \"I was prepared to move in a week if Tesla blew up, and it could have happened, I am sure,\" he said. \"Somehow we survived that.\" Today CFRA's Levy thinks the fears of imminent bankruptcy in Tesla's case are overstated. \"I think it doesn't matter a whole lot what they announce this quarter. Most of the bulls and bears will dig in,\" he said. \"To me the catalyst is to start meeting objectives.\" Levy believes they are closer to the date where they can start turning things around on a sustainable level, generating cash flow and making a profit. \"But the longer it takes for them to make the Model 3 viable, the greater the risk.\" Alexis Georgeson | Harvest Films The first deliveries of the Tesla Model 3 on July 29, 2017. \"It's just one quarter; this is a multiyear story,\" said David Whiston, auto equity Morningstar analyst who has a fair value of $235 on the stock. \"I am more optimistic than some, but very cognizant of all the risks. With all the hype, not enough attention has been paid to balance-sheet risk. Elon is the company in a sense. To investors.\" \"They say a lot of things, but ultimately they have to deliver,\" he added. \"[Musk] can talk about 5,000 or 6,000 cars. ... I don't care, just make them.\" Tesla last announced in early April that it was making over 2,000 Model 3s a week, and planned to reach 5,000 per week in the second quarter. In the last week of April, it hit 2,270 Model 3s, Tesla announced in its quarterly report on Wednesday. \"Earnings is what it is,\" Whiston said. \"Pretty much the same thing every quarter, and it isn't so much one quarter that matters. ... Even if later in the year Elon's projections turn out to be true, they are not done with the portfolio, the semi truck and Model Y, and all that takes a lot of money.\" Musk takes on 'boring' Wall Street analysts In its first quarter earnings report, Tesla said it spent over $1 billion in the quarter, but expects total capex will decrease from roughly $3.4 billion to roughly $3 billion. It is expecting positive cash flow, and net income, in both the third and fourth quarters of this year. Musk and Ahuja wrote in the quarterly letter to investors that the capex decrease would be driven by \"focusing on the critical near-term needs that benefit us primarily in the next couple of years.\" The company said it has a plan to \"significantly cut back\" the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment. CFRA's Levy noted that profitable quarters in the past have been achieved by Tesla, but have not been sustained, though they have preceded an additional capital raise. That's a cash-raising move that analysts believe would lessen the tail risk. After its stock reached an all-time high late last year, near $390, some analysts had expected Tesla to take advantage of the timing to issue more equity. Some still think it's the right move. \"Right now, it's prudent for them to do a capital raise, an equity raise,\" Levy said. Musk said again on Wednesday's call that the company had no need to raise capital. But as Tesla's cash issues linger, and analysts press for more details, Musk seems to have lost patience with the quarterly Wall Street game. During the earnings call, Musk criticized investors' focus on short-term volatility, advised investors who don't understand the long-term view to sell the stock, and slammed day traders, as well as the media. He took questions via Youtube from an individual Tesla investor, and referred to analyst questions as being \"so dry,\" and a question on gross margins from a Bernstein analyst, specifically, as \"boring\" and \"bonehead.\" Tesla shares, which initially had moved higher in post-earnings, after-hours trading, shed as much as $2 billion in value as the call progressed.

If the economy is going be crippled just because a terrorist group is in access of one or two hundred missiles, that is a serious problem,\" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh. \"All our reforms have been done while terrorist activities are taking place on our border, trying to impact our economy, and we are saying no \u2014 we are going to defend our territory, but that will not distract us from pushing social, legal and financial reforms.\" The minister was referring to the broad set of economic reforms underway in the kingdom, most notably \"Vision 2030,\" a large-scale initiative aimed at expanding the private sector and diversifying the country's oil-dependent economy away from hydrocarbons. Oil currently accounts for roughly 87 percent of Saudi budget revenues and 90 percent of export earnings. Khaled Abdullah | Reuters Shi'ite Muslim rebels hold up their weapons during a rally against air strikes in Sanaa March 26, 2015. Regional observers have questioned the viability of such a reform agenda amid fluctuating oil prices and geopolitical conflicts like Saudi Arabia's military involvement in the Yemeni civil war and its escalating tensions with regional arch-rival Iran. 'Economy was not impacted at all' Earlier this month, Saudi's southern city of Jizan was the target of missile fire by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which it says was successfully intercepted. The mid-April strike followed a missile attack in March that was the Yemeni rebels' largest cross-border offensive in its three-year war thus far, sending seven long-range rockets toward Riyadh. show chapters Saudi Arabia finance minister: There's a lot of excitement about reforms 5:23 AM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 01:32 \"We've received in the last two years or so about 100-plus missiles, all have been intercepted successfully, and our economy was not impacted at all,\" Al-Jadaan said. \"It is important to note that this region has been through a lot of waves of geopolitical tensions ... Our economies have weathered this without really any significant impact,\" he added. \"Reactions from leaders across the world have been very supportive of Saudi Arabia's position, so I'm very comfortable with the geopolitical situation.\" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects Saudi growth at 1.8 percent for 2018 after suffering its first contraction last year since 2009. Oil prices, seeing multi-year highs, are expected to boost the economy. But the kingdom would need oil to hit averages of $85 to $87 a barrel to balance its budget, the IMF said. Its current deficit is projected at 7.3 of GDP for 2018, and it aims to balance the budget by 2030. Missile strikes and Yemen The Saudi government says Houthi rebels have fired at least 116 missiles at the kingdom since it went to war in Yemen in 2015, and claims that all have been intercepted. The missile launches were in response to Saudi Arabia's airstrikes on the impoverished country, which began in 2015 when the Houthis, a minority Shia sect, gained control of much of eastern Yemen and territory along the Saudi border after overthrowing its President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi in late 2014. Saudi claims its involvement is in support of the president, who it seeks to put back in power. The Houthis are being bolstered by Shia ally Iran in the form of advanced weaponry and military advisors. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has accused the Islamic Republic of \"direct military aggression,\" ramping up the stakes between the longtime adversaries. Iran denies it supplied missiles to Yemen. Last March marked the third year of Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen's bloody civil war, where its aerial bombing campaign has been widely criticized as indiscriminate and in violation of international law. The protracted conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced 3 million, according to the UN.

Shares of Caterpillar fell Thursday after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the company's stock to neutral from overweight, arguing that sales growth is slowing after a strong 2017. \"Caterpillar's monthly retail sales growth is beginning to slow, and appears to be past its peak,\" analyst Ross Gilardi said in a note Thursday. \"Caterpillar saw across-the-board deceleration in all of its key regions, particularly in construction ... comparatives become much more difficult in the next six months, as worldwide machinery sales were down 8 percent in January 2017.\" Shares of Caterpillar fell 1 percent following the analyst's call. Its stock is up 41 percent over the past year, well ahead of the Dow Jones industrial average's 14 percent climb during the period. It is the second-best performer in the index over the last 12 months. The blue-chip company easily surpassed quarterly financial expectations last week, posting earnings per share of $2.82 against projections of $2.13. In the earnings report, the Illinois-based machinery manufacturer raised its 2018 profit outlook by $2 a share over the previous quarter, to a range of $10.25 to $11.25 per share. Caterpillar's stock fell shortly after executives noted that the first-quarter earnings would be the \"high-water mark\" for 2018. Despite the strong earnings, Gilardi also cut his price target on the equipment manufacturer to $156 a share from $172, implying just above 8 percent upside over the next 12 months. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Third Point said it took a \"significant stake\" in United Technologies in the fourth quarter. That position is likely about $1 billion in size, CNBC's David Faber reported. Shares of the industrial conglomerate rose more than 1 percent in late morning trading Friday. The stock, which has a market capitalization of about $95.2 billion, is down more than 6 percent for the year so far. \"While UTC disagrees with several of the assertions contained in the Third Point letter, the company is always open to the input of shareholders,\" the company said in a release Friday. The Connecticut-based firm added it will complete a previously announced portfolio review this year. United Technologies has \"strong franchise assets with leading market share within each segment but the Company's shares have lagged its industrial peers (XLI Index) by approximately 45% over the last five years,\" Third Point said. But the company has a \"well-documented history of poor management execution \u2014 exemplified most recently by the botched ramp-up of the next-generation geared turbofan (\"GTF\") engine \u2014 as well as market share losses and underinvestment in key business areas,\" the letter said. The hedge fund said it has initiated conversations with United Technologies' board and that CEO Greg Hayes has indicated the board is reviewing the company's portfolio. Also in Friday's letter, Third Point disclosed its offshore fund performed slightly better than the S&P 500 in the first quarter, down 0.6 percent versus the index's 0.8 percent decline. But the Third Point Ultra fund lost 1.5 percent. In response to increased market volatility and other shifts in the investment environment, Third Point said it has boosted short positions to about a quarter of assets under management, which stood at $17.7 billion as of March 31.

He sees additional near-term corrections gripping stocks as the budget deficit exposes more vulnerabilities to the United States' capacity to do business. \"The fundamentals show that the spenders are in Washington. They're alive and well. The deficit is skyrocketing like never before,\" Paul said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"The market is destined to go down.\" The libertarian's comments came as the Dow kicked off May in the red and briefly fell back into correction territory. The index fell by more than 300 points on Tuesday before closing down by 64 points. The S&P 500 eked out a fractional gain. Even with stocks under pressure, Paul contends the stock market is too expensive. \"The fundamental reason is that we've had too much printing of money \u2014 especially since 1971, especially with the QE. So, everything is artificial. There are big bubbles, so stocks are basically higher,\" he said. The former presidential candidate isn't known for being subtle when it comes to his pullback calls. \"Ultimately, when these corrections have to occur, they always go down a lot more than people expect. Just like they go up higher than people expect,\" Paul said. \"A 50 percent correction with all the distortion that has existed for all these years \u2014 I think it's very possible.\" Paul falls short on offering a timeline, but last August he estimated a correction could be less than a year away. On Feb. 2, his warning became a reality. However, the magnitude was less than 50 percent. Still, he believes a wave of massive selling is still ahead. \"In spite of what looks pretty secure in the economy in the statistics, I think it's in shambles. It's a real mess,\"' he said. There is one investment in particular that Paul deems as safe: gold. He already owns it. But with gold trading around its lowest level of the year and risks looming, Paul is considering buying more. \"I personally would be better off if I did buy a little bit more gold,\" Paul said.

Despite some pushback from global regulators, Wall Street veteran and CEO of Japanese online broker Monex Group says the new crypto asset class could take off like derivatives did 38 years ago. \"Regulators really hated derivatives in 1980 but just soon after that they really embraced them,\" Oki Matsumoto, CEO of Monex, said on stage at the Japan Society in New York Tuesday. \"What's happening in the crypto world today is very similar to derivatives in the 1980s, and sooner or later all of those regulatory frameworks will be fixed.\" The Japanese CEO started his career in derivatives at Solomon Brothers in 1987. Matsumoto later spent 12 years at Goldman Sachs, where he launched the investment bank's yen fixed-income trading desk. Matsumoto now runs Monex, which he established in 1999 with Sony Corporation. This week, Monex Group completed its acquisition of cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, which was the target of a $534 million hack in January. \"We work beautifully together, they can provide a lot of value,\" the CEO said, adding that shares of Monex have doubled since that deal was announced in April. Having a regulated public company in Japan buy a crypto exchange was widely seen as a confidence boost for the space. Similar to cryptocurrency, Matsumoto said the concept of derivatives was confusing in the early days. \"Only a few people could understand derivatives, just the rocket scientists and those people,\" Matsumoto said. \"But five years later, all the biggest schools in the world were teaching derivatives.\" High tax rates on cryptocurrency, which can be as high as 55 percent in Japan, have been a roadblock for retail investors, he said.

Earlier this year, following disappointment over its iPhone sales, Apple announced its plans togo net cash neutral, or an equal amount of cash and debt bringing the balance to zero. It will target to put nearly all its $163 billion in net cash to work, hinting at more stock buybacks, dividends or acquisitions. The company currently has a cash reserve of $267.2 billion. Meanwhile, Apple announced earnings Tuesday after the bell, beating Wall Street's expectations, but sold fewer iPhones than expected.

But what really helped tame investors' fears was the company's announcement of a massive $100 billion stock buyback. \"There's going to be a shift over the next few quarters and couple years where investors are less interested on what the iPhone numbers [are] in any given quarter,\" said Munster, who spent more than two decades as an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \"They'll be more interested in about what they buy back.\" While Apple CEO Tim Cook did not specify a timetable for the buyback during the conference call, Munster predicted it will be faster than expected. \"The last time [Apple] gave a time frame they exceeded that by 25 percent,\" he said. \"If you take the approach that Apple is a very systematic company and they're going to follow the patterns that they've done in the past, you can get to those conclusions.\" Munster rated the quarter as an \"A-,\" and said it wasn't a \"blow-out quarter,\" but there's still room for positive growth. Over the next six months, Munster predicted the buzz around Apple will be in anticipation of new phones, including three models coming out this fall, with one rumored to be 25 percent larger than current models. Meanwhile, Apple executives have said the iPhone X is the most popular phone in China. \"You can sort of read into that, that they think there is more room for higher priced phones,\" he concluded.

Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft are already making the move into connected cars. Amazon expanded Alexa's presence to autos, Microsoft Azure has a car system and Apple offers Carplay for iOS. Google parent Alphabet, meanwhile, is working on an autonomous-driving car through its subsidiary Waymo. Kelly said the most important part of those initiatives is data. \"MOBI is doing the end around and making that data self-sovereign and giving the consumer the control over their data property rights,\" he said. Blockchain technology is what's known as \"decentralized\" and considered by advocates to be unhackable. Bad actors would need to hack multiple systems to alter any information, making the data almost tamper-proof. Some are less convinced. In a recent column, economist Nouriel Roubini called blockchain \"one of the most overhyped technologies ever.\" While there are countless uses for that technology, bitcoin was one of the first applications. The cryptocurrency jumped more than 1,300 percent before losing almost half of its value in the first three months of 2018, according to data from CoinDesk. The MOBI working group is headed up by car industry veteran Chris Ballinger, who left his role as CFO and head of mobility services at Toyota Research Institute last month.

Instead, he recommend considering niche growth areas like avocados. \"Be very specific about what you do. Look for idiosyncratic, value and unusual niches rather than broad assets and broadly passive allocation,\" said Stephen Diggle, founder of Singapore-based Vulpes Investment Management. The firm has invested in agriculture since 2009, putting money into avocado and kiwi cultivation in New Zealand, Diggle told CNBC on the sidelines of the UBS Global Family Office Conference in Singapore. Agriculture has \"got some very good yield characteristics unlike global bonds. It also has some good inflation protection, especially unlike bonds,\" he added. In the case of avocados \u2014 for which millennials have a taste \u2014 Asia is also a huge growth market, Diggle said. \"Hong Kong and Singapore act as the harbingers of what broader Asian consumers do. And right now, Singaporeans and people in Hong Kong are eating avocados and we'd expect more and more Asian consumers to do the same thing,\" said Diggle. \"Income generation from a successful orchard would be way above what you can currently get from a portfolio of safe, low-risk bonds,\" he said. Cryptocurrency 'is probably a bubble' Vulpes has also invested in cyptocurrency \u2014 even as founder Diggle said the space is probably in a \"bubble.\" \"We have a specific strategy, separately investable, that's an arbitrage strategy in cryptocurrencies,\" he told CNBC. \"Now for us, the cryptocurrency bubble \u2014 and it probably is a bubble \u2014 is an opportunity to find widely dislocated prices in essentially the same thing,\" he added. \"Bitcoins don't trade the same on exchanges, they trade at wildly different prices. Last year during the massive ramp up, you could find the same bitcoin trading at 20 percent difference in price in various parts around the world. That for us, creates opportunity,\" he explained. Still, Diggle said he was a \"skeptic\" of cryptocurrencies, but the excitement around the virtual assets generates investment opportunities. \"In the second six months of last year when a lot of people were making money trading long, we made 50 percent by being totally flat,\" he said.

And that could be putting investors at risk. \"They're raising a lot of money, but they're not complying with the rules that are in place to protect investors,\" said Valerie Szczepanik, SEC assistant director of enforcement and head of the agency's working group on cryptocurrencies. Szczepanik spoke at a conference in New York on \"The Future of Financial Fraud,\" staged by the University of California-Berkeley's Center for Law and Business. Roughly $9.8 billion has been raised through ICOs since 2016, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. About $3.5 billion was raised in the first three months of 2018 alone.

Proponents of the currencies say the blockchain technology behind the digital currencies, if properly used, can actually combat fraud, since it creates a virtual ledger with every transaction. \"This technology enables a huge amount of transparency that is unprecedented in financial markets,\" said panelist Jonathan Levin, chief operating officer of Chainalysis, which helps companies identify the sources of funds behind the coin offerings.

Bernie Sanders echoed President Donald Trump's criticism of the e-commerce giant in a tweet this week. \"You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year? Zero,\" the 2016 Democratic presidential hopeful said in a tweet Monday evening. The Vermont senator linked to a Forbes article, which pointed to CEO Jeff Bezos' rise in net worth as Amazon's stock benefited from a huge earnings beat last week. Bezos, the world's richest man by Forbes' estimates, added $9 billion to his own value as the stock shot up. TWEET Trump has publicly confronted the company for its tax practices. The president called Amazon a \"scam\" that costs the post office \"billions,\" and claimed that Bezos pays \"little or no taxes to state and local governments.\" Trump was referring to on Amazon's practice of not collecting state sales taxes for \"third-party\" sellers in most of the U.S., the White House said. As for Sanders' claim, he may technically be correct. The company paid $957 million in total taxes last year, according to Amazon's 2017 annual report. But it appears that money went to state and international taxes and Amazon had a credit for the federal level last year due to perfectly legal maneuvers related to stock-based compensation and the 2017 tax act. Ahead of those tweets, Axios reported that Trump is \"obsessed with\" and wants to \"go after\" the e-commerce giant, citing five sources who have talked about the company with him. TWEET The president also went after Amazon in August, tweeting that \"Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities, and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt \u2013 many jobs being lost!\" Trump has attacked Bezos' other company, the Washington Post, accusing the outlet of publishing fake news. Bezos has largely stayed quiet in response to Trump's affronts. He criticized Trump ahead of the 2016 election and said his behavior \"erodes our democracy.\" Bezos also offered to #sendDonaldtospace, after Trump accused the CEO of a tax \"scam\" involving Amazon and the Post. https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297 WATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become show chapters Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become 9:00 AM ET Sat, 14 April 2018 | 03:56 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/07/29/101877184-jeff-bezos.jpg?v=1539182270", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "2:39 PM ET Tue"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "1"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bernie Sanders"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Donald Trump"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this week"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "Zero"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2016"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Democratic"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "Monday evening"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Vermont"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Forbes"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jeff Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Forbes"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$9 billion"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "TWEET Trump"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "third"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the White House"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Sanders"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$957 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Axios"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Trump"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "five"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "August"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Washington Post"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Trump's"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Trump ahead"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2016"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bezos"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Trump"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Post"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297 WATCH"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "9:00 AM ET Sat"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "14 April 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "03:56"}], "description": "Amazon is now under scrutiny from both sides of the aisle as Bernie Sanders echoes President Trump's criticism of the e-commerce giant.

He calls it an \"arbitrage type of idea,\" one that is looking to take advantage of certain deals in the works. Arbitrage is a tactic that takes advantage of price differences to make profits. For one, Time Warner can offer investors a 5 to 15 percent return if the deal to be bought by AT&T \"goes the right away,\" the Janus Henderson bond fund portfolio manager said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" The fate of that $85 billion deal is now in the hands of a judge after the Justice Department sued to block the merger. A decision is expected in several weeks. He also thinks investors have the potential to get a 5 to 10 percent type of return on Monsanto, and Aetna \"offers even more.\" Bayer is trying to wrap up its pending $62.5 million acquisition of Monsanto, while CVS Health agreed in December to acquire Aetna for $69 billion. \"I'd go convertible equity in terms of these situations to earn a high rate of return with a little bit more risk, obviously.\" Meanwhile, he said there is \"very little incentive\" to invest in the bond market, particularly long-term Treasurys. That's because the 2-year and 5-year Treasury yields aren't much lower than the 10-year benchmark. And those longer-term notes are more volatile, he pointed out. Plus, the bond market is down about 2.5 percent on average for the year, Gross said. \"I would characterize it as a hibernating bear market. One in which the bear is sort of growling but waking up, but not really the grizzly that we know at noontime,\" he said. \"I would go in other directions.\" Fed moves When it comes to the Federal Reserve, Gross predicts another rate rise in June and then maybe one or two more hikes thereafter this year. \"I would expect for the balance of the year in 2018 for maybe an average 30 or 40 basis point hike and not much move in terms of the 10-year,\" he said. The central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged Wednesday. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

The world's biggest private equity firm pushed into car loans in 2011, buying a majority stake in Exeter Finance, a subprime specialist based in Irving, Texas. Blackstone has since injected more than $400m into the company and poached its senior management team from Santander Consumer, the biggest US subprime auto lender. The company's loan portfolio expanded about 10 per cent to $3.4bn in 2017. This year, Exeter has jumped four places in the ranks of the top issuers of securities backed by subprime car loans, according to S&P Global. Exeter has already issued $1.1bn of such securities this year, not far from its 2017 total of $1.4bn, putting it second only to Santander's $3bn. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. \"Exeter has grown its portfolio and is going to grow it even more this year, given its strong performance,\" said Martin Brand, a senior managing director at Blackstone, who oversees the firm's investment in Exeter and other financial institutions. Private-equity firms moved into subprime car loans in the years after the financial crisis, as big banks pulled back under tighter supervisory standards and tougher rules on capital. Perella Weinberg, for example, bought a majority stake in Flagship Credit Acceptance in 2010 while Lee Equity Partners bought out Skopos Financial a year later. But some of these subprime lenders have run into trouble, hurt by losses on loans and the higher cost of funds. Recent closures of private equity-backed lenders include Pelican Auto Finance, shut down by its sponsor, Flexpoint Ford. Flagship, meanwhile, reduced its portfolio by 8.5 per cent through 2017, with losses on recent deals running higher than expected, according to S&P. Flexpoint, Flagship and Perella declined to comment. \"Some companies funded by private equity are decreasing their origination volumes year over year,\" said Amy Martin, head of subprime auto ratings at S&P. \"We think that is a sign of equity not supporting the company with respect to their growth goals but it could also be an indication that they are trying to improve credit quality and tightening lending standards.\" Data on pools of subprime loans originated by Exeter show cumulative net losses of about 20 per cent. That compares with average annualised losses of 8.3 per cent in 2017 across all subprime car loans, according to S&P.

The Fed defines subprime as borrowers with credit scores of less than 620 on the commonly used FICO scale. \"I think [subprime lending] provides an important service because it is often the only way these consumers can get a car and travel to their jobs,\" said Mr Brand of Blackstone. \"Our credit performance is improving year over year, our profitability is improving and our position in the market is improving.\" More from the Financial Times: People love fitness trackers, but should employers give them out?

After years of costly layoffs and plant closings, things are looking up for the heavy-machinery giant Caterpillar, which forecasts solid global sales growth and increased demand this year. Yet despite the corporate investment incentives at the center of President Trump's tax overhaul, the company's executives have no plans to supercharge investment or expansion. Caterpillar's plans for new investment remain low by historical standards. Instead, the company has started using cash to repurchase its own stock as a way to return cash to shareholders, something it hadn't done since 2015. \"We feel we have the necessary bricks-and-mortar capacity that we need,\" Brad Halverson, the company's chief financial officer, said in a post-earnings conference call last Tuesday.

But, so far, hard evidence of such an acceleration has yet to appear in economic data, which show more of a steady investment roll than a rapid escalation. And while there are pockets of the economy where investment is picking up \u2014 among large tech companies and in shale oil business, for example \u2014 corporate spending on buying back stock is increasing at a far faster clip, prompting a debate about whether the law is returning money to the overall economy or just rewarding a small segment of investors. Data on the gross domestic product, released Friday, showed that business investment grew at a 6.1 percent annual clip during the first three months of 2018, down from 7.2 percent during the first quarter last year. Excluding oil and gas investment, which is particularly volatile, the investment pace grew slightly over the past year. While the first-quarter investment numbers were more robust than they were in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 when a bust in oil prices curtailed a large chunk of American corporate spending \u2014 they weren't radically different from the roughly 5 percent rate of growth for business investment that has prevailed since 2010. The White House celebrated those numbers, and the administration's Council of Economic Advisers said in a tweet on Friday that the G.D.P. report reflected \"strong business investment\" as companies responded to the tax overhaul. Tweet Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, attributed the G.D.P. growth to the tax cuts. \"Americans are better off today than they were 16 months ago,\" he said in a statement on Friday. \"Business investment is strong, wages are growing, and disposable income is climbing thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies.\" Analysts were more cautious in drawing conclusions. \"Even regardless of the tax plan kicker, we would have seen a pickup in business investment,\" said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Capital spending, he said, \"typically follows profits with a lag.\" Scott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, warned that it was \"always difficult to identify an economic trend from just one quarter's data.\" Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Economist in remarks published last week that after the tax cuts passed, corporations \"bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.\" A spokeswoman said Monday that Mr. Rubio's criticism was that the law could have done more to help working families while also stimulating corporate investment. While overall business investment in the American economy was up 6.1 percent in the first quarter, business spending by the larger corporations included in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index \u2014 as measured by their announcements of capital expenditures so far this earnings season \u2014 is up 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That would be the fastest pace since 2012. Large tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google's parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers. Amazon increased investment by more than 40 percent to more than $3 billion as it builds out its network of fulfillment centers. But with roughly a quarter of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported first-quarter results, their spending on buybacks is even higher, up 43 percent from the first quarter of 2017, to $43 billion, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Traditionally when companies have more cash than they think they can invest productively, they return it to shareholders either by paying them cash dividends or by going into the market and repurchasing shares. Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper. Republicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares. Boeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year. As they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation's banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks. Republicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy. \"The whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \"We're already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\" A recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies. A survey by the National Association of Manufacturers in April found record-high expectations among members for capital investments this year. Historically, that survey is a strong predictor of future investments, though over the past two years actual investment has underperformed what the survey predicted. A survey by the National Association for Business Economics also finds capital spending expectations rising from a year ago \u2014 but two-thirds of respondents said the new tax law did not cause them to change hiring or investment plans. Morgan Stanley said Monday that its Capex Plans Index for future capital expenditures fell slightly in April, from what had been a record high. Verizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017. But the company plans to stick to its target of spending at most $17.8 billion on investment this year \u2014 a level that has not budged much for the past four years. \"I don't see us having a massive acceleration in capex,\" Verizon's chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, told analysts on its post-earnings conference call.

The Fed funds rate is currently at a target of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. On Wednesday, the Fed opted to hold rates steady, but it is widely expected to announce a hike in June. \"Once we get in the mid 2s, I think the going gets a lot tougher. We have to be very, very careful,\" Kaplan told Steve Liesman on \"Closing Bell.\" That's because he thinks economic growth can start to look sluggish in the future thanks to \"demographics, sluggish productivity [and] high levels of debt-to-GDP.\" He's also keeping his eye on the bond market. The yield curve, which tracks the difference between longer- and shorter-term bond yields, is flattening, meaning they are getting closer together. Investors are concerned it may invert, which means long-term Treasury yields would be lower than short-term yields. Historically, when that happens, an economic recession has usually followed. Kaplan said it would give him \"great pause\" if he was faced with a decision of raising rates and causing the yield curve to invert. \"I'm not going to predict what I will or won't do,\" he said. \"Right now as I sit here, I don't want to knowingly invert the yield curve.\" He believes the flatness in yields \"says we're late cycle.\" He said 2018 will be a good year, with a lot of stimulus.

The 51-year-old asset manager will move its headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to the Tennessee city and relocate about 1,050 jobs beginning later this year, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The company had 3,446 employees worldwide, as of the end of March. Operations directly related to finance, such as the private wealth management business and sell-side research and trading, will remain in New York, the filing said. Legal, compliance, internal audit, human capital, finance, IT, operations and sales and marketing will move to Nashville. The company will invest more than $70 million in the city as part of the relocation, a release said. AllianceBernstein plans to complete its new headquarters by 2020, and finish the entire transition by 2022. \"Moving our corporate headquarters here allows us to offer advantages to our employees that we simply couldn't in the New York metro area,\" president and CEO Seth Bernstein, said during a press conference. He noted lower living expenses, taxes and housing costs, shorter commute times and a more modern work facility. \"We're no Amazon ... but everyone we've interacted with here has treated us as if we were,\" Bernstein said. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said the chief executive will move to the new headquarters. A spokesperson for the asset manager confirmed that Bernstein will move to Nashville along with the company. Like many traditional asset managers focused on stock picking, the firm has struggled to keep up with the industry's shift toward passive investing. AllianceBernstein reported a $6 billion decline in assets under management to $549 billion in March. BlackRock and the other asset management giants that dominate the world of exchange-traded funds have trillions in dollars under management. AllianceBernstein disclosed in a 10-K filing for 2017 that it \"began exploring several U.S. cities for the purpose of establishing a second principal U.S. location.\" A move \"will take place over several-year period,\" CFO John C. Weisenseel said during the firm's earnings call last week, according to a FactSet transcript. \"We would expect to incur transitional costs for the first couple of years before we achieve ongoing expense savings in the future.\" The cost of living is about 58 percent lower in the greater Nashville area than New York, according to Bankrate. Tennessee is also one of a few states with no income tax. \"On the corporate side, Tennessee has continued to eliminate any sense of taxation,\" said Travis H. Brown, author \"How Money Walks,\" a book on how state tax policies influence where Americans choose to live. New York state saw a decline of more than $99 billion in adjusted gross income from 1992 to 2016, while Tennessee gained more than $14 billion over that time, Brown said, citing his analysis of IRS data. AllianceBernstein also occupies an office tower north of Manhattan in White Plains, New York, and has an office in San Antonio and smaller locations in 21 other U.S. cities. The company began in 1967 when Sanford C. Bernstein founded a private securities firm under his own name. It was acquired by Alliance Capital in 2000, and the combined entity rebranded as AB in 2015. Shares fell half a percent in midday trading Wednesday, holding gains of roughly 25 percent over the last 12 months.

The latest jobs report has gotten a lot of analysts, policymakers and talking heads once again asking whether the U.S. is at full employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on May 4 that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent, which is the lowest level since December 2000. The unemployment rate includes anyone 16 or older who is actively searching for work in its calculation, which means students, retirees and others not in the labor force are excluded. Does this mean the economy is at full employment? What is full employment anyway? More from the Conversation: Americans are becoming more socially isolated, but they're not feeling lonelier Should we celebrate Karl Marx on his 200th birthday? Sexism isn't just unfair; it makes women sick, study suggests To the typical person on Main Street, the idea of full employment usually means everyone in the country is working, which would imply a jobless rate of essentially zero. This has never happened. The lowest unemployment rate the U.S. ever achieved was 1.2 percent in 1944. That was during the middle of World War II, when millions of men were drafted to fight and their jobs were filled by women. This popular concept sounds nice, but, to economists like me, it misses the mark. Even in a fully employed, robust economy, there will always be a certain number of people who have given up looking for work, who are between jobs or whose skills are temporarily not needed. Essentially, the idea of full employment is that so few workers are available that companies need to begin raising wages to attract help. Economists technically define full employment as any time a country has a jobless rate equal or below what is known as the \"non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,\" which goes by the soporific acronym NAIRU. Estimates of the measure are based on the historical relationship between the unemployment rate and changes in the pace of inflation. If the unemployment rate is below this number, the economy is at full employment, businesses cannot easily find workers, and inflation and wages typically rise. If not, then there are too many workers in need of a job, and inflation remains low. At the moment, the Congressional Budget Office puts NAIRU at 4.6 percent, a little above the 3.9 percent unemployment rate. That means the U.S. is at full employment \u2013 and that wages should be going up. But until recently, they haven't gained much, which has puzzledmany economists. Besides the impact on wages, another reason it's useful to understand the definition of full employment is because maintaining it is one of the Federal Reserve's key mandates when setting interest rates. The central bank tends to lower rates when unemployment is relatively high and raise them when it believes the economy is at full employment and wages are beginning to go up. In other words, full employment isn't when everyone has a job. Instead, it is when inflationstarts to rise because businesses cannot find enough workers. While the U.S. may be technically at full employment, according to the definition, I won't be convinced until paychecks start increasing. Commentary by Jay L.

David A. Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett The billionaire investor said one type of competitive advantage is when a company is the low-cost producer due to economies of scale or a better business model. Buffett repeatedly has cited the example of Berkshire Hathaway's auto insurance subsidiary Geico, which markets directly to consumers without using local insurance agents. Therefore, the company is able to offer lower prices due to its cost structure. The second type of competitive advantage is when a company owns a powerful product franchise or brand that consumers are willing to pay up for. He used the examples of Coca-Cola and See's Candies as businesses with this type of pricing power. Buffett also shared the important questions he asks when assessing the \"moat\" of a company: \"We are trying to figure out what is keeping \u2014 why is that castle still standing? And what's going to keep it standing or cause it not to be standing five, 10, 20 years from now. What are the key factors? And how permanent are they?

Through the end of April, S&P 500 companies are on track to give back a record $1 trillion to investors through dividend increases and stock buybacks, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Given the environment, availability of cash, increased income expectations, and the 'desire' of companies to show shareholder return, the return to a double-digit actual cash payment gain (year-over-year) seems feasible, along with the first trillion-dollar year of dividends and buybacks for the S&P 500,\" wrote Silverblatt in a note Monday. In the note, he pointed out that 169 S&P 500 members hiked their dividends in the first four months of the year, while no company in the index cut its dividend. That's \"an event not seen since at least 2003 (when my records begin),\" Silverblatt said. He also said, citing initial reports, that buybacks \"produced an outrageous 72% gain due to a few significant issue level increases, but even excluding those buybacks they are up between 25% and 42% depending on the exclusions.\" The strong shareholder returns follow the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Late last year, President Donald Trump signed a bill that cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. But despite the tax cut and the strong shareholder returns expected by Silverblatt, the S&P 500 is down more than 1 percent for 2018, signalling investors may need all the returns they can get.

Snap rose nearly 2 percent in extended trading after the transition was announced. Stone, a vice president of finance at Amazon, comes fresh from Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition, as the company has expanded to physical stores.

There were only five finance team employees, who worked on Quickbooks, when Vollero joined the company three years ago. Snap shares plunged last week after the company's earnings report failed to impress Wall Street.

That same day, bitcoin hit a high of $19,783, according to data from CoinDesk. The Chicago Board Options exchange, or CBOE, also opened a futures market a week earlier but trading there was thin, the letter said. Bitcoin's 12-month performance Source: CoinDesk Until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of bitcoin prices, the researchers said. As optimistic investors continued to bid up, the cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. The pessimists meanwhile, had no financial way to back a belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. \"So they were left to wait for their 'I told you so' moment,\" the researchers said. \"The launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\" As of Monday, bitcoin was trading at about half of its pre-futures peak, near $9,365 as of 3:10 p.m. ET, according to CoinDesk. The researchers compared this price reaction to mortgage-backed securities, which they said hinged on the same driving force of optimistic and pessimistic traders. As for why it was a gradual fall rather than an overnight collapse, researchers said it could be a lack of attention or willingness to enter the market on the first week of trading. Future prices and demand could be helped by any traditional financial institutions becoming more willing to accept bitcoin, and official recognition and regulatory acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payments, they wrote. But a competing cryptocurrency becoming more widely used could cause bitcoin to \"drop precipitously because these tend to be winner-takes-all markets,\" researchers said.

After a career in financial services that has spanned some 53 years, his new adventure will see him switch to strategist for a Hilton Capital Management effort that seeks to capitalize on what he sees as a major opportunity. That comes amid a friendlier regulatory environment and a shift in monetary policy that will see the flow of money slow and interest rates rise. The result, he said, will be a big opportunity for dealmaking as well as other chances to make money in a new phase of growth for real estate. \"All the people who are enormously anti-bank and pro-regulation are gone,\" the Florida-based Bove said during an interview at the New York offices of Rafferty Holdings, the holding company for Hilton Capital. \"We are going into a golden age of banking.\" This is not, however, a golden age for bank analysts. A turn to passive investing, in which investors use exchange-traded funds to track indexes rather than individual stock selection, has made times tougher for sell-side professionals on Wall Street. Many big institutions have dramatically cut what they're paying for analysis, and the trend is likely to continue. For Bove, that climate presents an opportunity to put his long-held ideas to work. 'I'm always flipping out' Normally bullish on the banking sector, Bove in recent years has complained that investors are misunderstanding what drives the industry. While many in the market have focused on the benefits that rising interest rates should bring to banking, Bove sees that as misplaced. Rather, he expects the best opportunities coming for banks that will be able to provide funding at a time when the money supply will be tightening. He also is against banks using large portions of their earnings toward share buybacks, advocating instead that they should be investing in their businesses and focusing in selling rather than financial engineering. \"I've got all these ideas and theories about how money should be invested in the banking industry,\" he said. \"I'm always flipping out about what I think are incorrect views in investing in banks. I want to prove that these theories are correct in a very tangible fashion.\" Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images Dick Bove That philosophy will drive the activist position that he and Hilton will take. He doesn't envision taking hostile positions or trying to pack boards with appointments, but rather will look for cooperative arrangements to improve performance. \"I'm going to be putting my money where my mouth is,\" Bove added. Specifically, they'll be looking for both acquirers and institutions ripe to be taken over. Banks that have been active in takeovers have largely outperformed their peers during this decade, and the action hasn't always come from the industry's most well-known names. For example, Pinnacle Financial Partners, which has completed 12 acquisitions, saw a compound annual growth rate of 28.6 percent from 2012-17, third best in the industry. Another, Glacier Bancorp, has done nine deals and boasts CAGR of 21.8 percent. Too many banks? Those are the kinds of companies Bove's new venture will seek. \"There are way too many banks in the U.S.,\" said Abbott Cooper, senior portfolio manager at Hilton and part of the Bove venture. \"There are chances to buy great banks for great prices.\" That philosophy comes even though the total number of commercial banks in the U.S. has fallen by about a third since the beginning of 2008, when the financial crisis hit in full force. There currently are 4,888 banks, down from a peak of more than 14,000 in 1984. In addition to looking for acquirers, Bove said focusing on geography has worked well, with banks in the Southwest and Midwest performing especially well. That approach, too, will be part of the activist investing thesis for the Hilton team. Bove and Cooper are out raising money now to put that thesis to work.

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett U.S. building products company USG Corp on Tuesday said it agreed to open talks to sell itself to Germany's Gebr Knauf AG, a sale that could benefit Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, USG's largest shareholder. Shares of USG rose to their highest since August 2007. USG had in March rejected a $5.9 billion takeover proposal by Knauf, its second-largest shareholder, that valued the wallboard maker at $42 per share. But USG changed its mind after Berkshire, which holds a roughly 31 percent stake, and two major proxy advisory firms recommended voting against four USG board nominees at the Chicago-based company's May 9 annual meeting. Merger talks may not succeed. USG signaled it might hold out for more than $42 per share and that Knauf \"will see value in excess\" of its original bid. \"Given USG's having publicly endorsed in a recent investor presentation that it views its intrinsic value at $45 to $52 per share, I don't think they're that far apart from getting a deal over the finish line,\" said Garik Shmois, a senior analyst at Longbow Research, who rates USG \"neutral.\" Knauf, which recently held a 10.5 percent USG stake, said it was encouraged by USG's change of heart, although its original all-cash offer still reflected \"full and fair\" value. \"We are pleased that the board has acknowledged shareholders want to see a transaction,\" Knauf said. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In afternoon trading, USG shares were up $1.72, or 4.3 percent, at $41.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. Berkshire has owned a USG stake since 2000, held on as asbestos liabilities helped push USG into a five-year bankruptcy, and provided a $300 million lifeline in 2008 after the housing market imploded. At Berkshire's 2017 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called USG \"not one of my great ideas\" but \"no disaster.\" Berkshire had in March offered to sell its 43.4 million USG shares for at least $42 each, if Knauf bought the rest of USG for that price or more. Knauf would have paid Berkshire $2 per share up front for that privilege. \"It shows that Berkshire has been frustrated with its investment in USG\" and that Knauf's bid was \"close enough,\" Shmois said. A sale would add to Berkshire's roughly $116 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett more ammunition for one or more of the \"huge\" non-insurance acquisitions he has said he wants. Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting will be held on Saturday.

Many accomplished fund managers credited their success to following the Oracle of Omaha's common sense value investing philosophy. Buffett's track record is unparalleled. From 1965 to 2017, Berkshire Hathaway's rising market value generated a 20.9 percent annual return compared to S&P 500's 9.9 percent, resulting in a cumulative gain of 2,404,748 percent versus the market's 15,508 percent return. CNBC researched Buffett's strategy combing through decades of Berkshire Hathaway meeting transcripts using the Buffett Archive to find his best wisdom and strategies for the average investor. Here is what we found. 1) Circle of competence \"Different people understand different businesses. And the important thing is to know which ones you do understand and when you're operating within what I call your circle of competence.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett, 1999 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Buffett stressed the importance looking at companies that are within his areas of expertise to avoid large investing mistakes. He wants to know how a business makes money and be confident on the sustainability of its profit streams over the long-term. He called the process \"judging the future economics of a business.\" He said if an investor is not sure if a company is within his or her circle of competence, it likely is not. 2) Piece of a business \"And I read Ben's [The Intelligent Investor] book in 1949 when I was at University of Nebraska, and that actually just changed my whole view of investing. And it really did, basically, told me to think about a stock as a part of a business \u2026 Once you crank into your mental apparatus that you're not looking at things that wiggle up and down on charts, or that people send you little missives on, you know, saying buy this because it's going up next week, or it's going to split, or the dividend's going to get increased, or whatever, but instead you're buying a business.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett, 2002 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Buffett wasn't born a great investor. He admitted he couldn't make any money in stocks even after reading many investing books as a teenager. But everything changed when Buffett read Ben Graham's classic \"The Intelligent Investor.\" The book's key tenet is to look at each stock purchase as buying a slice of a business and avoid being distracted by stock price movements. Buffett attributed his eventual success to this investing framework. 3) Margin of Safety \"On the margin of safety, which means, don't try and drive a 9,800-pound truck over a bridge that says it's, you know, capacity: 10,000 pounds. But go down the road a little bit and find one that says, capacity: 15,000 pounds.\" \u2014 Warren Buffett, 1996 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting When Buffett analyzes a prospective investment, he wants the value at his entry price to be much lower than his value estimate for the company. The difference between the two figures is his \"margin of safety,\" which limits the size of losses in case there are errors in his business analysis or assumptions. \"The margin of safety concept boils down to getting more value than you're paying,\" Buffett's partner Charlie Munger once said. show chapters Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger shares his advice for living a rich and successful life 8:27 AM ET Wed, 16 Aug 2017 | 01:07 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/23/105152185-_Y2A0156.JPG?v=1524503955", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Graham"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "4:02 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "3"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Omaha"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1965 to 2017"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway's"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "20.9 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "annual"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "9.9 percent"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "2,404,748 percent"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "15,508 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "decades"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Archive"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "1"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1999"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "2"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Piece"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ben"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "The Intelligent Investor"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1949"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "University of Nebraska"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "next week"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2002"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ben Graham's"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "The Intelligent Investor"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "3"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "9,800-pound"}, {"category": "QUANTITY", "term": "10,000 pounds"}, {"category": "QUANTITY", "term": "15,000 pounds"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1996"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "two"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Charlie Munger"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett's"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Charlie Munger"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:27 AM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "16"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Aug 2017"}], "description": "Warren Buffett believes investors should buy stocks within their \"circle of competence\" and at attractive values to succeed in the stock market.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffetts-three-best-investing-tips-explained.html", "author": "", "title": "Warren Buffett's new archive reveals the billionaire's 3 best investing tips"}, {"time": "2018-05-03T17:56:47-0400", "body": " Adam Jeffery | CNBC Les Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS Corp.

In the first quarter, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought an astounding 75 million shares of Apple. That adds to the 165.3 million shares Berkshire already owned at the end of 2017.

The Oracle of Omaha explained why investors should avoid market predictions during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in 1994, obtained through the CNBC Warren Buffett archive. \"I never have an opinion about the market because it wouldn't be any good and it might interfere with the opinions we have that are good,\" Buffett said. \"If we're right about a business, if we think a business is attractive, it would be very foolish for us to not take action on that because we thought something about what the market was going to do. \u2026 If you're right about the businesses, you'll end up doing fine.\" Bill Pugliano | Getty Images Warren Buffett Buffett said it is a \"mistake\" to not invest in a great company due to market worries. The billionaire shared he first started buying stocks in 1942 as an 11-year-old during a troubled point for the U.S. in World War II. He cited scary developments over the decades from major wars, atomic weapons, massive inflation and periods of political turmoil. If an investor avoided the market because of these macro concerns, he or she would have missed out on large equity gains. Counterintuitively, Buffett said the worst environment for a long-term investor is a surging stock market. \"The best thing that can happen from Berkshire's standpoint \u2026 over time is to have markets that go down a tremendous amount,\" he said. \"We are going to be buyers of things over time.

But I think you're absolutely right. It's where they should be looking.\" The optimism on China comes as BYD's Hong Kong-traded shares have tumbled 22.8 percent this year, after the company forecast a nearly 82.6 percent to 71 percent drop in net profit attributable to shareholders for the first half of this year. BYD attributed the decline to reduced subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. In September 2008, Berkshire bought 225 million shares of BYD for an 8.25 percent stake. Since then, shares have climbed about 480 percent even with the decline of the last few months. A first quarter report from BYD showed Berkshire still held its 8.25 percent stake, now worth about $1.5 billion. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire, \"deserves 100 percent of the credit for BYD,\" Buffett said in 2010, according to the CNBC Warren Buffett archive. show chapters Munger: China's BYD is a \"damn miracle\" 1:46 PM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 | 02:52 One of Munger's close friends, Li Lu, introduced the investor to BYD. Li's Himalaya Capital Investors controls LL Group, which had a 2.76 percent stake in BYD, according to the automaker's 2017 annual report. BYD is based in southern China and opened its North American headquarters in Los Angeles in 2011. Several regional transportation authorities in the U.S. use BYD vehicles, and the company said it makes more than half of all U.S. battery-electric buses. \"BYD remains highly optimistic about the future,\" Macy Neshati, senior vice president for BYD's coach, bus, truck and material handling unit, said in a statement Tuesday. In an interview with CNBC in November, he predicted \"tremendous growth over the next 12 years.\" The trend of electric vehicles, \"I think that's going to spread out to the world quickly,\" Neshati said. \"China has done a tremendous job of setting the bar very high.\" In September, Xin Guobin, China's vice minister of industry and information technology, said Beijing is considering a ban on production and sales of fossil fuel cars. The country is already the world's largest market for electric vehicles. Here's why Munger liked BYD, according to his comments in 2009: BYD is one of the main manufacturers to the world of the rechargeable lithium battery. And it achieved that position from a standing start at zero under the leadership of the founder, Wang Chuanfu. And \u2014 they went on into cell phone components and developed a huge position. And then, finally, not satisfied with having worked a couple of miracles, Wang Chuanfu decided he would go into the automobile business. As nearly as I can tell, it was zero experience in automobiles. And from a standing start at zero and with very little capital, he rapidly was able to create the best-selling single model in China. And that's against competition that was Chinese joint ventures with all the major auto companies of the world, technological marvels with way more capital and so on. This is not some unproven, highly speculative activity. What it is, is a damn miracle. ... I don't want to bet against 17,000 Chinese engineers led by Wang Chuanfu, plus 100,000 more talented Chinese in a brand-new area \u2014 constructed the way they want it. I will be amazed, if great things don't happen here. I don't think, given the size, it can be all that important to Berkshire, financially. But I have never, in my life, been more \u2014 felt more privileged to be associated with something than I feel about BYD. Munger still liked BYD three years later in 2012. \"It's a very interesting start-up company,\" he said, although the noted investors didn't expect many cars in 2030 would be electric. One of the challenges for Berkshire to invest more in China is restrictions on foreign investment. \"It's very hard to imagine that we won't find more things to do in China over time. I mean, it's a huge market,\" Buffett said in 2009. \"And there will also, perhaps, be opportunities to buy more businesses there.\" \"We would've bought more than 10 percent of BYD, if we could've. But, that's all that they wished to sell us. So we hope that comes about.\" BYD didn't come up specifically in Saturday's annual meeting. In fact, the investing duo hasn't mentioned the company by name during an annual meeting since 2013, according to a search using the CNBC Warren Buffett archive. But Munger said Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he still thinks China has better investment opportunities than the U.S. \"Charlie, Charlie actually keeps pushing me to do more in China,\" Buffett said during Saturday's meeting. Back in 2009, Buffett said it was generally a good idea to heed his investment partner's advice. \"And Charlie, when he gets to the point where he really wants me to do something, like buy the BYD interest or something, he always says to me, 'Well,' he says, 'in the end, you'll see it my way. Because you're smart, and I'm right.'\" WATCH: US-China must develop constructive relationship show chapters Munger: It would be insane for US and China not to develop a constructive relationship 5:34

Weerasinghe/Getty Images Cranes stand during the sunset at a construction site at the hotel complex construct by Chinese company on October 15, 2015 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Warnings of financial risks may be sounding on China's Belt and Road Initiative, but global banks are still seeing a promising opportunity. In an interview with CNBC, Marc Merlino, Citi's global head for its global subsidiaries group, said there are opportunities for not just banks, but institutional and corporate investors. The initiative aims to connect Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a vast logistics and transport network, using roads, ports, railway tracks, pipelines, airports, transnational electric grids and even fiber optic lines. It's widely seen as an attempt by China to construct a massive, multi-national zone of economic and political influence that has Beijing at its core. For investors, there are \"multiple levels\" of potential opportunities, Merlino said, highlighting infrastructure and activities surrounding major projects under the plan. \"It's the opportunities for micro infrastructure beyond the core projects. All the knock-on effects ... if building a railroad, there's going to be a lot of goods and services moving. You need warehouses, you need distribution capabilities. That's where private investors are getting more involved.\" \"I think the risk associated with construction of large projects is well understood in the banking sector.\" -Marc Merlino, Citi's global head for its global subsidiaries group According to a recent report published by Nomura, new projects will create demand for goods and infrastructure. That economic boost will benefit both lenders and brokers, it said. In fact, Citi is seeing increased corporate and institutional investment in the Belt and Road, which Merlino said will be bigger than the numbers published by the Chinese government. The Nomura report, quoting numbers from China's Ministry of Commerce, said Chinese enterprises invested $14.4 billion in Belt and Road-related projects in 2017 \u2014 accounting for 12 percent of China's total outbound foreign direct investment. More than 7,200 new contracts on initiative-related projects were signed for a total value of $144.3 billion. Banks have a role in the initial construction phase and long-term debt financing, but Citi has also been putting in \"a lot of resources\" into supporting multinational companies involved in the initiative, he said. That's despite the risks that have been associated with the mammoth initiative. A study in March found that debt risks in eight countries have been elevated because of their participation. In fact, 23 of the 68 countries identified as potential borrowers were found to be at a \"quite high\" risk of debt distress, the study found. The Nomura report, too, flagged the risks. \"Infrastructure projects may face long payback periods, uncertain returns and potential default risk due to regulatory or political risk in the recipient economy, increasing financial risks for the investing (Chinese or other) entity,\" it said. But Merlino said that, despite such warnings, the banking industry is \"well positioned\" for that higher risk. \"I think the risk associated with construction of large projects is well understood in the banking sector. Generally, that tends to be a slightly higher risk than corporate kind of risks because you have completion risks, geopolitical risks. But I think the banking industry understands that and is well positioned to deal with that,\" he said. Plus, there will be investors who can fill in any gaps, he indicated. \"The good news is that there are quite a bit of institutional investors with appetite, whether it's insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, for long-term debt. The best solution would be risk distribution into the appropriate hands ... to ensuring there's a match between investor risk appetite and actual underlying risk of the projects,\" he said.

Cohn resigned in early March from his role as chief economic advisor to the Trump administration.

However, bitcoin has run into challenges such as handling high transaction volume. Cohn expects the digital coin of the future will be simpler than bitcoin. \"It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency,\" he said. \"It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it's created, how it moves and how people can use it.\" A surge of interest in bitcoin, and expectations for large-scale institutional investment, helped drive prices up more than 13 times last year. Bitcoin traded near $9,100 Tuesday morning. Cohn's former employer, Goldman Sachs, is one of a few Wall Street firms making a deliberate foray into cryptocurrencies. Last month, the investment bank hired former trader Justin Schmidt to be the first head of digital asset markets in Goldman's securities division. \"They should do what they think's in the best interests of their shareholders,\" Cohn said of Goldman. He said he no longer owns any shares of the company.

India's largest lender posted its first quarterly loss in 17 years for the three months ended in December, but its chairman told CNBC that the rest of the year looks much better. The State Bank of India reported a net loss of 24.16 billion rupees ($361.8 million) for the December quarter, compared with a profit of 18.20 billion rupees ($272.5 million) a year earlier. The bank blamed lower trading income from higher bond yields, higher loan loss provisions and significant investment depreciation for the loss. \"Two factors are impacting our profit. Loan loss provision takes the large chunk,\" Rajnish Kumar, chairman of SBI, told CNBC's Oriel Morrison in Manila, the Philippines, on Friday. \"Dictated costs are very, very elevated and not affordable.\" Loan loss provisions are counted as expenses that are set aside as allowance for uncollected loans and loan payments. SBI said its gross non-performing assets increased from 1.86 trillion rupees ($27.8 billion) in September to a staggering 1.99 trillion rupees ($29.8 billion) as of December. \"Last year, in terms of profits, in terms of asset quality, it was a big challenge,\" Kumar said. \"But this year onward, we are expecting that we will be in a much better position and this year looks much, much better.\" SBI will release its full fiscal 2018 earnings on May 22, according to Kumar. In India, the financial year usually starts on Apr 1. Huge problems with bad debts for banks Kumar's comments come in the midst of serious problems for India's banking sector. Banks, which are a key source of funding for Indian companies, have struggled in recent years as bad debts have risen and instances of fraud have come to light. show chapters India needs to address 'structural' issues at state-owned banks 8:31 PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 | 02:29 Stressed loans from local banks came to about $146 billion at the end of June last year, according to reports. That included non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans. The Reserve Bank of India's financial stability report said in December that large borrowers accounted for more than 80 percent of bad debt in portfolios of scheduled commercial banks in September \u2014 those include public sector and private sector Indian banks, regional rural banks and private foreign banks. Public-sector banks wrote off bad loans worth 2.41 trillion rupees ($36 billion) between April 2014 and September 2017, according to local reports that cited government sources. Banks usually write off bad debts or non-performing assets to clean up their balance sheets Short-term pain ahead This week, Moody's Investors Service said that an ongoing Reserve Bank of India push to make local banks accurately recognize bad assets will reduce near-term profits in the sector. But there will be benefits over the long term, the ratings agency said. The Reserve Bank of India tightened guidelines for banks to resolve bad assets in February. Under the new rules, banks can't use loan restructuring schemes to delay recognizing bad debt. \"The Reserve Bank of India's rules are credit positive because they provide a clearer, time-bound process for resolving stressed assets and will prevent a future buildup of problem loans in the system,\" Alka Anbarasu, vice president and senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, said in a note. Banks have recognized many loans as bad assets since 2015, Moody's said. But the banks still hold many restructured loans that will go bad in the coming quarters, according to the ratings agency. \"For every delinquent loan, banks now must implement a resolution plan within 180 days of the initial default,\" analysts at Moody's said. \"If a bank fails to implement a resolution plan in time, it must refer that asset for insolvency proceedings.\" Moody's added that as banks reclassify those assets, non-performing loan ratios will gradually rise. But once the process is complete, they will stabilize and eventually decline. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

In a separate statement, Nestle said it expected the business to contribute positively to its earnings per share and organic growth targets from 2019. show chapters Starbucks CEO: We are introducing Chinese customers to premium coffee 10:24 AM ET Fri, 27 April 2018 | 01:02 A company source said it would pay market-linked royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee. It will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal. Nestle, which will take on about 500 Starbucks employees as part of the deal, says its ongoing share buyback program would remain unchanged. The agreement will strengthen Nestle's position in the United States, where it is only the No. 5 player with less than 5 percent of the market. Market leader Starbucks itself only has a 14 percent share, according to Euromonitor International. \"Nestle is far and away the largest hot drinks company globally, with more in sales than the next five largest hot drinks companies combined,\" Matthew Barry, an analyst at Euromonitor said on Friday when the tie-up was first mooted. \"However, Nestle's leadership position is less secure than it once was.\" Other big players are growing as well, including Italy's Lavazza, which is now the world's No. 3. Nestle's new Chief Executive Mark Schneider last year identified coffee as a strategic area for investment for the company known for Nescafe instant coffee and Nespresso home espresso brewers. It bought Texas-based Chameleon Cold-Brew in November and took a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, a small upscale cafe chain, in September. The company is under shareholder pressure to improve its performance, which has suffered for years as consumers migrate to fresher brands. Starbucks, which in April reported a global drop in quarterly traffic to its established cafes, has been revamping its business as it battles high and low-end competition in its key home market. It sold its Tazo tea brand to Unilever for $384 million and closed underperforming Teavana retail stores. show chapters Broad consensus among investors that we're going in the right direction: Nestle CEO 5:10 AM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 03:09 Starbucks is rapidly expanding its business in China, which it expects to one day be its largest market. It also plans to open 1,000 upscale Starbucks Reserve stores and a handful of Roastery coffee emporiums as part of a broad strategy to defend against high-end coffee rivals such as Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle. Starbucks has long farmed out the retail distribution of its packaged products to a company more specialized in that process, but the partnerships have not always been smooth. Privately held Acosta Inc picked up that U.S. business in 2011 after Starbucks cited brand mismanagement and ended a 12-year relationship with Kraft Foods. The cafe chain's partnership with Kraft had been due to end in 2014, but Starbucks sought an early exit and was later forced by an arbitrator to pay $2.76 billion to Kraft, which by then had split into two. The payment went to Mondelez International. Nestle, also the world's largest packaged food company, is also not shy when it comes to partnering with rivals, whether through licensing deals or joint ventures. Nestle sells General Mills' Haagen-Dazs brand in the United States and Hershey sells Nestle's KitKat in the United States. Nestle also has joint ventures with General Mills for cereal, Lactalis for dairy products and R&R for ice cream.

Citigroup 12:31 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 03:41 Big U.S. banks have lower risk and greater structural advantages than at any time in decades, ValueAct Capital Partners wrote in an investor letter explaining why it took a $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup this year. ValueAct, led by co-founder Jeffrey Ubben, said Monday that the financial industry is poised for a rebound like other formerly out-of-vogue sectors such as software firms after the dot-com crash and pharmaceutical companies on the eve of patent expirations, according to a quarterly letter obtained by CNBC. The activist firm also owns stakes in Morgan Stanley and KKR. \"The U.S. banking system now has a structurally lower risk profile than any time in our investing lifetimes'' thanks to lower leverage and higher-quality assets held by the industry after the financial crisis, ValueAct said. Ann Johansson | Corbis | Getty Images Jeffrey Ubben, CEO of ValueAct Capital Partners \"Banks are now primarily engaged in the simple functions that are the lifeblood of our economic system: safeguarding assets, providing access to deposited cash on demand, lending money, processing payments and accessing capital markets on behalf of clients.'' While bank stocks have rebounded sharply in the past five years as memories of the financial crisis fade, not all companies have kept up. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has lagged the shares of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America. Citi CEO Michael Corbat has led turnaround efforts, including exiting overseas markets and shedding $800 billion in assets, but that work has been underappreciated, ValueAct said. \"We have been having constructive conversations with ValueAct and welcome them as investors,'' Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, said in a statement sent to CNBC. The bank should take more actions, including replacing Chairman Michael O'Neill and selling its Mexican operations by year-end, Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\" Those types of changes will help the firm boost its market value, which trades below the estimated value of the businesses within the firm, Mayo said. \"People are frustrated, aggravated, this is a stock that's still well below its pre-crisis heights,'' Mayo said. \"You now have an activist in Citigroup stock. They said it wasn't possible; it's been done.'' ValueAct said its thesis on financial stocks was developed when it was evaluating a $1.1 billion investment in Morgan Stanley, which it disclosed in August 2016. That investment reaped returns for ValueAct as investors began to recognize the moves that CEO James Gorman had made to focus on wealth management and improve fixed income trading operations. Since August 2016, Morgan Stanley shares have more than doubled. ValueAct currently owns 1 percent, according to FactSet. ValueAct's stakes in financials, including a holding in credit card services company Alliance Data, now total more than a third of its $13 billion in assets. It took on a stake in KKR in July 2017, and the shares have risen 18 percent since then. ValueAct currently has a 10.2 percent stake, according to FactSet. It also has a 10.6 percent stake in Alliance Data, which it began acquiring in April 2016. Shares of that company are down 6 percent since then. While previous eras were defined by acquiring competitors to become financial supermarkets or wagering capital in trading markets, the industry is now in a different period, ValueAct said. Banks are now in an era where the winners will invest heavily in technology to deepen relationships with customers, focus on core activities in leading businesses and focus on the well-telegraphed return of capital to investors, the firm said. That favors the biggest institutions that have the scale needed to spend billions of dollars on technology. That was part of its rationale for investing in Citigroup, which ValueAct says has leading positions in low-risk businesses that serve global corporations like cash management, payments and receivables processing, and payroll. \"While seemingly mundane, these are attractive markets demonstrating consistent and sustainable growth,'' ValueAct said. \"They are scale businesses that rely on complex internal technology as a core part of operations, and deliver their product to customers primarily via digital platforms.'' Citigroup can return $50 billion in capital to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next two years and double its earnings per share by 2020, ValueAct said.

Together, the two have created an empire worth nearly $500 billion. And as they get older, some shareholders say they want to make sure they have that in-person experience before it's too late. \"They are in their 80s and 90s and I wanted to see them before they retired,\" said Peng Chen, a 36-year-old man from Vancouver, who attended the so-called Woodstock for Capitalists for the first time this year. Fred Imbert | CNBC Attendees arrive at the 2018 Annual Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder's Meeting in Omaha, NE on May 4th, 2018. The two men have had several books written about their approach to investing. Over the years, investors have tried to apply those teachings into their own portfolios. Buffett turns 88 in August and Munger turned 94 in January. They have been working together about 40 years, when Buffett's Berkshire bought Wesco Financial, a company that was run by Munger. According to Forbes, Buffett and Munger are worth $82.9 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. Attendance at Berkshire's annual meeting has also grown explosively over the years. In 1986, about 1,000 people were present at the meeting. Last year, approximately 42,000 people attended the event. \"My brothers and I come here every year.

The fact that more public companies are being acquired by large global private equity firms is neither shocking nor problematic, at least according to the titans of private equity. It's hardly surprising that boards of formerly public companies elect to give private equity a chance, said Jonathan Sokoloff, managing partner of Leonard Green & Partners. \"Our view is that we're a better model. We're a better model for governance. We don't have to deal with all the hassles of the public boards,\" Sokoloff told CNBC's Leslie Picker at the Milken Global Investment Conference last Tuesday. \"You go to a private company board meeting: we get right down to the meat of the business, and we help the businesses and we're involved,\" he added. \"It's a pretty dramatic shift that's going on, and the public equity markets are really losing share.\" show chapters Bain & Co: Private equity funds attracting record amount of capital 4:16 AM ET Wed, 28 Feb 2018 | 02:45 Other private equity managers on the panel echoed Sokoloff's comments. The panelists also included Apollo Global Management's Leon Black, Vista Equity Partners' Robert Smith and Brookfield Asset Management's Bruce Flatt. According to a Credit Suisse report published in 2017, the number of publicly traded U.S. companies has been cut in half over the past 20 years, falling to 3,671 from 7,322 in the two decades ending in 2016. While private equity buyouts can account for some of the drop in the number of public companies, some executives of companies such as Uber and Airbnb are simply electing to delay their IPOs. Their explanations for the delay have ranged from increased regulation in the public sphere to shareholder lawsuits and activist pressure. While notable in its own right, the decline in the number of public companies has been accompanied by a mass migration of capital into private equity as some of the world's largest pension funds remain strapped for reliable returns. Source: Credit Suisse Private equity raised a record $453 billion from investors in 2017, bringing the available pool of money to invest to $1 trillion, industry tracker Preqin said earlier this year. The amount of money raised exceeded the previous record of $414 billion set in 2007. Much of the new capital flow has helped balloon so-called megafunds (those with more than $4.5 billion), with raises for all buyout megafunds up over 90 percent year over year, according to McKinsey, which concluded that had growth in the largest funds stalled in 2017, overall fundraising would have fallen by 4 percent. At the top of the list of top fundraisers, Apollo took in $24.6 billion last year, and the firm manages a total of $69 billion in private equity assets. Black said that taking a public company private is a natural step in the business life cycle and gives companies a chance to implement initiatives without increased regulatory or public scrutiny. \"What happens when a company goes private?\" Black said. \"It is private for a while, it doesn't have to report quarter-to-quarter, things can get done \u2014 as John said \u2014 more efficiently. And then there's an exit.\" The flood of cash into private equity, however, has attracted the criticism of federal regulators, especially as managers look to foreigners for cash. In its most recent move, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2014 which monitors and reviews potential national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies \u2014 warned President Donald Trump against allowing Singapore-based Broadcom's hostile takeover of San Diego-based Qualcomm to go through. CFIUS, which rarely weighs in publicly on a deal it is scrutinizing, told both companies it was concerned that Broadcom could use a \"'private-equity'-style\" approach to Qualcomm, slashing investments in research and development as part of a focus on short-term profitability. Broadcom was forced to abandon the Qualcomm bid. Private equity executives often say their ownership of private companies creates a better relationship between owners and management compared with publicly traded companies, where managers may hold a very small amount of the company's stock, and so their incentives aren't necessarily aligned with other stakeholders. \"The fact of the matter is, private equity has just, frankly, a better alignment of incentives between stakeholders, stockholders, management and the company,\" said Smith, founder and chairman of San Francisco-based Vista Equity Partners, which focuses on software and technology companies. \"The challenge, I think, that the public markets have run into is that often the managers of those businesses don't actually have a meaningful stake in the companies any longer,\" he said. \"That fundamental difference in alignment is why I think the private equity model is going to continue to gain momentum.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/02/105179039-RTS1PH9M.jpg?v=1525369392", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Lucy Nicholson"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Reuters Leon Black"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Apollo Global Management"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "LLC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Milken Institute's"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Beverly Hills"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "California"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 1, 2018"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jonathan Sokoloff"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Leonard Green & Partners"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Sokoloff"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Leslie Picker"}, {"category": "LAW", "term": "the Milken Global Investment Conference"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last Tuesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bain & Co"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "4:16 AM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "28"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Feb 2018"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "02:45"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Sokoloff"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Apollo Global Management's"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Leon Black"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Vista Equity Partners'"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Robert Smith"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Brookfield Asset Management's"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bruce Flatt"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Credit Suisse"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "half"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past 20 years"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "3,671"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "7,322"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the two decades ending in 2016"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Uber"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Airbnb"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Credit Suisse Private"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "a record $453 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$1 trillion"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Preqin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "earlier this year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$414 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2007"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "more than $4.5 billion"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "over 90 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "McKinsey"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "4 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Apollo"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$24.6 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$69 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Black"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Black"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "quarter-to-quarter"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "John"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Committee on Foreign Investment"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "the United States"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Donald Trump"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Singapore"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Broadcom"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "San Diego"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Qualcomm"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CFIUS"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Broadcom"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Qualcomm"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Qualcomm"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Smith"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "San Francisco"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Vista Equity Partners"}], "description": "More public companies being acquired by global private equity firms isn't shocking or problematic, private equity titans say.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/the-stock-market-is-shrinking-and-thats-a-good-thing-private-equity-honchos-say.html", "author": "Lucy Nicholson | Reuters", "title": "The stock market is shrinking and that's a good thing, private equity honchos say"}, {"time": "2018-05-04T14:03:38-0400", "body": " Victor J.

On Wednesday, the Fed held rates at a target of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. In its post-meeting statement, the central bank also indicated that inflation is beginning to creep higher and used the term \"symmetric\" when referring to its target. \"Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,\" the statement said.

Demand for U.S. soybeans remains strong, regardless of worries China could target the crop in retaliation over Trump administration tariffs. China has canceled several shipments of U.S. soybeans in the last month, raising questions over whether the country is taking preemptive action against the U.S. by reducing purchases. But analysts say the reduction is a minor amount and is not that surprising from a seasonal perspective. The \"U.S. accounts for 37 percent of total soybean exports throughout the world. Beyond Brazil, there's really nobody else,\" said Rich Nelson, director of research at Allendale, an agricultural market research and trading firm. \"Despite the trade concerns, there's really nobody else. You're just simply not going to have a massive decline in U.S. soybean exports,\" he said. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Chinese cancellations of U.S. soybean orders for the week ended April 26 resulted in a decline of 133,700 metric tons in net sales to China, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service data showed Thursday. But 66,000 metric tons of those soybeans were sent to Vietnam instead, the data showed. Meanwhile, the U.S. sold 82,700 metric tons of soybeans in new sales to Mexico, 68,800 to Taiwan, 60,000 to Argentina and 52,600 to the Netherlands. Although Argentina is the third-largest exporter of soybeans, a severe drought has reduced production by 7 million tons to 40 million, according to USDA estimates. \"That just goes to show we're not dependent on China for soybean exports,\" said Michael Stumo, head of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a nonprofit representing the interests of those in manufacturing, agriculture and labor unions. show chapters How Chinese businesses can adapt to tariffs on soybeans: New Hope Group 10:41 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 02:58 \"China buys so much soybeans they will be unable to avoid the U.S. market anyway,\" Stumo said. Soybean futures are up 9.5 percent this year following planned Chinese tariffs on the U.S. product and other goods in retaliation for the Trump administration's proposed duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports. The futures rose nearly 1 percent in Thursday trading. The lack of Chinese purchases in April also reflects a seasonal slowdown in demand. \"We are now into the season where China almost exclusively buys from Brazil,\" said Ted Sefried, chief market strategist at brokerage Zaner Ag Hedge. \"We would expect China cancellations of switches of origin, unless there was a big problem with the Brazilian crop, which there is not this year,\" he said. Net sales of US soybeans to China tend to fall off in the first half of the year Source: Thomson Reuters, US Census Bureau In fact, U.S. soybean exports overall to China were expected to decline in the current marketing year, which ends Aug. 31, due to a historical low in U.S. soybean protein content, Allendale's Nelson said. The real worry, he said, is whether China reduces its demand for U.S. soybeans in the coming marketing year, which begins Sept. 1. So far, USDA data indicates China has been increasing orders for that year, and has 1.02 million tons of U.S. soybeans on the books. \u2014 CNBC's Aditi Roy contributed to this report.

It's already considered to be the most cashless society in the world. More Swedes have access to a payment card than to cash, according to data from the country's central bank, the Riksbank. And the overwhelming majority of the nation \u2014 85 percent \u2014 have access to online banking. The Scandinavian country has seen the circulation of notes and coins as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) drop year after year, as Swedes make less withdrawals and look to digital methods of paying for things, like cards and mobile. Just 2 percent of the total value of transactions in Sweden consist of cash, and this is expected to decline to less than half a percent by 2020, according to research by Capgemini and BNP Paribas. The situation has gotten to a stage where the central bank has had to warn on the rapid rate at which physical cash is being phased out of Swedes' lives. Earlier this year, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said that a completely cashless society would mean a small number of commercial players being responsible for all payments in Sweden, posing a threat to the infrastructure for payments. A cashless Sweden could be unprepared if faced with a crisis, he added. Demand for cash would likely increase in a crisis situation, the Riksbank said, but with less notes and coins in circulation, supply would be restrained. Another problem is that some people in Sweden have little to no access to digital payment services \u2014 and some don't want to go digital. \"Our own starting point really is that we provide notes and coins to the society to the extent that society wants to use our version of money versus other versions of money as long as it is safe and efficient,\" Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of Riksbank, told CNBC in a phone interview. \"But we have noticed this rapid development, we have noticed that there are a number of people and there a number of situations and their geographies where cash is absolutely vital.\" Elderly people and refugees are among those that would need access to physical cash even if the overwhelming majority of the country don't, Skingsley said. Sweden could eventually \"reach a situation where legal tender is no longer an efficient medium of exchange for commercial transactions and that it is a situation that no other country has been in before,\" Skingsley said. show chapters A world without cash: Could it happen? 6:58 AM ET Mon, 18 June 2018 | 02:34 A cross-party parliamentary committee in Stockholm is currently reviewing central bank legislation to examine whether banks should be forced to provide cash services for their customers. Increasingly bank branches are refusing to offer over the counter cash services, due to weakening demand. Why are Swedes barely using cash? Sweden is a unique economy when it comes to payments. It's home to a popular instant payment app called Swish, set up in 2012 by seven of the largest banks in the country. More than half of Swedish consumers are signed up to the app. It's also got a booming tech scene, with homegrown giants like Spotify and Microsoft-owned Skype, as well as fintech start-ups like iZettle and Klarna. But another reason for the fall in physical cash is the fact that retailers don't have to offer it. \"It's a bit of an anomaly in the Swedish legal system because if you look at the Riksbank Act it says pretty straightforward that the Swedish krona is legal tender and it should be compulsory to accept that for settling transactions,\" Riksbank's Skingsley said. \"But there are other parts in legislation that creates exemptions. Given that the technology has moved to the extent that it's moved, it is perfectly possible to live in Stockholm for example without ever using cash.\" To address the rapid direction toward cashlessness, one option being tabled by the central bank is a government-backed virtual currency called the ekrona. Not much is known about the technical details of this digital currency yet. The project is currently in the second year of a two year pre-study. \"As technology jumps forward and people are changing preferences we have to think long and hard about what the public sector offers to people when it comes to money and how do we facilitate people living in society getting access to money in the forms and shapes they prefer them to be,\" Skingsley said. The central bank is not keen on the idea of cryptocurrencies however. \"Cryptocurrencies are so far very poor versions of money,\" Skingsley said. She said that the likes of bitcoin and ethereum are not a stable store of value or an efficient means of exchange. show chapters How to build a cashless society? Give people no other choice 11:45 AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 | 04:08 Many shops, restaurants and bank branches refuse to handle cash because of how little consumers use it, with retailers putting up signs to say they don't accept cash payments all over the country. Just 20 percent of payments in shops are made in cash, according to Riksbank, a figure that pales in comparison to other countries. In the U.K. for instance, cash payments account for 42 percent of retail transactions, according to the British Retail Consortium. Jacob de Geer, CEO of iZettle, supported the idea of a government-backed digital form of currency. \"I think it's a really compelling idea that government-controlled banks could issue electronic cash,\" he said. \"I think it's very progressive and it's smart to go about it that way to be able to control the monetary flows.\" De Geer said his business \u2014 which provides mobile card readers and other digital payment products to small businesses \u2014 was benefiting from the trend. \"It's part of our raison d'etre,\" he said. But cash is still relevant in many people's lives, the entrepreneur said, adding: \"I think there still will be a role for physical cash in societies.\" Will Sweden be the first to go cashless? Sweden certainly seems to be in the lead when it comes to cashlessness, but a number of other countries are seeing similar trends. Neighboring countries Norway and Denmark are thought to be close behind, and the U.K. is seeing its own shift towards digital payments. In Britain, a wave of digital banks are emerging that offer just an app and a contactless debit card. Whether Sweden becomes the first to become cashless depends on the likelihood of the country's legislature tightening central bank legislation to create protections for cash, the Riksbank's Skingsley said. \"We are a candidate (for cashlessness) for sure but nobody knows what the future holds.

Omaha, Neb. \u2013 Tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have traveled to this Midwestern city to hear Warren Buffett lead the company's annual meeting but also to take part in annual rituals like the 5K walk/run, the steak dinner, and the bargain underwear shopping. \"Everybody needs clean underwear,\" said Carol Anglen, a 76-year-old woman from Omaha who has been a shareholder for 20 years. Anglen was one of hundreds of people lined up next to the Fruit of the Loom booth in the CenturyLink Center, the exhibition space where Berkshire's subsidiaries ply their wares to Buffett fans. Nearby, Dairy Queen is offering ice cream bars, and insurance giant Geico and private plane operator NetJets also have booths. But Fruit of the Loom's is by far the most popular. Shareholders can buy underwear there for as little as $6. \"The price is right,\" said Mike Hebel, a 74-year-old man from San Francisco who has been a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder for 25 years. \"I can get underwear here for about a third of the prices I find in San Francisco.\" John Shivel, vice president of corporate events at Fruit of the Loom, told CNBC the company has \"no idea\" how many people stop by the exhibit every year, but noted they have devised a system in which the line moves quickly \"and people can shop.\" To be sure, the exhibit also sells sporting goods from its Spalding brand, including basketballs and hoops. It also sells bags and shirts. Berkshire Hathaway bought Fruit of the Loom for $835 million nearly 20 years ago. However, the underwear company has been mired by declining earnings recently. In late 2017, Fruit of the Loom announced it was launching a subscription service in which customers can order garments for 30 percent less. show chapters The most surprising facts about Warren Buffett before he became a billionaire 4:55 PM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 | 01:34 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/04/105186354-Unknown.jpg?v=1525621623", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Fred Imbert"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Loom"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Omaha"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "NE"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 4th, 2018"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Omaha"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Neb."}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "Tens of thousands"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Midwestern"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "annual"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "annual"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "5"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Carol Anglen"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Omaha"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "20 years"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Anglen"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "hundreds"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Loom"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the CenturyLink Center"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Berkshire"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Dairy Queen"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Geico"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "NetJets"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Loom"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "as little as $6"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Mike Hebel"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "74-year"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "San Francisco"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Berkshire"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Hathaway"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "25 years"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about a third"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "San Francisco"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "John Shivel"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Fruit of the Loom"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Spalding"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Berkshire Hathaway bought Fruit"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Loom"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$835 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "nearly 20 years ago"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "late 2017"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Loom"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "30 percent"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "4:55 PM ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "4"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Berkshire Hathaway owns Fruit of the Loom as well as a slew of other businesses, including Geico and NetJets.

The bank's pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year fell to $4.755 billion from the $4.961 billion a year ago. At the same time, operating expenses were 13 percent higher at $9.4 billion. Its revenue for the quarter, meanwhile, climbed to $13.71 billion from $12.993 billion a year ago. The banking giant also said it is planning a share buyback of up to $2 billion \u2014 the only one it said it expects to conduct this year. Although some analysts had expected pre-tax profit to rise, the company pointed to higher costs in the first quarter in explaining the decline. \"We also made strategic hires in our securities joint venture in mainland China, and invested to enhance our digital capabilities in all our global businesses. This targeted spending contributed to a rise in adjusted costs in the first three months of the year,\" HSBC's group chief executive, John Flint, said in a statement. The bank's Hong Kong-listed shares, a heavyweight on the benchmark Hang Seng Index, fell 2.51 percent after the stock market resumed trading following a lunch break. Nevertheless, the first-quarter numbers still \"represent a good start for 2018 for HSBC,\" Iain Mackay, HSBC's group finance director, told CNBC's Sri Jegarajah after the release of the results. Getty Images \"We've got strong progression in terms of revenue across our four global businesses,\" he said. \"That's very much driven by our retail bank, wealth management businesses and our Asian business. So, pretty happy with where we started off the year.\" The bank had been expected by some analysts to continue its string of earnings growth seen over the last year. DBS Vickers' research director Ivan Li had expected the bank to report a 15 percent year-over-year jump in pre-tax profit for the first three months of 2018, helped by its wealth management business and higher interest rates in Hong Kong. \"I believe there are signs that their margins should be recovering, especially in Hong Kong due to the rising HIBOR these days,\" Li told CNBC's Bernie Lo on Friday ahead of the bank's results announcement. HIBOR, or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, is the benchmark interest rate in the city. The indicator tracks interest rates in the U.S. and has been climbing in recent months. HSBC, headquartered in London, is an Asia-focus bank and is one of the largest lenders in Hong Kong's mortgage market, Li noted. \"We'll be interested to see how much the Hong Kong interest rate will benefit them,\" he said. \"Its peer, Bank of China Hong Kong, has reported quite good quarterly figures end of last month, we expect HSBC to do the same or even a little bit better.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2012/12/11/100302337-hsbc_hq_getty.jpg?v=1519194288", "keywords": [{"category": "DATE", "term": "First quarter"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "4"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "4 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first quarter of 2018"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first three months of the year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$4.755 billion"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$4.961 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a year ago"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "13 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$9.4 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the quarter"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$13.71 billion"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$12.993 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a year ago"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "up to $2 billion"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "only one"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first quarter"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "China"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first three months of the year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "John Flint"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Hang Seng"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "2.51 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "first-quarter"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Iain Mackay, HSBC's"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Sri Jegarajah"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "four"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Asian"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "DBS Vickers'"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ivan Li"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "15 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year-over-year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first three months of 2018"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "these days"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Li"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bernie Lo"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "recent months"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "London"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Asia"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong's"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Li"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bank of China"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Hong Kong"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "quarterly"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last month"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}], "description": "HSBC's pre-tax profit for the first three months of 2018 fell to $4.755 billion from the $4.961 billion a year ago.

The surge in valuations, mostly seen throughout 2017, has made equities, bonds and currencies more expensive for those who want to invest in these categories. As a result, some money managers believe that the current market environment doesn't offer good opportunities and they would rather save their money to invest at a later stage. \"As we look across the vista of asset classes, whether you look at equities, bonds, currencies, most things look unattractive,\" Dan Kemp, chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management, told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe on Monday. \"It's a tough time to be an investor out there, particularly when you're looking long term,\" he said, adding that he would rather hold some cash. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Monday, Aug. 21, 2017. He's not the first to suggest such a course of action. In early March, a market strategist told CNBC that there was a new trend in markets: holding cash. At the time, Roger Jones, head of equities at London and Capital, told CNBC that higher interest rates would lead to lower returns on bonds going forward. If market players believe that yields are going to increase meaningfully, then they will avoid investing in bonds because the price moves inversely to the yield. In such situation, it is preferable to hold cash rather than invest into bonds and lose money. \"Cash is a slightly embarrassing thing to hold as an investment manager, (it) suggests you don't have a lot of ideas,\" Kemp said Monday, \"but there aren't a lot of good ideas.\" He added however that he sees some room for gains in U.S. health care companies and European telecoms.

In a response to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's ongoing inquiry into exchanges, the private company disclosed some key company data. Coinbase said it has doubled the size of its full-time engineering staff and has overhauled much of the the platform's code. \"These efforts and others have resulted in a 1000% increase in our surge, transaction capacity relative to Q3 of 2017,\" Coinbase said in a public version of the letter published this week. \"We expect to again double this capacity in coming months, all while maintaining the highest standard of security expected by our customers.\" The company's COO, Asiff Hirji, said serious demand for cryptocurrency and its core technology blockchain made that effort necessary. \"More people are starting to realize that this is foundational and you have the best and brightest in crypto running to build applications,\" Hirji told CNBC. \"If you believe that, It's not surprising to see ever increasing volumes and record transactions.\" Coinbase is also gearing up for more institutional money to enter the market, Hirji said, pointing to a New York Times report Thursday that Goldman Sachs is looking to start a bitcoin trading desk. In the letter, Coinbase said it has traded $150 billion in assets on the platform and it has received more than $225 million in funding. Personnel numbers were also disclosed, and the company has hired more than 300 full-time employees. When contractors are factored in, the company has 1,000 people working for Coinbase. Nearly 20 percent work in compliance, the company said. The company scaled quickly to keep up with demand last year as cryptocurrency trading skyrocketed. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 1,300 percent last year, nearing a high of $20,000 in December. As the company grew, some customers took to sites like Redddit to complain about site outages and customer support. Coinbase improved the amount of time the platform is fully functional, and operating smoothly known as \"uptime.\" \"We are proud to have delivered 99.97% uptime to users of the platform in the period January 1 to present, and 99.99% uptime in the month of April,\" Coinbase said. Coinbase reportedly valued itself at about $8 billion when it made an offer in a recent acquisition for Earn.com. The internal estimate is much higher than its last preferred valuation of $1.6 billion, Recode reported. Coinbase declined to comment on its valuation.

The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged Wednesday but acknowledged that inflation is beginning to creep higher. In a widely expected move, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee held the funds rate at a target of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. However, there were several tweaks to the post-meeting statement that market participants likely will find instructive. Markets that already were anticipating that the Fed would move to a more aggressive posture this year got more to chew on. Perhaps most significantly, the committee noted that \"overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent.\" That was an upgrade from the March meeting in which the FOMC said the indicators \"have continued to run below 2 percent.\" The change is key as Fed officials consider 2 percent to be a healthy level of inflation and a key for continuing to push rates higher. Stocks edged higher after the announcement. \"I give them credit. They didn't change a whole lot and they didn't need to,\" said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americans at Natixis. \"The equity market is really going to dictate how they're going to be able to raise rates.\" Markets have been watching the central bank for clues as to how aggressive it will be this year. Expectations heading into the meeting were for a total of three rate hikes, with a fourth given a nearly 50 percent chance. Inflation goal progress The committee made one other change to its inflation forecast. \"Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,\" the statement said. In March, the committee projected inflation to \"move up in coming months,\" so this week's language indicates more progress toward the inflation goal. The observation comes as the Fed's critical data point, the core personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 1.9 percent in March, the highest since February 2017. Including food and energy prices, the PCE level rose 2 percent. However, officials did hedge a bit regarding inflation. \"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low,\" a nod to the continued plodding pace of wage gains that has bedeviled policymakers since the Fed adopted its ultra-accommodative stance during the financial crisis in 2008. Average hourly earnings have remained below 3 percent throughout the economic recovery, most recently registering around 2.7 percent, even as the unemployment rate has plunged to 4.1 percent. An economic model called the Phillips curve to which Fed officials adhere indicates that wage pressures should increase as unemployment decreases, but that has not been the case yet. Business investment Fed officials did note some improvements in the economy. In particular, the statement pointed out that \"business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.\" In March, the committee said the metric had \"moderated\" from a strong fourth quarter. In describing risks to their economic forecasts, which are \"roughly balanced,\" officials changed the outlook from the \"near term\" to the \"medium term.\" Corporate earnings, which have been robust from the first quarter, have indicated companies expect to increase fixed investment by more than 20 percent. Profits likely rose more than 23 percent in the first three months and are expected to continue to climb through the year. The stock market has reacted little, though, with most of the major averages hovering around unchanged for the year. The economic picture overall is beginning to brighten. Though GDP rose just 2.3 percent in the first quarter, economists foresee a significant pickup through the year. The Atlanta Fed is projecting second-quarter growth of 4.1 percent, and the New York Fed predicts that first-quarter growth could get revised higher in subsequent readings. The committee approved the decision to hold rates steady unanimously, though it has publicly disagreed about how aggressive the path forward should be. Multiple officials are scheduled to speak publicly in the coming days.

Bitcoin has a fixed supply, so, when demand for it rises, bitcoin's price goes up, and the opposite is true when demand drops. The cryptocurrency project, called Basis, aims to keep a stable value around $1 by increasing and shrinking supply, the company's founder told CNBC Friday. \"It does it in a way that's actually analogous to how central banks grow and shrink the money supply to also maintain price stability,\" Nader Al-Naji, Basis co-founder and CEO, told CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"What we're trying to do is make cryptocurrency useful.\" Bitcoin prices fluctuated dramatically in the past 12 months, and have fallen by roughly 50 percent since their high near $20,000 in December, according to CoinDesk. That volatility has made it impossible to do things like pay salaries in bitcoin, said Al-Naji. \"If the price goes down, you're going to miss rent because that one bitcoin isn't worth very much,\" he said. \"If it goes up your employer is also going to be upset because he feels you're being paid too much.\" Al-Naji quit his job as an engineer at Google last year to found Basis with fellow Princeton graduates Lawrence Dio and Josh Chen. Bain Capital Ventures led the $133 million private placement, which was the firm's first purchase of cryptocurrency tokens. Other investors in Basis included Alphabet's GV venture capital arm and Andreessen Horowitz. Druckenmiller and Warsh have both bashed bitcoin for recent volatility. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Nader Al-Naji, CEO of Basis Druckenmiller told CNBC in December that bitcoin cannot be a medium of exchange \"because you can't do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility,\" adding that he didn't own any of the cryptocurrency. Warsh said in a March Wall Street Journal opinion piece that cryptocurrency \"price volatility significantly diminishes its usefulness as a reliable unit of account or an effective means of payment.\" \"But a new generation of cryptocurrencies is on the horizon, some of which might possess more of the attributes of money, better satisfying bitcoin's founding purpose,\" Warsh wrote.

To change the perception, they're looking to raise the bar on what he calls a lack of quality research on the short-side. Among the companies he's short is Tootsie Roll Industries, which represents a \"classic short\" with declining sales and earnings, and rising business costs. \"It's a product that resonated with our grandparents and not with the current generation,\" Axler said. \"Candy has come under fire for being unhealthy, dentists don't recommend it, there's no analysts that cover it.\" Tootsie Roll did not immediately return a call for comment.

A bank that had been under federal investigation until last year has played a role in two recent real estate transactions involving Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner's family company. Earlier this month, BofI Federal took over a mortgage previously owned by the Kushner Companies for a development in Brooklyn, New York City real estate filings show. The previously unreported transaction involves a loan on a development project in the historically industrial, now gentrifying Bushwick neighborhood. Kushner Companies had made a loan of roughly $30 million to the project at 215 Moore Street in late 2016. Jared Kushner remains a senior adviser to President Donald Trump. BofI, which was previously known as Bank of Internet USA, said in a statement to ProPublica that it \"has no exposure or relationship with Mr. Kushner or his company with respect to 215 Moore St.\" The bank likened the transaction to a routine refinancing. More from ProPublica: FBI's violent crime database to get financial boost from justice department The $3 million research breakdown Covering West Virginia's long history of broken promises In another transaction last October, the Kushner Companies got a $57 million loan on one of its own projects in New Jersey. BofI Federal provided much of the money behind that loan, Bloomberg reported last week. BofI Federal Bank faced a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its lending practices and conflict of interest policies until last year. After multiple subpoenas in 2016, the SEC closed the investigation in late June 2017. Kushner stepped away from the management of his family real estate company to join the Trump White House but held onto many of his family company's assets, including the Bushwick project debt. Ethics experts have criticized the arrangement, saying it could create conflicts of interest if Kushner Companies business partners have business before the government. Based in San Diego, the publicly traded BofI Federal does most of its real estate lending in California, and has only a small presence in the New York market. It has attracted attention from short-selling investors, who question the bank's business model and practices. The company has said the investors have purveyed misleading information. In November 2016, shortly after the presidential election, Kushner Companies announced it was pursuing a new line of business in lending money to other developers' projects. That month, the company made a loan of at least $33 million to a well-known New York developer, Toby Moskovits, for a project in Brooklyn. The developers have dubbed the project at 215 Moore Street and several adjacent lots the \"Bushwick Generator.\" The project is targeting what they describe as \"the job-generating tech and creative firms that are repowering Brooklyn's economy.\" On a recent visit, the project was still under construction. Most of the rundown former industrial building was still open to the sky, except for a central open-plan office area where a vintage Singer sewing machine table acts as a front desk. In a transaction inked in early April, the Kushner Companies debt was transferred to BofI, which is now the lender on the project, real estate filings show. Public records don't reveal the terms of the BofI transaction and whether Kushner Companies made money or otherwise benefitted. In a statement, BofI said that it had no relationship with Kushner regarding the Bushwick property. The bank said the owner of the Bushwick project was a pre-existing customer. BofI \"decided, after carefully underwriting the transaction, to provide financing to one of our prior customers,\" the bank said in a statement. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the owners of the project exited from the loan and \"repaid the Kushner lending arm.\" She declined to elaborate on the terms. BofI also played a role in an earlier Kushner Companies transaction in Jersey City, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Bloomberg reported that BofI provided much of the money for a $57 million October 2017 loan to the One Journal Square development. The Jersey City loan was issued by Fortress Investment Group and BofI purchased an interest in the loan from Fortress. In its statement, BofI said the terms of that deal are confidential. \"Banks routinely purchase participation interests in loans made by other institutional investors,\" the statement said. In the hunt for funding for the same Jersey City project, Kushner's sister drew negative attention last year when she pitched Chinese investors using a controversial program that gives visas to foreigners who invest in the U.S. The SEC investigation of BofI was closed without any action on June 27, 2017, several months before the first of the known Kushner transactions, according to documents obtained through public records requests by investment research outfit Probes Reporter. As part of its investigation, the SEC subpoenaed documents from BofI relating to its internal controls, conflicts of interest policies, and residential loans to foreigners, among other matters. The New York Post reported early last year that the Justice Department was also looking into issues at the bank related to possible money laundering. \"We are not aware of any ongoing DOJ or Treasury investigation,\" the company said in a statement. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Decca Muldowney contributed reporting.

Celebrating \"the end of history\" and trying to \"manage\" China's unstoppable ascent, America, with very little help from Europe, has been on a crucial mission to defend and reinforce the centuries-old system of Western governance based on democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights. In the process, inadequate attention to U.S. foreign trade accounts and errors of economic policy have made that mission increasingly difficult. The resulting losses of wealth and proprietary technology, and an enormous accumulation of domestic and foreign debt, have led to tides of fury and ebbs of thoughtful introspection about America's role in the world. Watching the pictures and reading the reports of last week's trade negotiations with China shows how far America has gone in the neglect of its vital interests. It would have been hard to imagine only a few years ago that Washington would be sending envoys to tell Beijing that its excessive $375 billion surplus on American trades could no longer be tolerated. Hard indeed, especially since Washington did not need to do that. A deal Xi could not refuse One of the first orders of business for President Donald Trump should have been to tell China's President Xi Jinping that he would like him to quickly bring down that exorbitant surplus \u2014 and to follow that up with balanced bilateral trade accounts. That would have been in full compliance with G-20 recommendations for a balanced and stable world economy, and would have also conformed to China's proclaimed commitment to \"win-win cooperation.\" Such a talk would be an easy conversation to test what Trump calls his \"great relationship\" with China's core leader. Xi is the only person in China who can fix the trade problem as simply and quickly as he brought about a spectacular change in world's war and peace conditions on the Korean Peninsula. Xi's trade negotiators are acting on his direct orders, and nothing will be done until Xi puts on it his imprimatur. Had Trump done a deal that Xi could not refuse \u2014 while continuing his crusade for globalization, multilateralism and a \"win-win\" business \u2014 the negotiating teams would have only had to decide how to increase American sales to China and how to cut China's exports to the U.S. They'd be working with specific numbers and time limits to implement their leaders' agreement. Trump, unfortunately, missed a chance to do that. He has now embarked the U.S. on a never-ending negotiating rigmarole that will lead to a serious \u2014 and very dangerous \u2014 confrontation with China. Trump can now expect increasing difficulties in his relationship with a Chinese leader who is successfully edging American influence out in many areas of Asia and beyond. Just as the U.S. trade team was getting ready to leave Beijing last Friday, Xi was working the phones with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. According to media reports, Xi, who made the recent inter-Korean summit possible, assured Moon of China's support for peace and cooperation. Moon, of course, needed no convincing from a Chinese leader who is taking more than a quarter of South Korean exports, and who hosts large investments and local production of Korean chaebols. Work with Germany for a quick EU trade accord A much more important phone call was the first-ever such contact last Friday between Xi and Abe \u2014 a crowning achievement for Abe's long years of patient and persistent pursuit of dialog with the Chinese leader. Even with Xi's mandatory reminder that Japan should \"remember history and draw proper conclusions,\" Abe now knows that China's huge and rapidly expanding market is opening wider to Japanese trade and investments. Beijing says it is \"ready to press the reset button with Tokyo,\" Abe is expected to come to China this year to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and Xi's visit to Japan is planned for next year. And while the U.S. was announcing that \"there will be consequences\" to China's military installations on contested islands in the South China Sea, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was saying that relations with China will \"bloom ... like a big and beautiful flower,\" while thanking China for helping his \"Build, Build, Build\" infrastructure program. Vietnam, another supposed \"opponent\" to China's expansion, is currently working to \"lift the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership\" with Beijing to a new level by aligning its \"Two Corridors and One Economic Circle\" development program with \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure projects. Indonesia, where China remains the largest trade partner, is making similar efforts to upgrade its infrastructure with the help of Chinese investments and financial assistance to build power plants, roads, bridges and high-speed rail lines. Those are some of the most prominent examples of deeply entrenched and rapidly expanding China ties in East Asia. One could also add to that list Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. It is easy to understand why all these countries openly, or tacitly, support China in its trade standoff with the U.S. And that sympathy for China will probably keep increasing as the hostile rhetoric and obstacles to trade flows continue to escalate. But the most regrettable and strident accusations of American \"trade protectionism\" come from the European Union. For Washington, that was one trade fight too many. A total miscalculation and a masterclass of how one converts an eminently valid and relatively minor trade complaint with friendly allies into a devastating liability. Investment thoughts America's shockingly huge and systematic trade deficits with China are a political issue of the highest order. Trump should have dealt with that directly with his Chinese counterpart to set the principle, and the schedule, for the rebalancing of bilateral trade accounts. Instead of that, Trump has allowed the issue to slip into the meanders of interminable nitpicking. Two things could be done now. One, an urgent Trump-Xi meeting to get the trade issue back to the level where it belongs. No tweets. Only a respectful, forceful and friendly call for squaring the trade accounts, with the appointment of working parties to implement the agreement within a clearly defined timeframe. Two, get \u2014 as quickly as possible \u2014 an example-setting trade accord with the EU. Germany says it is ready and eager to do that to guarantee the stability and predictability of the EU's trade relations with the U.S. America and the EU need each other to safeguard the system of free and fair international trade they built together. That system is the foundation of free market economies based on democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights. Put briefly, that is the West's world order \u2014 Pax Americana \u2014 that is now being defended from, what Washington calls, \"revisionist powers\" espousing very different principles of statecraft, and very different societal forms and values.

buybacks may be on the rise, but noted analyst Dick Bove warned that is something banks shouldn't be doing. \"I am a big believer that buying back stock is a horrible thing to do for a bank. It's like an oil company giving away oil for stock. You don't do it. You don't give away capital for stock either if you are a bank,\" the chief strategist at Hilton Capital Management said on \"Closing Bell\" Friday. Public companies are expected to return more money to shareholders this year in the form of stock buybacks and dividend increases. Through the end of April, S&P 500 companies are on track to give back a record $1 trillion to investors, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. After passing the Federal Reserve stress tests last June, several big banks announced plans to buy back more of their stock. Bove said the theory is since the big banks can't grow larger, they can give away capital. \"I don't believe that's true,\" he said. \"We're looking at a period where the need for money is going to grow exponentially at a time when the availability of money is declining.\" That's because there is now a \"massive change\" going on in the financial industry, he explained. \"For the last 20, 25 years if you wanted money it was there,\" Bove said. \"Now money supply is not growing. It's not growing because the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet.\" The Federal Reserve is now in the process of winding its $4.5 trillion portfolio, known as its balance sheet. It consists mostly of government debt accumulated in the years after the financial crisis. Overall, Bove is bullish on the banking sector, which has seen a strong first-quarter earnings season. \"The banks are entering a so-to-speak golden age in which they are going to be able to earn consistent increase in earnings, unless there's a recession,\" he said. \"If there's a recession, they're dead. Without that, I think the earnings are in a big upturn.\" He specifically likes the smaller-cap banks, which are \"just killing\" the big banks in terms of stock performance. In fact, from 2000 to 2017, mid-cap bank stocks were up 20 percent a year on average, while the biggest universal banks were down, Bove said. \"There's no comparison whatsoever.\" His top picks include Silicon Valley Bank, which he calls a \"huge winner,\" and Pinnacle Financial. \u2014 CNBC's Fred Imbert and Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Argentina's peso rebounded from a record low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday following a report the Latin American nation could get a credit line from the International Monetary Fund. Bloomberg News reported that Latin America's third-largest economy could get a $30 billion loan from the IMF. The report \u2014 citing a person with direct knowledge on the matter \u2014 said that Argentine President Mauricio Macri reached out to the IMF after the peso began to free-fall, affecting other financial markets in the country. The Financial Times and Reuters also reported that Argentina is seeking a credit line. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement on Tuesday that \"discussions have been initiated on how we can work together to strengthen the Argentine economy and these will be pursued in short order.\" Lagarde also said: \"I very much welcome President Macri's statement today and look forward to our continuing partnership with Argentina.\" show chapters Higher volatility creating opportunities in Argentina, analyst says 2:55 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 02:47 The peso traded at 22.4 against the dollar, down about 2 percent, after falling to an all-time low of 23.1. But for the year, the peso is down more than 20 percent against the greenback despite Argentina sporting the highest overnight interest rates in the world. On Friday, Argentina's central bank hiked rates for the third time in eight days to a whopping 40 percent as it tries to reign in the country's rampant inflation. In March, consumer prices in Argentina rose 2.3 percent, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 25.4 percent, well above the central bank's 15 percent target. \"Argentina is in a dilemma,\" wrote Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin America global markets strategy at BNP Paribas, in a note on April 26. If the central bank \"hikes the way it should, the fiscal deficit will increase. \u2026 If the monetary authority decides to do nothing and manage expectations through the FX rate, the damage will be done via higher risk premium in the credit spreads of Argentina (lower reserves and higher depreciation expectations).\" The peso's sharp drop also dragged Argentine stocks lower. The Merval index pulled back as much as 5.4 percent before closing 4.2 percent lower. \"There is no silver bullet for managing Argentina's long-standing and conflicting economic and political challenges,\" Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Exotix Capital, said in a note. After years of populism and protectionist policies, \"the adjustment is painful and there is no way to keep all of Argentina's economic metrics heading in the right direction,\" Malik said. \"It is this prognosis that has driven our caution on Argentina equities.\" \u2014CNBC's J.R.

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, makes and sells everything from bricks and batteries to cowboy boots, underwear and Ginsu knives. To illustrate how intertwined the company is with American life, Berkshire subsidiaries sell and build homes, produce insulation, flooring, paint and furnishings. They even stock the pantries and closets \u2014 and clothe the occupants. In addition, Berkshire entities distribute food and other items to groceries, truck stops and convenience stores; produce the ingredients for baby shampoo and other household goods; and insure millions of drivers and deliver regional news. show chapters Warren Buffett on missing out on Amazon and Google 5:16 PM ET Mon, 7 May 2018 | 02:01 With more than 360,000 workers in operations as vast as manufacturing, retail, insurance, financial services, railroads and energy, Berkshire subsidiaries produce the components, goods and services that help drive the engine of American commerce. This gives Buffett a unique view on the health of the American economy, which he has said is growing more quickly than in the recent past. He recently told CNBC that business activity is \"stronger than it's been. It's been improving year after year after the financial panic [of 2008].\" He has talked about the ways American ingenuity and resourcefulness have improved the lives of the middle class. Those improvements have given them options in education, medicine, travel and entertainment that weren't accessible but by the very rich only a couple of generations ago. \"We've got something that works,\" he said in a Fortune interview last year. \"I believe, and I think this has been borne out over 240 years, that this country gets better all the time.\" \"If America did well, American business would do well.\" -Warren Buffett, billionaire investor Much of this optimism is put on display at the Omaha company's annual meeting, including a vast exhibit hall where Buffett holds court each year, often with a Dairy Queen product in hand. Shareholders are invited to shop the booths at the convention center, but also around town for candy at See's, jewelry at Borsheims and furniture at Nebraska Furniture Mart. Buffett's investing advice sticks close to home \u2014 something he said he learned as a boy growing up during World War II. \"All you had to do was figure that America was going to do well over time, and if America did well, American business would do well,\" he told shareholders at Saturday's annual meeting. \"You didn't have to pick winning stocks. You basically had to make one investment decision in your life.\" For Buffett, one decision he made in 1964 would catapult him to fame. He found a beaten down textile maker with a stock so cheap it seemed like a safe bet to buy. His plan was to tender it back to the management for a profit. He thought he had a deal with them, but then management tried to extract a tiny bit more than he was willing to give \u2014 making him mad enough to buy the rest of the company. That's how he ended up with Berkshire Hathaway, a fading manufacturing business that would become the basis of a far-reaching conglomerate with a market capitalization of $486 billion (making it the sixth-largest stock) and a compounded annual gain since then of 19.1 percent. Berkshire shares have skyrocketed, from less than $10 per share back then, to $292,600. David A. Grogan | CNBC The Coca-Cola booth at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder's Meeting in Omaha, NE, on May 5, 2018. Over the years, Berkshire has rolled up leading positions in a myriad of sectors across its 63 operating subsidiaries. In 2009, in its biggest deal yet, it acquired the rest of Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad it didn't already own, the second-largest freight line in the U.S. It also took on Geico, now the second-largest auto insurer. It also owns nearly one-third of packaged food giant Kraft Heinz. Buffett has also ridden to the rescue more than once, injecting money into Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and General Electric to help them navigate the financial crisis. The billionaire also took on an active role in managing Salomon Brothers in the late 1980s, after a scandal involving rigged Treasury bond auctions. The company's $170 billion portfolio of stock holdings doubles down on Buffett's America-focused bet, specifically on consumers, whose spending makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Berkshire holds large stakes of lenders (like M&T Bank), household product makers (such as Gillette), food and beverage companies, communications and travel providers and the quintessential American gadget maker, Apple. Its five biggest holdings are Wells Fargo and Bank of America, Apple, Coca-Cola and American Express. Over his career, Buffett developed his buy-and-hold investment style inspired by Benjamin Graham. Berkshire's longest-held stock investment is American Express, which it began buying in the 1960s, building up to a 17 percent stake currently.

Of the 497 CFOs across 30 countries surveyed by Zurich Insurance Group, EY and the Atlantic Council, 71 percent expected continued improvement in the U.S. business environment over the next three years, while 61 percent \"felt confident or extremely confident about investing in the U.S.\" This is despite rising calls for protectionism and the renegotiation of long-established trade arrangements by President Donald Trump's administration. A decade after the financial crisis, corporate players cited global economic recovery, domestic tax reform and deregulation as core factors contributing to the strong sentiment gauged in the report, entitled \"Borders vs Barriers: Navigating uncertainty in the U.S. business environment.\" The respondents came from all industry sectors in foreign and domestic companies, and roughly half had investments in the U.S. \"A majority \u2014 68 percent \u2014 of CFOs say U.S. tax reform will have a positive impact on their bottom line,\" the report said. About half of companies benefiting from tax savings said they would use them to re-invest in plants and equipment, while almost two-thirds of those with U.S. employees said they planned to increase their headcount over the next six months. Isolationism concerns But despite their optimism, the investors still had concerns about how U.S. policy could affect their business prospects \u2014 particularly any measures that restrict the flow of goods, capital and people. Trump's motions toward a trade war and crackdown on immigration are among their worries. Sixty-eight percent of CFOs surveyed expected U.S. protectionism to grow in the next one-to-three years, with \"46 percent indicating this growth would negatively impact investment,\" the report said. Sixty-three percent predicted harsher scrutiny of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and 68 percent expected more restrictive immigration policies, with 42 percent of those predicting these would negatively affect investment. show chapters Warren Buffett on the US economy 4:15 PM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 | 02:20 Zurich's economic modeling calculated that over the next five years, isolationism could result in a 30 percent drop in trade and a potential cumulative loss of $2 trillion in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and 1.7 million American jobs when compared to an \"internationalist\" market scenario. \"The improved short-term economic outlook appears to be prompting CFOs to be overwhelmingly optimistic,\" said George Quinn, group chief financial officer at Zurich. \"At the same time, many CFOs doing business in the U.S. have never experienced an economic downturn, and the world is more uncertain due to a number of recent geopolitical events.\" Around two-thirds of CFOs also expected to see an increase in cyber threats to the U.S. and faster rates of innovation in competitor countries. A rosy outlook, but for how long? The respondents' enduring confidence in America's business environment has been reflected in strong market gains and company earnings in recent months. But others in the business world worry that the booming recovery of the world's largest economy may not be long-lived. A recent survey by J.P. Morgan found that 75 percent of ultra-high net worth investors forecast a U.S. recession in the next two years, while some economists warned that U.S. growth would not keep pace with its fast-mounting budget deficit, on track to top $1 trillion by 2020. Even billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates said recently that another recession like that of 2008 was \"a certainty.\" Still, plenty of market players will tell you there's no reason for concern and that the economy will continue moving full-speed ahead. The bottom line is that there is little consensus except that the current picture looks good. America is enjoying its lowest unemployment in 17 years, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently upped its U.S. growth forecast for 2018 to 2.9 percent. About half of the CFOs surveyed in the report represented firms with over $500 million in yearly revenue, and a quarter made more than $3 billion in revenue.

Moves by the Fed and other major central banks to raise interest rates after a long period of keeping them low should not be disruptive to the global economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday. In remarks prepared for a financial conference in Zurich, Powell said that the role U.S. monetary policy plays in driving global financial conditions and capital flows is often exaggerated. The pickup in both global growth and commodity prices have played bigger roles in the recent recovery of capital flows to emerging market economies than any policy moves by central banks, he said. \"Monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced economies played a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to (emerging market economies) in recent years,\" Powell said. \"There is good reason to think the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies should continue to prove manageable for\" emerging economies. After keeping its benchmark interest rate at a record low near zero for seven years following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed began gradually increasing the rate in December 2015. It made a sixth quarter-point move in March. Many private economists believe the Fed will raise rates again in June and will hike rates a total of three or four times this year. In his remarks, Powell said he did not dismiss the risks as the Fed, the European Central Bank and other major central banks raise rates. \"Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate,\" he said. \"And, of course, future economic conditions may surprise us, as they often do.\" But he stressed that the Fed planned to do what it could to minimize disruptions by communicating policy changes clearly and well in advance. In 2013, remarks by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke triggered what was dubbed a \"taper tantrum.\" Investors feared that the U.S. central bank would start trimming or \"tapering\" its program of buying bonds sooner than expected and U.S. bond rates temporarily surged, sending shock waves through a number of emerging-market economies. The Fed was using its bond purchases to hold down long-term interest rates. Bernanke and other Fed officials realized they had botched the communication of future Fed moves and since that time, Fed officials have been more cautious when commenting about future moves. In his remarks Tuesday, Powell indicated the Fed would seek to avoid repeating the 2013 mistake. \"We will communicate our policy strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid market disruptions,\" he said.

The currency on Monday hit its lowest in 15 months to trade at 67.13 rupees against a dollar \u2014 that's a 5.15 percent fall for the year so far.

India is a net importer of oil and every $10 per barrel increase in price could worsen its current account and fiscal balances by 0.4 percent and 0.1 percent of GDP, respectively, Nomura analysts estimated. That could shave around 15 basis points off the country's growth, the analysts wrote in a note. \"Rupee is no longer in that sweet spot\" -Maybank analysts A weaker rupee and higher oil prices will cause inflation to accelerate, which may prompt the Reserve Bank of India to hike interest rates earlier than expected, the analysts said.

India saw a net outflow of $244.44 million by the end of April this year, reversing the $30.78 billion of net buying for 2017, according to the data.

While cross-border volumes grew by 19 percent, that number dropped by 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter, in part because fewer people bought digital currencies like bitcoin with their credit cards. \"This is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding,\" Mastercard chief financial officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on the earnings call Wednesday. \"We expect cross-border growth to moderate somewhat.\" Customers can use Mastercard to buy in and out of cryptocurrencies, and store them into what's known as \"crypto wallet.\" But some banks have prohibited the practice. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are among those that banned credit card purchases for digital currency in February, citing price volatility and potential credit risks. Mastercard's CEO pointed to uncertainty in Asia, and said some exchanges are pulling back in South Korea, while others in Japan are worried about security. show chapters Don't worry about a crackdown, just keep betting on bitcoin: Technician 8:04 PM ET Tue, 1 May 2018 | 03:52 \"There's a lot of concerns even in Japan because one of their biggest exchanges got hacked,\" Ajay Banga, president and CEO of Mastercard said on the call. \"As you can see, right now there's a little less interest than there was in the latter part of the fourth quarter and the first quarter.\" In December, bitcoin rose to nearly $20,000 after starting the year below $1,000. Its 1,300 percent rise in 2017 was followed by a sharp correction this year. The cryptocurrency lost nearly half of its value in the first three months of 2018, according to data from CoinDesk. Mastercard's CEO made it clear on the call that cryptocurrency is not a major part of corporate strategy because of its unpredictability. \"This is not something we count on because we just don't know how to predict it or we don't even want to count it,\" Banga said. While the cryptocurrency factor is \"interesting,\" it's also not a key factor for Mastercard's value, said James Friedman, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. \"It's their job to transact anywhere that the consumer or merchant carries their card, and cryptocurrencies is the place it's showing up,\" Friedman said. \"But I don't think it's relevant to the Mastercard investment thesis, we won't penalize them for it.\" Shares of Mastercard charged more than 3 percent higher Wednesday after the company reported first-quarter profit and revenue that beat Wall Street analysts' expectations.

On Friday, the index surged following an encouraging April jobs report. Both the Dow and S&P 500 Indexes saw their best daily performance since April 10, but still ended the week marginally lower. However, according to Harvey, investors should soon start seeing fewer declines. He told CNBC that a sustainable move higher is in the cards. \"I'm not a real positive guy, but I'm starting to turn more positive. We're starting to see good things across the marketplace. Value is being uncovered,\" the firm's head of equity strategy said recently on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" His latest assessment came as the Dow fell back into correction territory last week for the third time this year \u2014 but it didn't stay there. \"The bounce could be a few weeks away. We don't think we are any more than two months away,\" said Harvey, noting that's when second quarter earnings season kicks off. Harvey sees strong earnings reports ultimately pulling the market out of its rut. He characterized 2018's violent market sell-offs as \"classic textbook\" in a Federal Reserve tightening cycle. \"When the Fed tightens, you usually see the curve flatten. When the curve flattens, you have a price adjustment. The price adjustment in the equity market is 5 to 10 percent,\" he added. Harvey's S&P 500 year-end target is 2950 \u2014 a 10 percent gain from its current levels. He views this environment as a buying opportunity, and added that he's partial to technology and financials.

The cryptocurrency industry is getting so hot that dedicated career services are popping up. On Thursday, CoinDesk, a leading source of cryptocurrency news and organizer of major industry conferences, launched an online \"Career Center\" with job listings. It's \"no secret demand for blockchain skills is high and that finding talent is a real difficulty,\" Jacob Donnelly, director of marketing, said in a statement. CoinDesk is also hosting a career fair along with its Consensus conference in New York this month. Listings of \"blockchain\" skills skyrocketed more than 6,000 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, online freelancing database Upwork said in a report Tuesday. That's far and away the hottest skill on Upwork, and a slight change from the fourth quarter when \"bitcoin\" was the fastest-growing skill and blockchain wasn't even on the list. \"There's an explosion of activity around cryptocurrencies because of that extremely volatile, but extremely exciting, nature of bitcoin. There's a lot of millionaires made overnight and drawn a lot of people in,\" said Andy Challenger, vice president at placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. \"There's sort of a gold rush mentality.\" Bitcoin grabbed public attention last year when the price of one coin shot up more than 2,000 percent in 12 months to above $19,000. The cryptocurrency was the first application of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a permanent, secure record of transactions between two parties. Now, start-ups and corporations alike are testing ways to use blockchain in a host of areas such as energy distribution and supply chain management. Last year, IBM, Microsoft and Accenture accounted for roughly half of $700 million in global revenues related to blockchain, according to Oppenheimer analysts Shaul Eyal and Tanner Hoban. They noted estimates that the size of the blockchain industry could grow into the tens of billions. \"As the technology matures, we think those blockchain engineers will see absolutely high demand,\" Eyal said in a phone interview. \"Right now it's a little bit of a wild, Wild West with many entrepreneurs trying to jockey for position.\" Some analysts say taking the risk in a cryptocurrency role could position someone for a key role in a major corporation down the road. \"If you enter the crypto start-up space and gain some experience in the underlying blockchain technology, it will serve you really well,\" Challenger said. \"It's an industry that requires a certain amount of expertise, and that's a rare commodity.\" The cryptocurrency industry is still small \u2014 the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies to date is about the size of one typical S&P 500 company, according to CoinMarketCap. And as with any nascent trend, the risks are high. Sometimes a start-up has a good idea, brings people to work on a prototype, but doesn't get funding, said David Gadd, director at tech recruiting firm Proxime Solutions. So the company has to close down. Still, the Canada-based recruiter said many people are coming out of government and insurance companies to work in blockchain and many financial institutions are also building up their own blockchain teams. Although \"no one wants to be seen as the first company to come out with a blockchain project, they have a team ready to go sitting on the bench,\" Gadd said.

China's leadership responded with tariff lists of its own, as the world's two largest economies escalated the threats in what became a tit-for-tat push to penalize many of each other's vital industries. The tariffs have yet to go into effect, and negotiations are currently underway although few signs of an agreement have emerged. The U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services reached $566 billion in 2017, a 12 percent increase on the previous year and the highest level since 2008. \"I think war is always no good, let's always try to avoid any wars,\" Yong said.

Trade tensions between the United States and China and the normalization of U.S. interest rates are the top concerns for developing Asia, government officials from across the region told CNBC this week. As U.S. and Chinese officials meet for trade talks in Beijing, Asia is watching negotiations closely for signs of mutual concessions that can help avert a tariff war. While retaliatory duties between the world's two largest economies are a global worry, they are especially alarming for Asia \u2014 a region where economic prosperity has been synonymous with exports and open markets. Any hit to China from a trade war is widely expected to affect the economic giant's trading partners. Speaking to CNBC at the Asian Development Bank's annual gathering in Manila this week, Philippine Secretary of Finance Carlos Dominguez said \"the potential trade war that is occurring, that might occur,\" was his primary risk. \"And also the ideas in some Western states that trade is not an engine for growth\u2026 That is a very big threat to us.\" Vongsey Vissoth, secretary of state at Cambodia's Ministry of Economy and Finance, said that if China's economy was to slow down, his country would certainly be impacted. \"China is a source of investment for Cambodia, it's also a source of tourism,\" he said. \"So, if something happens to China, it will happen to Cambodia also.\" President Donald Trump's tariffs on Beijing could have a spillover effect on Southeast Asia since the region is a significant contributor to Chinese exports that are headed stateside. Trade fears aside, \"the other thing that worries us is the normalization process\u2026 that might create a few shocks,\" Dominguez said, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. \"It is a disruptive factor,\" but one that the Philippine economy is fully prepared for, he said. Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati echoed those views.

Billionaire Li Ka-shing \u2014 one of the world's richest men \u2014 is set to retire on Thursday ahead of his 90th birthday later this year, capping a career as one of Asia's most storied businessmen and handing the reins of his corporate empire to his son. Known as Asia's \"superman,\" Li formally stepped down as chairman at the annual shareholders' meeting of CK Hutchison, his conglomerate with interests in real estate, telecommunications, shipping and retail. He was due to leave a similar position at property arm CK Asset Holdings later in the day at its meeting. The move had been flagged as long ago as 2012 and the date was formally announced in March. It comes as a number of Asia's family-run businesses face leadership transitions. \"It's been a long succession process,\" Joseph Fan, a professor of accountancy and finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" adding that it has actually been more than 30 years in the making. Li plans to stay on as a senior advisor, but his son, Victor Li, 53, will take over. And though the move has been widely telegraphed, analysts were still speculating on how the transition will play out given the size of the businesses. show chapters Discussing the succession plan at CK Hutchison 12:56 AM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 | 02:45 The conglomerate has more than 300,000 employees in some 50 countries around the world and is a dominant force in Hong Kong, where family-run businesses have led the city's economy for decades. The elder Li has controlled one of the world's largest operators of container terminals, Hutchison Port, and Asia's biggest health and beauty retailer, Watsons. Ronald Wan of Partners Financial Holdings said investors want to know where the younger Li will go in terms of investment policy. \"I think (the) market perception on Mr. Li Ka-shing and Mr. Victor Li is basically different,\" Wan told CNBC's Dan Murphy, adding that investors see the son as more conservative than his father. \"So basically, investors will be cautious to know how he is going to position the future investment policy,\" he said, adding there is particular interest on whether it will move more toward globalization and away from mainland China. The retiring Li, who rose from poverty in southern China's Guangdong province, started his rise by establishing a plastics company in 1950, which eventually listed on Hong Kong's stock exchange in 1972. His businesses were consolidated in 2015 into CK Hutchison for non-property ventures and CK Asset Holdings for property. Analysts were also paying attention to what kind of management personnel the younger Li will favor, with Fan saying the next five years will be important as he \"gradually introduces a younger generation of professional managers.\" Fan called the transition \"critically important,\" stressing that the continued presence of an older generation of managers was also crucial. \"That will help ensure the smooth transition from the previous to the next generation of professional management that is very, very important to the success of Victor Li,\" he said.

Germany does not want to finance the budget to support reforms in a French proposal to \"refound\" the European economic and political integration (aka \"the European project\"). At the same time, the presumption of European unity is being severely tested by the extraterritorial impact of President Donald Trump's unilateral sanctions on Iran. Ironically, the money is the least of the problems in a quasi-permanent state of unease in French-German relations. Against that background, displays of bonhomie on official occasions look like a polite gloss of convenience on a centuries-old hostility of neighbors living the illusion of harmony and cooperation. After a decade of taking a back seat to Germany in economic policy and European affairs, France is now moving center stage in denouncing what it calls the German \"fetishism of trade and budget surpluses\" at the expense of the rest of Europe and a wider world. France, correctly, sees these policies as a serious obstacle to its proposals to strengthen the European project. Predictably, Germany is stalling, while the hostility of the German media sounds like an intention to bring the young French upstart \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 down to the real world by showing him who's the boss. \"Don't be afraid,\" says Macron Paris, however, is neither fooled nor intimidated. The highly educated French president is no shrinking violet, as he showed in his frontal attack on Trump's policies during his address to the joint session of the U.S. Congress last month. He knows that his ideas about the future of Europe and the French-German relations are issues for serious debate. He also knows that Germany's peremptory dismissal of his reform proposals are signs of vulnerability because he is pressing the right buttons. Here is what's at stake. In several of his speeches last year, Macron proposed measures mostly focused on the 19-nation monetary union that should serve as a strong core of the European Union consisting of 28 member states (or 27 if the UK concludes the separation agreement by the spring 2019). Among the key proposals are a common euro area finance minister, a legislative and executive authority and a budget to finance the euro area's economic, social and fiscal convergence. Suffering from a protracted interregnum last year, Germany took all that as an affront. Macron's pIan was dead on arrival in Berlin, shot to pieces well in advance in a typical NIH (not invented here) manner. The whole thing was ridiculed as an exercise in building unnecessary bureaucracy and imposing new financial burdens. Berlin prefers to talk about its own priorities, such as the mandatory EU quotas for taking migrants that Germany invited and could no longer manage, digital economy and the completion of the euro area banking union. True to form, the German \"down-to-earth\" talk is also accompanied by the usual violins about staying competitive to push exports. Make no mistake, this French-German kabuki show is a deadly serious power play. As a well-informed analyst of the European political scene, Macron is moved by a number of fundamental factors underlying the future of the European project. Macron again: \"The time to act is now!\" One, his plan for a complete federal structure of the monetary and fiscal union is meant to guarantee the strength and the finality of the European project and its legal tender. Two, such a structure would be impossible to deconstruct by nationalists, populists and similar constituencies blaming all sorts of socio-economic problems on the EU's single market and the common currency. Three, I'll take the liberty of ascribing to Macron this unstated thought: His euro area reform program would also make it impossible for Germany to boss people around; the administrative setup he proposes would unfailingly and routinely enforce the rules of the monetary and fiscal union. The focus is now on the meeting of the European Council \u2014 a forum of EU heads of state and government \u2014 on June 28-29, where France and Germany are supposed to present a joint \"road map\" of European reforms. French commentators of all stripes expect a damp squib, accusing Macron of talking too much instead of \"banging his fist on the table.\" Responding to that criticism, the French presidency announced last week that it was looking for substantive decisions next month. Wish them luck, because Germany does not seem ready for substantive decisions on anything. In her speech last week to celebrate Macron's Charlemagne Prize (for contributions to the cause of the European Union), German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke mainly of the problems the U.S. was creating for the German economy with its unilateral sanctions on Iran. Macron, in her words, was \"bubbling with ideas,\" but said nothing about Germany's response, or what Germany was prepared to do to help \"Europe take its destiny in its own hands.\" The reaction to the fallout from Washington's Iran sanctions is characteristic of ambiguity in French-German relations. In spite of statements that the two countries wanted to stay in Iran's nuclear agreement, Paris and Berlin are working on separate tracks to get exemptions from the U.S.-imposed sanctions on their companies involved in multi-year and multi-billion deals with Tehran. France says that the extraterritorial reach of Trump's Iran sanctions is \"unacceptable,\" while Germany remains resigned that \"nothing can be done about it.\" Following that conclusion, Germany is talking about post-Trump policies, because Berlin presumably expects that next November's mid-term Congressional elections can cripple what they apparently believe will be a one-term presidency. More realistically, Germany seems to be counting on China and Russia (and perhaps India) to reject Washington's unilateral sanctions on Iran \u2014 offering a way out the German-led Europe is unable to find on its own. All eyes are now on Iran's ongoing talks in Beijing and Moscow, and a visit of Tehran's delegation to Brussels next Tuesday. Investment thoughts Investors voting with their savings on euro-denominated assets may wish to follow closely the French-German clash about measures that are necessary to strengthen the European project. These are crucially important steps to make irrevocable the EU's single market and the euro as a legal tender. France has posed that question in the form of far-reaching reforms to mend Europe's dangerous fault lines and set the famously fractious continent on a path to peace, harmony and prosperity. So far, Germany has shown no interest to cooperate, but France, apparently, won't give up. A prominent French philosopher reminded the body politic last week that \"article one of Macronist doctrine is attachment to the idea of a united Europe.\" Trump has made this intra-European discord more difficult with extraterritorial economic and financial implications of his wide-ranging sanctions. By withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, and threatening sanctions on any company working with Iranian counterparts, Trump could potentially tear up the fragile European project. I am not betting on that, but those who argue that Trump's disruptions could achieve the opposite result ignore deeply entrenched divisions and outright hostilities plaguing what people still hopefully call the European Union. You want to take a bet? Here is mine: Macron will win and Italy will soon get a pro-European prime minister with little patience for Germany. The fiercely independent and highly professional European Central Bank will remain a pillar of the steadily growing euro area economy. Trump will be \"convinced\" by China, Russia and India \u2014 all actively trading with Tehran as an ally \u2014 to scale back his Iranian hostilities.

2018 | 00:49 Apple and Goldman Sachs are planning a new credit card to be introduced as early as next year, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people with knowledge of the process. The move comes as investment bank Goldman continues to make a push into consumer banking activities such as deposit-taking and personal loans. It will displace London-based Barclays as Apple's financial partner for credit cards, the Journal said. The card will be branded with Apple Pay, the technology giant's mobile payment and digital wallet platform. The move could address priorities for both companies. Apple is looking to boost revenue from things other than gadgets, and the payments space is in the midst of intense competition from banks and tech startups. Goldman is looking to diversify its revenue away from institutional areas like trading and investment banking with its push into areas of finance that touch ordinary consumers. The partnership could also include Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers for the tech company's products, the Journal said.

The nation's largest banks \u2014 and public companies, for that matter \u2014 are preparing for a timeout from the courtroom following years of being pummeled by shareholder and investor lawsuits in the wake of the Great Recession. At the end of 2017, the country's largest banks collectively decreased their estimates for future legal costs to their lowest levels since 2012, and legal experts predict the move is a harbinger of what's to come for Corporate America in an era of strong job growth and loosening regulations at the federal level. Between 2012 and the end of 2017, the nation's 10 biggest banks by assets saw a 56 percent decline in their anticipated litigation expenses beyond their required cash reserves, according to financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The estimates signify the amounts banks expect to pay in litigation and legal costs beyond what they are required to set aside as emergency legal funds. The estimates are published each quarter with the SEC. More from The American City Business Journals: Tesla loses top safety executive to rival Waymo Intel reassigns marketing chief In the money May 14: Nearly $15M raised by Austin startups fighting cancer and simplifying road toll payments Leading the way was Regions Financial Corp., which saw a 100 percent reduction in its anticipated legal costs in excess of reserves over the past five years, indicating the bank isn't expecting any major settlements in the coming months. Regions did not respond to requests for comment on its legal position. Likewise, Citigroup reduced its estimate by 80 percent while both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and PNC Financial Services Group both lowered their estimates by more than 70 percent. LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL The downturn in litigation is not limited to the banking sector, said Dennis Tracey, chair of Hogan Lovells' litigation practice in New York. Recent U.S. Supreme Court cases tightening personal jurisdiction rules have made it much harder to file suit against a company outside of the state where it is domiciled or has its principle place of business. Tracy said that has helped to limit the number of lawsuits across all industries. Another plus for corporations: The Supreme Court recently handed down decisions reining in intellectual property cases and making it harder for so-called patent trolls to advance legal claims. Tracey also pointed to the election of President Donald Trump, whose administration has made it a priority to loosen the regulatory climate for corporations. \"There has really been a decline in litigation since the financial crisis, when many companies began to rethink their legal spending,\" Tracey said. \"I don't know if it's permanent or temporary.\" Which is not to say companies were without significant legal costs in 2017. Wells Fargo topped all U.S. companies with some $2.1 billion in after-tax legal and settlement costs, followed by Alphabet at $1.8 billion and drug maker Johnson & Johnson at $955 million, according to regulatory filings. CALM AFTER THE STORM Tracey said the reductions in bank-litigation costs are partly due to the fact that many lawsuits filed in the wake of the financial crisis are winding down. Banks were in many cases required to pay multimillion-dollar \u2014 even multibillion-dollar \u2014 settlements to resolve a wave of litigation stemming from last decade's financial and housing crises. \"The financial crisis spawned a huge amount of very high stakes litigation and regulatory actions,\" Tracey said. \"There are some remaining large matters, but among our clients that happen to be large banks, most believe the worst is behind them.\" Wells Fargo is one major exception. The banking giant has faced a raft of lawsuits in recent years, with claims ranging from allegations over unauthorized accounts to discriminatory mortgage practices to fraud affecting retail clients. Regulatory filings highlight the company's legal challenges, as Wells Fargo increased its estimate for litigation costs in excess of reserves to $2.7 billion in 2017's fourth quarter, roughly double where it was in 2012. Wells Fargo is a Hogan Lovells client. Tracey said a strong economy also is contributing to the decline in legal challenges for banks, as low unemployment and rising wages have sapped some of the motivation that's driven prior shareholder lawsuits.

New Zealand's central bank governor struck a dovish tone in his maiden monetary policy statement on Thursday, saying the next move in rates could equally be a cut or a hike, while holding settings at a record low. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's decision to keep settings unchanged was in line with economist expectations, however, Governor Adrian Orr diverged from his recent predecessors by explicitly saying an easing was as likely to be the next move as a tightening. Orr painted a relatively rosy picture of the New Zealand economy, saying both economic growth and employment remained robust, but acknowledged the stubbornly low inflation he has also inherited. \"I have started in what I would call a sweet spot for any governor to turn up in,\" Orr told reporters in his first press conference since taking the helm in March. In the official statement, Orr said rates would remain at 1.75 percent for \"a considerable period of time\" and the \"direction of our next move is equally balanced, up or down. Only time and events will tell.\" Investors reacted by pushing the New Zealand dollar to a five-month low of $0.6928, from $0.6990 before the statement. It later recovered a little to $0.6936. The decision was closely watched as economists and investors looked for clues on how Orr would handle a new policy goal of \"maximising sustainable employment\" alongside traditional inflation targeting. Orr said risks \"are relatively balanced,\" citing \"perplexing\" low wages and employment already at sustainable levels, alongside low inflation. Internationally, he said the risks included faltering growth or further tightening of financial conditions. \"The market has taken it a little bit on the dovish side,\" said Sharon Zollner, senior economist at ANZ in Auckland. The new governor put an early stamp on his authority by overhauling the policy statement, which had changed little in several months under his predecessors. Orr inherited the same tepid inflation that had forced the two previous governors to hold the official cash rate steady since slashing it to its current record low in late 2016. The bank trimmed its inflation forecasts a little to hit the 2 percent mid-point of its target band by the fourth quarter of 2020, a quarter later than previously predicted. New Zealand's annual headline inflation slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, just within the RBNZ's target band, but well below the midpoint of 2 percent. \"It is a concern and that's why we're keeping monetary policy expansionary,\" Orr said. Employment target First-quarter unemployment slid to an eight-year low of 4.4 percent, meaning that Orr could afford to push the bank's new employment goal to the periphery when making interest rate decisions. Still, Orr said the new employment target was just as important as the inflation target, and noted the central bank believed the economy was \"there or thereabouts\" in regards to reaching maximum sustainable employment. Orr later told a Parliament committee that the New Zealand dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks was being \"very well behaved\" and that its drop on Thursday was a sign that the banks' message that it would keep rates on hold for an extended period was filtering through to markets. Most economists said despite the change in tone and style, the broader economic outlook from the statement and subsequent press conference were largely in line with Orr's predecessors. \"While subtle, the forward guidance still hints that the next move is up for the cash rate,\" said Annette Beacher, chief Asia-Pacific strategist at TD Securities.

Chipotle Mexican Grill's recovery efforts, including the appointment of a new chief executive and a new delivery partnership, represent steps in the right direction, according to Piper Jaffray. The firm reiterated its overweight rating on the restaurant company's shares, predicting Chipotle's stock price could top $530 in 12 months, the highest target on Wall Street and implying 25 percent upside from Friday's close. Piper's previous target was $420. \"Chipotle shares remain a top recovery pick. When, and as (not \"if\") the recovery unfolds, meaningful leverage exists,\" analyst Nicole Regan said in a note Sunday. \"Our positive bias is based on culture change, strong unit-level economics and solid balance sheet. Catalysts include operational excellence, brand remodeling, and capital deployment.\" The appointment of Brian Niccol as chief executive officer \u2014 who arrived with a successful track record at Taco Bell \u2014 as well as a new delivery partnership with DoorDash have supported the stock and sales, Regan said, and justify same-store sales expectations in excess of 2 percent. Shares of Chipotle rose 0.7 percent in premarket trading following Piper Jaffray's optimistic call. The shares are up 47 percent this year. While Niccol built a reputation for menu innovation at Taco Bell, he recently told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that while investors shouldn't expect major changes to the company's offerings, items like breakfast burritos aren't out of the question. \"Job No. 1 is to remind people why they love Chipotle,\" Niccol told CNBC in March. \"I think there [are] opportunities to use what we have and present it in new forms, new varieties, to get people re-engaged with what they love about Chipotle.\" Such initiatives are likely welcome news to investors like Pershing Square activist Bill Ackman, who has leveraged a 10 percent stake in the company to encourage ideas like drive-thrus and breakfast offerings to reignite the beleaguered shares following a series of food safety issues. \"We're not just betting on a recovery from the food safety issue,\" Ackman told CNBC in November. \"This is one of the least optimized of thequick-servicee restaurants.\" It appears Ackman isn't the only investor willing to give Chipotle another chance. Shares of the casual Mexican eatery are up roughly 70 percent since the Chipotle board announced Niccol's appointment on Feb. 13, while a recent hike to menu prices helped the Mexican eatery post better-than-expected earnings last month. The improved performance announced April 25 sent shares soaring 24 percent the next day, their best day since the company went public in 2006, when its share price doubled.

That's a lot like what's going on with the U.S. media and telecommunications industry right now. One by one, major companies are standing up and declaring their wish to consolidate in a frantic attempt to prepare for the next decade. The most recent example was this week's announcement that number-three wireless carrier T-Mobile and number-four Sprint would merge. Brendan McDermid | Reuters T-Mobile CEO John Legere (L) speaks as Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure looks on at the New York Stock Exchange, April 30, 2018. But we don't know if Donald Trump's regulators will have more luck in controlling the rebellion than the movie's headmaster. \"The DOJ and the FCC are analyzing each deal on its own merits, but they can't do that without looking at the other deals and wondering what the combined effect will be of the deal they're looking at plus the other proposed deals that are out there,\" said Scott Wagner, a partner at Bilzin Sumberg and chair of the Federal Bar Association's Antitrust and Trade Regulation Sector. Sprint and T-Mobile announced their deal at the same time that AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner, Disney is attempting to acquire $52 billion of Fox assets, and Comcast has overbid Fox to buy U.K.-pay TV provider Sky for about $31 billion. CBS and Viacom are also in the midst of merger discussions which may result in a deal. That's well over $200 billion of M&A in the same industry. There are several reasons these moves are all happening at once. For one, deals take a while to get approved. AT&T announced it was acquiring Time Warner for $85 billion back in 2016, and it still doesn't know if it will be able to close the deal. The government sued to block the transaction, and AT&T challenged the decision in court. That trial ended this week, and a verdict is coming June 12. Similarly, Sprint and T-Mobile have considered merging for at least five years, with several stops and starts. Second, each deal begets the next. So, if number-two wireless carrier AT&T can buy Time Warner, that puts more pressure Sprint and T-Mobile to come together \u2014 size is crucial in the capital expenditure-heavy wireless business, especially as companies spend tens of billions on wireless spectrum through government auctions and corporate acquisitions. Third, millions of consumers are cutting their pay-TV bundles, choosing to buy cheaper online options from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and others. This has caused a panic in the media industry, pushing Rupert Murdoch to sell the bulk of Fox to Disney and Shari Redstone to put together CBS and Viacom. BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield likens it to the penguins huddling up in a ball to stave off winter in \"March of the Penguins.\" Regulators' last stand Many suspected Trump would usher in an era of large-scale consolidation. But the DOJ's decision to block AT&T's Time Warner acquisition didn't jibe with that narrative. Those two companies don't directly compete, but the DOJ sued because it felt AT&T's control of Time Warner would lead to higher prices for bundles of TV channels. Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Randall Stephenson, chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc., left, speaks while Jeffrey 'Jeff' Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc., listens during the WSJDLive Global Technology Conference in Laguna Beach, California. The DOJ should be even more likely to shoot down a horizontal merger that consolidates an industry with four participants to three, as in the case of T-Mobile-Sprint, says Ketan Jhaveri, a former DOJ trial attorney and antitrust lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. \"Anyone would tell you suing to block a vertical deal, which is much more complicated, and not blocking a horizontal case would be a weird way to decide antitrust policy,\" Jhaveri said. \"But we're living in a time where these contradictions may not matter anymore.\" Jhaveri gives the deal a 40 percent chance of approval but said it would have had only a 10 percent chance in an Obama administration. The approval of T-Mobile-Sprint will hinge on a classic antitrust question: do regulators think a deal will mean higher prices for consumers? One antitrust watcher thinks the risks of an government block are high. A deal \"would increase concentration significantly in the highly concentrated mobile wireless market, creating a structural dynamic that positions the deal with a difficult path to antitrust clearance,\" according to an April 30 note to clients from The Capital Forum, a news and analysis firm dedicated to government regulators. \"Little has changed on the competitive merits since August 2014, when the companies abandoned merger talks in response to DOJ and FCC opposition\" says Teddy Downey, The Capitol Forum's executive editor and CEO. However, if Judge Leon does allow AT&T to buy Time Warner, T-Mobile and Sprint's chances greatly improve, according to Wagner, the Federal Bar Association's antitrust chair. AT&T will be that much bigger and stronger, strengthening the argument that Sprint and T-Mobile can only compete by coming together. \"It's never a safe bet to say a 4-to-3 consolidation will get approved, but Sprint and T-Mobile have a better argument than most,\" Wagner said. \"They'll argue that AT&T and Verizon are such behemoths that they only way they can bring down prices for everyone, not just their own customers, is to get big enough to really put pressure on them.\" A loss for the DOJ may also make the regulatory body gun-shy to block another deal, Wagner said. \"Regulators don't like to lose,\" Wagner said. \"They won't want to take two big losses in a row.\" But if Judge Leon does shoot down AT&T-Time Warner, all bets are off. It could be back to the drawing board for the entire industry.

The stock closed 45.85 percent lower at 79 cents a share, down nearly 98 percent from HMNY's 52-week high of $38.86 a share hit in October. The company's market value has plunged from $281 million then to roughly $42 million at Wednesday's prices, according to FactSet. It was the stock's worst day since February 2009. Helios and Matheson Analytics disclosed in an SEC filing Tuesday that it estimated its average cash deficit was about $21.7 million a month for the seven months through April. That's a total deficit of $151.9 million. On the other hand, the company said it had about $43.4 million in available cash and deposits with merchant processors, which represent some of the payments received from MoviePass subscription plans. \"We will need proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to our Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord Genuity, or other sources of capital, starting in May 2018,\" the filing said. show chapters Watching a film on your phone is a lot less than going to the theater: MoviePass CEO 1:56 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 04:35 The product lets users watch one movie in theaters a day for roughly $10 or less a month. Although many criticize the business model as unsustainable, some say MoviePass could be as disruptive to the struggling theater industry as Netflix was to movie rentals. Since HMNY bought its majority stake in MoviePass in August 2017, the number of subscribers has multiplied at least 100 times to more than 2 million in February, according to company releases. \"They're burning through $20 million a month and have $40 million on hand, so they can last two more months,\" Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research, at Wedbush, said in an email. \"I don't see how they turn it around unless they charge much more or they limit how many movies their customers can see.\" \"It's impossible to run a business where the cost of sales is 2x the revenues,\" Pachter said, based on his estimates. For a few weeks, MoviePass reduced the number of movies new subscribers could see a month to four. But it reintroduced the movie-a-day model last week, and updated its technology to prevent users from sharing accounts. \"We have always known, from when MoviePass took off in August, that it was going to be a high cash burn business model,\" Ted Farnsworth, chairman and CEO of Helios and Matheson Analytics, said in a statement. He noted the rate of cash burn dropped by about 35 percent to 40 percent after the latest changes to MoviePass. \"We are not changing our guidance on 5 million subscribers by the end of this year \u2013 which should make us profitable/cash flow positive according to our business model,\" Farnsworth said. \"We have access in capital markets to over $300 million.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/27/105165761-DZZaDgoX4AE6651.jpg?v=1532965348", "keywords": [{"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 40 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "31 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a day earlier"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "45.85 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "79 cents"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "nearly 98 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HMNY"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "38.86"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "October"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$281 million"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "roughly $42 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "FactSet"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "February 2009"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "about $21.7 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the seven months through April"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$151.9 million"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "about $43.4 million"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Equity Distribution Agreement"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Canaccord Genuity"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "1:56 PM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "9"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a day"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "roughly $10"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "less a month"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Netflix"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "August 2017"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "at least 100"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "more than 2 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "February"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$20 million"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$40 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "two more months"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Michael Pachter"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Wedbush"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "2x"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Pachter"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a few weeks"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "four"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "August"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ted Farnsworth"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Helios"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "about 35 percent to 40 percent"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "MoviePass"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "5 million"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the end of this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Farnsworth"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "over $300 million"}], "description": "Shares of MoviePass owner Helios and Matheson Analytics are down nearly 98 percent from their 52-week high hit in October.

Morris Mark: Comcast sees itself as a media company instead of a communications company 11:36 AM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 02:37 Comcast's plan to outbid Disney for Fox's assets is evidence that CEO Brian Roberts believes the deal is too unique for Comcast to pass up without a fight. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.) Pushing away Disney won't be easy. Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch already agreed to take less money from Disney than Comcast, a sign that he sees a higher future value in Disney shares. While Disney is paying in stock, Comcast is talking to banks to raise about $60 billion for an all-cash counterbid. That would top Disney's December offer, valued at the time at $52.4 billion. Murdoch owns 17 percent of Fox's outstanding shares, so it's possible Comcast could convince enough Fox shareholders to take an all-cash offer even if Murdoch resists. If that doesn't work, Comcast would still prefer a consolation prize to nothing. Could Disney strike a deal with Comcast, where it effectively splits up Fox's assets, in lieu of an all-out bidding war? Here are the Fox assets Comcast covets: Sky PLC. Comcast generates nearly all of its revenue from within the United States. International growth has long been viewed as the next horizon for the largest U.S. cable provider. Sky owns billions of dollars worth of original and exclusive content, including Premier League soccer rights. It's also a European pay-TV and internet provider \u2014 the same business that Comcast has dominated for more than a decade. Fox owns 39 percent of Sky and is attempting to acquire the rest (currently a publicly traded entity). Comcast also wants the entire business, having already topped Fox's bid for the outstanding 61 percent with a $31 billion offer. Star India. Comcast would love to have a foothold in India, where entertainment consumption growth is massive. Netflix, too, is trying to crack the country, which analysts suggest could be a huge growth engine. Star India, which operates about 70 different entertainment channels, reaches more than 720 million viewers a month in more than 100 countries. Star also owns sports rights, including a $940 million deal for India's most popular sport, cricket, signed just last month. Sports rights are seen as the lifeblood of the traditional pay-TV ecosystem (Comcast's core business) because consumers watch games live rather than on demand. Hulu. Speaking of on-demand, Comcast has a hedge against the decline of pay-TV: its stake in Hulu. Comcast's NBCUniversal owns 30 percent of the platform. The remainder is split among Disney (30 percent), Fox (30 percent) and Time Warner (10 percent), which may soon be part of AT&T if the government fails to block the deal. The Fox deal would give Disney a controlling stake, thus tipping the balance of power around Hulu to Disney CEO Bob Iger. This would lead to an unstable situation for Comcast, likely forcing a sale of its stake to Disney. But if Comcast could wrestle away Fox's stake in Hulu, it would become the controlling owner of Hulu and could use it as a defense against Netflix and Disney's new streaming service, which will debut next year. 'Is Bob Iger prepared for a true battle?' Still, don't expect Disney to simply hand Comcast all three jewels. Disney won't be content walking away only with Fox's movie studio, entertainment cable channels, regional sports networks and a handful of other assets, said BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield. \"What Disney lacks is a greater global presence and a direct-to-consumer skill-set,\" Greenfield said. \"In other words, the entire reason Disney wants this deal is for the assets that Comcast also wants. Is Bob Iger prepared for a true battle? Because I expect Brian Roberts to go all-in on this.\" Comcast's management doesn't see another company it wants to acquire that's remotely as strategically valuable as Fox's assets, according to people familiar with the matter. That suggests Comcast isn't going to walk away easily. Splitting the Fox assets may be the simplest plan for Disney to escape a drawn-out, expensive war. \"Comcast needs to have the Fox assets,\" Greenfield said. \"Does Disney really need a distribution platform or a bigger studio? If I'm Bob Iger, I've got to be thinking, how much am I willing to pay for this? Maybe I'm better off letting them have it, taking the breakup fee, and using my money to buy something else.\" Iger is scheduled to speak Tuesday after Disney reports earnings around 4 p.m. ET.

annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, April 18, 2017. David Marcus, Facebook's head of Messenger, is going to head up a new group focused on the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin. \"I'm setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch,\" Marcus said in a post Tuesday afternoon on the social media site. Marcus joined the board of Coinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, in December. The news came as Facebook implemented its biggest executive shakeup in 15 years, Recode reported Tuesday. The company confirmed the report. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in early January that the company will begin looking into cryptocurrencies and \"how to best use them in our services.\" Blockchain technology quickly creates a permanent, secure record of transactions between two parties and eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank. Bitcoin is the first application of the technology.

Futures contracts are currently implying a funds rate of 2.21 percent from the current range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.

However, the Federal Open Market Committee meets in June, during which members will get a chance to update their forecasts. Hawkish expectations are rising even though inflation pressures have been held at bay. The personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and energy is at 1.9 percent, and the Dallas Fed's inflation gauge is at 1.8 percent, both narrowly below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. In addition, wage pressures have been low, with average annual earnings rising a less-than-expected 2.6 percent annualized for April. However, Fed officials, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, have been expressing concern about the effects that loose monetary policy can have on asset valuations. Also, the unemployment rate's drop to 3.9 percent could weigh on Fed officials who follow the Phillips Curve, an economic model that indicates wage pressures will rise as the jobless level falls. Recently enacted fiscal stimulus in the form of lower taxes and higher spending levels also could prove inflationary. \"Now, with fiscal policy turning from restrictive to stimulative, the economy growing above trend, and investment rising, the short-term equilibrium interest rate is rising, too,\" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech Monday in Paris. \"As the expansion continues, it could be that in order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move the fed funds rate, for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the longer run.\" Mester is considered one of the Fed's more hawkish members.

Billionaires Elon Musk and Warren Buffett engaged in a war of words over the weekend. In an earnings call last week, Tesla co-founder Musk criticized so-called \"moats\" but he wasn't referring to the sort of moat you'd find around a castle. Instead, he was talking about the term coined by Buffett, referring to a buffer that companies need surrounding them to help them maintain a competitive edge. According to Musk, \"the pace of innovation\" is more important. But Buffett shot back on Saturday, arguing that companies with strong, sustainable moats do exist and that technology has not destroyed them in every industry. The billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway quipped: \"Elon may turn things upside down in some areas. I don't think he'd want to take us on in candy.\" Berkshire Hathaway owns See's Candies. Following Buffett's comments, Musk said on Twitter that he was \"super super serious\" about starting his own candy company. Tweet Berkshire Hathaway bought See's Candies in 1972 and is still the confectioner's parent company to this day. Tesla earnings call Musk's comment about starting a See's competitor might not come as a surprise to many. He has previously fulfilled promises, ranging from building the world's largest lithium ion battery plant to selling flamethrowers via his tunneling firm The Boring Company. David A. Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett But the billionaire's pledge to start a candy company comes at a time when intense criticism pours over his management of Tesla. The electric carmaker reported a lower-than-expected loss in the first quarter last week but analysts worry that the amount of money the firm burns through might mean it needs to raise more funds in the near future. Some were unimpressed by Musk's handling of a conference call with analysts following Tesla's financial statement, in which he called a question from one analyst \"boring.\" Musk ignored one question on the production of the company's Model 3 cars, instead moving to answer questions from Galileo Russell, a YouTube user and Tesla enthusiast.

Bitcoin is created through an energy-intensive process known as mining, in which computers receive the cryptocurrency as reward for solving complex mathematical equations. Processing power to guess the solution is known as \"hash power,\" which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019. \"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report. Performance of bitcoin over the last 12 months Source: Coinbase Bitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest. Concerns about a regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year. However, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said. He said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to breakeven for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits. \"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,\" Doctor said during a conference call Thursday. Mining depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cooling equipment and specialized hardware, known as rigs. As of May 6, Fundstrat estimates the cash break-even price for the older Antminer S7 model is $6,003 per bitcoin, and $2,368 for the newer Antminer S9. Both are made by Beijing-based Bitmain, which Bernstein analysts estimate had $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits last year. \"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,\" Doctor said. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. He issued his first formal report on the cryptocurrency last July, when bitcoin traded near $2,540. At the time, Lee predicted bitcoin could become a substitute for gold and reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022. show chapters Palihapitiya: I am a Buffett 'disciple' but he's wrong about bitcoin 8:10 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 04:48 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/19/105143510-GettyImages-934467996.jpg?v=1528228053", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "as high as $64,000"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "2019 5:14 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "10"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "as high as $64,000"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "350 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2019"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BTC"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "about $36,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2019 year end"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000-$64,000"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Sam Doctor"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last 12 months"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Coinbase Bitcoin"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "9,300"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "midday"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Last year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "less than $1,000"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "above $19,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 6"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Antminer"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "6,003"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "2,368"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Antminer S9"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Beijing"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Bitmain"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$3 billion"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$4 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tom Lee"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last July"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "2,540"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Lee"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$20,000 to $55,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2022"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:10 AM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "9"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "04:48"}], "description": "The growth of bitcoin \"mining\" activity could send the cryptocurrency's price as high as $64,000, investment research firm Fundstrat said Thursday.

He said his company is very interested in blockchain and how it can be applied to health care. When the three-day conference kicked off Monday morning, the crowd at the New York Hilton Midtown was so large that it took one CNBC reporter over 75 minutes to get her entrance badge. The line went across the Hilton lobby and continued on another floor connected by an escalator. Kate Rooney | CNBC Many attendees had to wait more than an hour to register at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus 2018 conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. \"Whilst we apologize for any delays, Consensus 2018 has received overwhelming interest and is the largest blockchain-focused event ever held in the United States,\" Jacob Donnelly, director of marketing at CoinDesk, said in a statement. \"We are working to reduce the wait time.\" During last year's conference, bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000. The cryptocurrency went on to top $19,000 seven months later in December. But it has since lost more than half its value and was trading near $8,700 Monday morning. More than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are scheduled around Consensus as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. \"It is a bit chaotic in here,\" said Ronnie Moas, head of independent market research firm Standpoint Research. \"I think they sold too many tickets.\" \"Everyone is here. A lot of the top 100 crypto names are here. The developers are here,\" said Moas, who predicts bitcoin will triple to $28,000 by the end of 2019. He said he paid $2,999 for his ticket.

Warring creditor groups in Puerto Rico's ongoing debt restructuring have reached an agreement that could resolve one of the most contentious disputes in the more than $70 billion bankruptcy case. A proposed settlement would provide approximately $10 billion of debt relief and would resolve substantial risks to the Commonwealth, according to the executive summary. It would also end a more than yearlong court battle between two top tier creditor groups, which have been fighting over who has first rights to the island's sales-tax revenue for bond payments. Those groups are the owners of general obligation bonds and owners of bonds issued by Cofina, which are supported by sales tax revenue. The groups announced the plan in separate statements on Monday. The two have agreed to set up a trust that would take in Puerto Rico's 5.5 percent sales and use tax for 40 years and then pay out to the separate bondholder groups, Mark Palmer, a BTIG analyst who covers bond insurers, wrote in a note on Monday. \"The trust would then make an exchange offer for all GO bonds and allowed general unsecured claims (GUCs),\" the note said. Cofina bondholders would receive 52.5 percent of the sales tax revenue, while general obligation bondholders would get 46.2 percent. \"The supporting parties have come together for the first time in years to forge an agreement on a settlement framework that provides for a consensual path to a successful restructuring. The settlement framework reached by this diverse group of stakeholders would significantly decrease the duration and cost of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, while also providing for substantial deleveraging,\" the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders said in a statement. Other supporting parties in the settlement are the Bonistas del Patio, which represents island residents who own bonds, and the bond insurers Assured Guaranty, Ambac and MBIA. In total, the supporting parties hold more than $11 billion of Puerto Rico's debt. Cofina's bondholders would share $12.1 billion, which amounts to recoveries of 93 percent to 95 percent for the senior bondholders and 42.2 percent to 43.2 percent for the subordinate bondholders, or about 64 percent combined. General obligation bondholders would get $10.7 billion, a recovery for them of 58.6 percent. Sources familiar with the matter told CNBC that the general obligation creditors would be able to pursue additional claims from the Commonwealth for the amount not covered by the payments from the trust. The government of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico's Financial Oversight and Management Board were not part of the talks, and both parties rejected the terms. The seven-member Oversight Board, which oversees the beleaguered island's finances, said the economic terms of the creditor proposal did not align with the fiscal plan it certified on April 19, calling it \"completely unaffordable\". \"In the Board's view, the proposed terms would create large and recurring structural deficits over the long-run as compared to the long-term primary surpluses projected in the certified New Fiscal Plan, which are highly dependent on the Government's full implementation of said Fiscal Plan, with no aspect as critical to long-term economic growth as prompt enactment of the proposed labor reform,\" the Board said in a written statement. The Cofina Coalition, made up of those who hold approximately $4 billion of senior and subordinate Cofina bonds, supports the proposed settlement but said it also believes that there are other avenues for an agreement to be reached. \"While members of the Coalition support the COFINA-GO settlement framework, the group also proposed alternative settlement terms \u2013 again with significant principal haircuts to COFINA \u2013 in mid-April to other constituencies that include the Commonwealth Agent and the Official Committee of Retirees,\" a written statement from the Coalition said.

Verizon Communications shares should rise this year as a healthy dividend yield lures investors ahead of clarity on its path for 5G wireless, according to J.P. Morgan. The firm raised its rating on the company's shares to overweight from neutral, foreseeing a better competitive climate over the next 12 months. \"Verizon seems to be the one carrier that is heads down, executing on the business, and could see its share improve commensurately,\" analyst Philip Cusick wrote Friday. \"We have an increased level of confidence that revenue can stabilize and potentially start to grow. Given the potential issues and distractions of its wireless competitors, we are less negative on the overall wireless industry.\" The J.P. Morgan team \u2013 which recently held a meeting with Verizon chief executive Lowell McAdam \u2013 said the company could introduce a number of mobile 5G handsets in 2019. The long-term goal focuses on developing industrial applications, such as smart cities, connected cars and Internet of Things. The 5 percent dividend yield on Verizon shares should also attract investors, the analyst said, despite the 10-year Treasury note yield's recent move toward 3 percent. \"If rates continue higher, Verizon with a 5 percent yield could struggle. We would balance this though with the defensive nature of the business, its 66 percent payout ratio and high dividend yield, and declining leverage,\" Cusick wrote. \"We believe that from this price, when including the dividend, Verizon shares should outperform in a flat to falling market.\" The analyst held his 12-month price target steady at $58, implying 22 percent upside over the next year. Verizon's stock is down 10 percent since January, though shares were up nearly 1.5 percent in premarket trading Friday. He also noted CEO McAdam's lukewarm attitude toward buying or merging with media companies, saying that Verizon has no plan to establish its own video streaming platform but that it plans to announce a partnership with an existing provider later this month. \"The company also downplayed interest in buying cable or large spectrum assets, though commenting that each could make sense at the right price,\" Cusick added. \"Management is comfortable with the company's asset portfolio, making us less worried about the potential distraction of a big media, cable, or spectrum deal.\" Wall Street has long speculated on a Verizon deal, theorizing that a tie-up with a large media conglomerate like Comcast could be financially sound given rampant consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries. Other analysts, like Citigroup's Jason Bazinet, have encouraged such a merger, arguing that the tip-up could boost revenue at the combined company. Telecom giant AT&T and media giant Time Warner are waiting on regulatory approval for their $85 billion combination, which would marry video content with delivery on mobile devices.

Including HP, Dell and other companies that don't break out their China revenues brings the total estimate to around $150 billion, the analysts said. The U.S.-China trade dispute has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. In mid-April, the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE for seven years. The decision was a response to ZTE's violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea, to which the Chinese company pleaded guilty last year. Trading in its Hong Kong and Shenzhen-listed shares was halted after the ban, and last week the company said its main business operations have ceased. However, President Donald Trump unexpectedly said Sunday that he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE \"get back into business, fast.\" Shares of optical component makers working directly or indirectly with ZTE rose in Monday morning trading: Acacia Communications received 30 percent of 2017 total revenue from the Chinese telecom company. Shares closed up 8.7 percent. Oclaro generated 18 percent of fiscal year 2017 revenue from ZTE. Shares closed up 2.9 percent.

For their part, Goldman Sachs economists still maintain that the Fed will raise rates three more times this year, well ahead of Wall Street consensus. Mueller-Glissmann upgraded cash for the next three months. \"The competition from cash for other asset classes has picked up.\" The dollar index surged 0.4 percent on Tuesday, to 93.16, a 2018 high against a basket of other currencies as a rout of the euro prompted traders to buy the greenback. The dollar has now risen for three consecutive weeks. While rising interest rates can be a sign of a stronger economy, some worry that rising short-term Treasury payments could become competitive with stocks and add to market jitters. Major stock indexes have underwhelmed in 2018 after a spell of volatility in February and March sent the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 spiraling into correction territory. The Goldman team added that political uncertainty around trade and U.S. midterm elections doesn't help the investing thesis either. \"In addition to a worsening growth/inflation mix investors had to digest a pick-up in policy uncertainty, a lot of which has been concentrated in the U.S: continued risk of a trade war and regulation uncertainty on the U.S. tech sector, which is the largest in the U.S. equity market.\" Stocks fell modestly Tuesday afternoon ahead of President Donald Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal, a landmark diplomatic agreement forged under the Obama administration. \u2014 CNBC's Patty Martell contributed to this report.

AMP confirmed that lawsuits have been filed by global law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Melbourne-based firm Phi Finney McDonald on behalf of some shareholders. \"AMP intends to vigorously defend the proceedings,\" the company said in a statement ahead of its annual general meeting later on Thursday, where angry shareholders are expected to challenge board re-appointments and executive pay. Three directors quit AMP on Tuesday following the departure of the company's chairman, chief executive and in-house lawyer, after revelations at the inquiry that the once-venerable firm had lied to regulators, allegedly doctored an independent report, and charged customers fees for no service. Quinn Emanuel said on Wednesday it had filed a class action on behalf of shareholders who have seen AMP's market capitalization plunge by around A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) following admissions made by AMP executives during the inquiry. \"The class action alleges that, amongst other things, AMP breached its continuous disclosure obligations and made misleading statements, causing shareholders significant loss,\" the firm said in a statement. Last month, Australian litigation financier IMF Bentham had said it would fund class action proceedings against AMP that would be conducted by Phi Finney McDonald.

Two days after Chris Matta earned a prized promotion at storied investment bank Goldman Sachs, he shocked his bosses. He decided to walk away from it all. It was mid-December, and Matta had just been told that after six grueling years toiling at Goldman, he had made vice president. Matta, who oversaw billions of dollars in investments in the wealth management division, had just climbed a rung of Wall Street's hierarchy and was in line for more pay and status. But Matta, 28, had a new goal in mind. All throughout 2017, the bitcoin he owned exploded in value. With the help of two former colleagues from Goldman, Matta wanted to create an investment vehicle to take advantage of the intense interest in cryptocurrencies. He couldn't wait. \"It's safe to say, you leave a good amount of money on the table walking away from Goldman,'' said Matta, who resembles Jared Dunn, a character from the HBO show \"Silicon Valley.\" \"But I saw it as a calculated risk.'' show chapters BK's crypto class: Know when to FODL 'em 6:14 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 05:35 Matta's unusually swift departure \u2014 he didn't even stick around to get the bonus he had earned that year \u2014 is a sign of the powerful lure of cryptocurrencies. Fortunes were made last year, when a single bitcoin surged from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. That sparked a bull market in new crypto-based funds jockeying for a piece of the action. Matta declined to say how much his bonus would have been. Digital currencies are the latest competition Wall Street faces for the young talent that fuels their businesses. In a previous era, thousands of the best and brightest young men and women flocked to Wall Street for a shot at making a fortune. Those who became managing directors \u2014 a level or two above vice president \u2014 could expect to earn millions of dollars a year. Some truly struck gold, such as Andrew Hall, a Citigroup commodities trader who made $100 million in 2008. No place epitomized Wall Street's allure quite like Goldman Sachs, a 149-year-old investment bank that had been the most profitable securities firm in history. The firm has produced so many senior executives and public officials, including two Treasury secretaries in the past decade, it's jokingly referred to as Government Sachs. After post-financial-crisis regulations curbed risk-taking and pay, for some the banks have turned into training grounds where valuable connections are made before leaving for something better. Now, the smart kids are leaving Wall Street to hit it big. When Matta's boss \u2014 a Goldman partner and suspenders-wearing embodiment of old-school Wall Street \u2014 heard about Matta's decision, he summoned him to his office. \"They called in the CEO of my organization, and he said, basically, 'Are you crazy? Do you realize the risk you are taking here?''' Matta said. \"'You are giving up on your bonus!'\" His managers had a counter-pitch: stick around until February to collect your bonus. But Matta and his co-founders, Ali Hassan and Michael Kazley, all under 30 years old, wanted to set up shop and start taking in client money by Jan. 1. So while his former colleagues were enjoying the holidays, Matta and his friends were pouring their life savings into setting up their new firm, Crescent Crypto Asset Management. \"In the crypto world, every month is like a year in the equities space,'' Matta said. \"The amount of things that would change in that time, the number of funds that would come to market, it would just be a much more difficult landscape for us if we were trying to get things up and running in February.'' Matta, who grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, and studied economics and finance in college, started at Goldman Sachs in 2011 in the bank's summer analyst program. He had roles in risk management and big data technology solutions, and then shifted into the bank's wealth management division, eventually helping oversee $7 billion in a philanthropy fund and a trust portfolio. By 2016, Matta became intrigued by bitcoin. show chapters From earnings to the crypto space, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bulls makes case for new highs 6:13 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 04:57 \"At Goldman you're always looking for alternative asset classes, and I said, maybe this is an alternative investment that we should start to take seriously,'' Matta said. The mania around the rise of cryptocurrencies has parallels to the dot-com boom from 20 years ago. Then, too, it wasn't uncommon for Wall Street bankers to head west to Silicon Valley in search of fortunes. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had a series of finance jobs, including at a Deutsche Bank predecessor and quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw.) The rise of cryptocurrencies has sparked a bull market in hedge funds tied to the assets. While only five existed before 2013, more than 200 were created since 2017, according to Autonomous Research. By the time bitcoin and other coins began their dizzy ascent in 2017, Matta was known at work and with family as a crypto expert. \"People were asking us about it nonstop, saying, 'I'll give you $50,000, can you do this for me?''' The three founders are taking what they've learned on Wall Street and applying it to an asset class that was created to disrupt financial institutions. Their inaugural product is an index fund made up of the 20 largest coins; they charge 2 percent of assets under management. Gains have been harder to come by this year. Concerns over regulation, fraud and high-profile hacks drove bitcoin down at the start of the year, losing more than half its value in January. It has since whipsawed investors, trading between about $6,000 and $10,000. Matta is undeterred. He believes that digital currencies and the blockchain technology underpinning it have the potential to transform finance in ways that are hard to imagine. \"It's either going to zero, or it's going magnitudes higher,'' he said. Still, their little company has already had some success. Matta said they have made progress toward their goal of attracting $50 million in assets this year. They've hired five employees for a research desk. They are also in discussions with established trading firms seeking to make strategic investments in Crescent Crypto, Matta said. Ironically, the three men have Goldman to thank for their success so far. \"The Goldman brand is obviously very strong; people respect its people,\" Matta said. \"It gets you in the door in a lot of cases.\" And the investment bank is still a strong lure for talent, attracting a quarter of a million annual applicants for a few thousand positions. The talent system at investment banks relies on a steady stream of hungry young men and women to populate their trading floors, and most end up leaving. Matta said that when he left, he was one of the last members from his summer program. He figures that even if crypto goes bust or his fund fails to get traction and his savings are wiped out, he's gained invaluable connections and experience. In that case, Goldman could welcome him back, although he would prefer working for a start-up, he said. \"I don't regret it at all,'' Matta said. \"It's been the most exciting few months of my life, honestly.''

J.P. Morgan Chase, the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, has created a new management team to help it better serve Wall Street clients who increasingly want to trade with algorithms through electronic platforms. The bank named Chris Berthe as its head of global cash execution with responsibility over teams that electronically match buyers and sellers of stocks, according to a memo exclusively obtained by CNBC. Dennis Fitzgerald will be head of global cash risk, which is dominated by stock trading departments where the bank uses its own balance sheet to help facilitate trades. The memo was sent Wednesday from equities trading co-heads Jason Sippel and Mark Leung. The world of equities trading, which generates roughly $58 billion a year in revenue for Wall Street, has continued to shift to electronic platforms on the one hand, or to specialists in trading large blocks of stock and other scenarios requiring the bank's capital, Sippel said in an interview. show chapters JPMorgan investment specialist: We're favoring international markets over U.S. markets 10:39 AM ET Mon, 7 May 2018 | 02:49 In February, J.P.

Helped by investments in electronic trading, prime brokerage and quantitative services, J.P. Morgan has climbed the global rankings. It had 10.3 percent of the market for equities and prime brokerage last year, compared with 7.7 percent in 2012. Berthe and Fitzgerald will rely on the company's investments in big data, quantitative research and other technologies, the memo said. The company has a $10.8 billion budget for technology spending across its businesses this year. The bank also created a new group, Americas execution services, led by Adam Englander and Matthew Mallgrave, to make sure that clients can easily transact in any way, whether it's with humans or by electronic means. \"We believe that the new organizational structure and the people in it are perfectly suited to gain competitive share from the rapid evolution that is occurring all around us,'\" Sippel and Leung said in the memo.

In hindsight, AT&T didn't spend its money well. Not only is Cohen under federal investigation for his business practices, but the Trump administration's Department of Justice sued to block the $85 billion acquisition. \"There is no other way to say it \u2014 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\" the company said in a statement Friday. AT&T hired Cohen after Trump's lawyer told the company he planned to leave the Trump Organization during \"the post-election transition period,\" AT&T said in its memo to employees. AT&T then signed a one-year contract for $50,000 a month through 2017 for Cohen's consultancy services. \"Our contract with Cohen was expressly limited to providing consulting and advisory services, and it did not permit him to lobby on our behalf without first notifying us (which never occurred),\" the company said. \"We didn't ask him to set up any meeting for us with anyone in the Administration and he didn't offer to do so.\" show chapters White House addresses AT&T payment to Michael Cohen 6:04 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 01:30 AT&T's future \u2014 and the future of AT&T's peers and competitors \u2014 depends on whether the megadeal goes through. AT&T challenged the government's decision in court, and a verdict in the trial, which has now ended, will be announced June 12. Most antitrust experts initially expected AT&T's deal with Time Warner to be approved by a Trump administration. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump said he would block the deal. Still, Department of Justice regulators are supposed to make decisions independently from the president. \"AT&T hired several consultants to help us understand how the President and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues important to the company, including regulatory reform at the FCC, tax reform, and antitrust enforcement, specifically our Time Warner deal,\" the company said in the memo.

Fed vice chairman 2:10 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 07:19 Federal Reserve Inflation continues to be pretty much as subdued as it was when Stanley Fischer stepped down from the Fed, the former central bank vice chairman said Wednesday. As his former colleagues plan to continue what has been a steady rate-hiking cycle, Fischer said they have \"some time to wait\" as conditions unfold. \"When I left, which was only six or seven months ago [in October 2017], all the concerns were we're not seeing any inflation,\" said told CNBC's Leslie Picker during an interview on the sidelines of the Context Leadership Summit in Las Vegas. \"I don't think we're seeing a whole lot more inflation than we saw at that time.\" Indicators on one of the Fed's key economic points have been mixed lately. The personal consumption expenditures index, which is the Fed's preferred measure, rose 1.9 percent excluding food and energy, in March, and was up 2 percent on a headline basis. The Fed considers 2 percent inflation to be an ideal level. However, wage growth has remained below what policymakers would like to see. Still, the Fed has continued to raise interest rates, with the next hike widely expected to happen in June. Officials have worried that continuing to keep rates low runs the risk of creating financial imbalances like asset bubbles, and gives the Fed little wiggle room to handle the next crisis. \"Central banks who don't look at inflation and don't worry about inflation can make more mistakes than they should,\" Fischer said. He stated that the Fed has \"done a pretty good job\" at achieving its goals of full employment and price stability and expects \"they'll find their way to good policy.\" At an earlier panel talk with Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, Fischer said the Fed \"will have some room to move\" in the next downturn, though maybe not as much as normal. He also said the current members should prepare to handle some kind of emergency. \"My advice is to get ready, you will experience a crisis,\" he said. \"Almost every central banker experiences a crisis at some time \u2026 Bernanke got it, Yellen avoided it through excellent management and some good luck.\" Investors have been watching both the Fed with its target rate, currently at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, as well as the path of the 10-year Treasury note, which again touched 3 percent Wednesday. Whether the benchmark government debt instrument will hit 4 percent will be a function both of the market and economic conditions, El-Erian said. \"The technical argument will tend to support the economical argument to moving up from where we are,\" he said. \u2014CNBC's Dawn Giel contributed to this report.

The bank said it made a mistake when setting up the rebates and said the $15,000 in fees have been returned to the Chattanooga, Tennessee, fire and police department pension fund. The bank made its statement to CNBC after The Wall Street Journal reported that the fund's board had grilled the bank last month over what it considered to be suspicious practices in its institutional retirement and trust unit. The board fired Wells Fargo as the trustee, the Journal said. It's the latest in a string of recent setbacks for the bank. In 2016, Wells acknowledged pervasive issues with its sales practices, including setting up more than 3 million accounts without customers' knowledge as retail division employees pursued aggressive sales targets. In late 2017, the federal government asked the bank to begin an investigation into sales practices at its Wells Fargo Advisors unit after whistleblowers flagged problems in sales and products. Shares of Wells Fargo are down 10 percent since the start of the year. Here's Wells Fargo statement to CNBC: \"We acknowledge that because there was a change directed by the client in 2017, we made an error in setting up the revenue sharing associated with that change appropriately and the revenue sharing rebates did not occur as intended. We are sorry this error occurred, and upon discovery the issue was fixed and the total revenue share received from the third party fund companies (approximately $15,000) was returned to the pension fund.

He said bitcoin, which was trading just above $9,000 Thursday evening, \"continues higher from here.\" Blockchain Week's annual event kicks-off May 11 in New York City, another sign that bitcoin is on the rise, Sluymer said. The week-long event includes some of the biggest movers and shakers in the cryptocurrency world, such as St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, European Parliament member Eva Kaili and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, among others. In 2015, the first Blockchain Week saw 1,500 people in attendance. The turnout the following year nearly doubled to 2,700 attendees. This year, the event is expected to attract about 8,000 people, half of whom are coming from outside of the United States. Sluymer said, historically, bitcoin has increased each year after Consensus, one of Blockchain Week's largest events, which includes a hackathon and blockchain job fair, had taken place. In fact, in 2015, the digital currency increased 23 percent after Consensus. \"Not a huge amount considering how volatile cryptos are,\" the technician said. \"But then it moved up around year-end for about another 100 percent move.\" Bitcoin continued to edge upwards in 2016, about 10 percent after the Consensus event, and then an additional 80 percent by year's end, Sluymer said.

Bitcoin peaked at approximately $19,500 last December, before falling to lows of around $6,000 earlier this year. Sluymer said the coin's bottom may be behind us. \"There's really a bull-bear scenario, where folks are arguing where it's going,\" he said, but pointed out the strong economy and current bull market will only help the coin continue to trade higher. Bitcoin's 200-moving average, from November 2017 to May 2018, he said, is \"relatively shallow.\" \"We're already moving back from the 200-day average,\" Sluymer said.

After raising more money from top Silicon Valley investors, Robinhood has quadrupled its valuation in about a year to more than $5 billion. Less clear is how the operator of a commission-free stock trading app generates enough money to justify such a lofty amount. On Thursday, the start-up announced it raised $363 million in capital, valuing the company at $5.6 billion. That makes it about one-third the size of the online brokerage E-Trade Financial, which has a market value of nearly $17 billion. While E-Trade reported a 28 percent increase in net revenue to $708 million in the first quarter, Robinhood would not share specific information about revenue since it is a private company. Robinhood did point to two key sources of cash: a tiered monthly fee for a premium trading product and the interest it makes on uninvested customer cash. Still, the company's growth is notable. It said this week it has reached 4 million accounts, double what it had last fall, and more than E-Trade's 3.7 million. show chapters Robinhood Co-CEO on becoming a full-service financial services company 12:09 PM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 | 03:56 Whether or not Robinhood is ultimately successful, big investors are taking more notice of digital finance start-ups. This week, asset management giant BlackRock announced it led a $50 million investment round in Acorns, an app that lets users automatically invest spare change in exchange-traded funds. Acorns has signed up more than 3.3 million accounts. Stash, an investing app that lets customers begin investing with as little as $5, said in mid-April it had 2 million customers. It raised $37.5 million in fresh funding in February from a group led by Union Square Ventures. \"When millions of millennials are saying, 'yes sign me up,' the incumbents have to pay attention and valuations are just going to have to keep on going higher,\" said Javier Paz, a senior analyst at Aite Group's wealth management practice. Robinhood launched its no-fee stock trading app about three years ago and has big ambitions beyond being a stock brokerage. It began options trading last year and limited cryptocurrency trading this year. \"In the next couple of years, I think you'll see Robinhood looking like a full-service consumer finance company,\" Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO, told CNBC on a phone interview this week. The subscription product, Robinhood Gold, rolled out in September 2016, offering margin trading and extended-hours trading. It allows users with a minimum balance of $2,000 to trade on borrowed money, as much as two times what they have on deposit, for a flat fee depending on the amount. Margin trading, a common feature of online brokerages such as E-Trade and Interactive Brokers. But Robinhood charges differently for these margin trades. While the traditional online brokerages charge interest on a specific loan amount, Robinhood Gold's flat monthly fee covers how much \"buying power\" a customer requests. Trading $10,000 on margin would incur a 3.2 percent annual loan rate at Interactive Brokers, and 9.75 percent at E-Trade. That's $320 and $975 a year, respectively. Robinhood Gold charges $40 a month for $8,000 in buying power, or $50 for $12,000, regardless of whether the investor uses the full amount. That would be $480 and $600 a year, respectively. For an investor wanting access to $10,000 a year, the monthly fee adds up to $600 a year. \"They tend to be on the low side, but not the lowest,\" Aite's Paz said. \"They have to make some money somehow, and this is allowing them to ride alongside the bull market.\" \"If the market starts to top and starts to retrace, they're not going to see as much money on their margin lending business,\" Paz said. \"Other brokers don't have as much dependence on margin lending.\" Robinhood said in October that 75 percent of its transaction volume went through its Gold product, which was growing 17 percent month-over-month. The company said this week it had no updated figures to share. \"It's a very unique approach they've taken,\" said Bill Capuzzi, CEO of Apex Clearing, which manages the infrastructure and operating systems for Robinhood and other financial services companies. \"They tried to demystify what margin is.\" \"Online brokerage was a dying business and the margins were rotting and you only had the big players,\" Capuzzi said. \"In comes this start-up [that] goes to 4 million clients. [It] just goes to show there's still a lot of room in the market.\" Robinhood said the 4 million accounts figure refers to accounts approved to trade, but may not all be funded. How much money those users end up storing in Robinhood also affects its revenue, since the company collects interest on customer deposits, similar to a bank. Account sizes range from $50 to millions of dollars, the start-up said. \u2014 CNBC's Eric Rosenbaum contributed to this report.

decisions. But before you approach the hereafter, you'll likely have more than a few regrets about poor money management. Fiscal distress often results from a lack of long-term planning. Failing to save enough for retirement\u2014a decades-long endeavor \u2014 is the biggest financial regret among American adults, according to a Bankrate survey, followed closely by not having an adequately funded emergency savings account. Much like your physical well being, financial health requires both good habits and a bit of luck. By setting up financial goals and working hard to accomplish them, you can focus your energy on the more meaningful parts of your life. 1. Maintain a top-notch FICO score You're going to need to borrow a large sum of money at some point in your life. Want to buy a house? A car? Chances are you're going to need to go to the bank first. The more creditworthy you appear to a financial institution, the less interest you'll end up paying. More from Bankrate: What the Wells Fargo settlement means for mortgage borrowers How to buy a house when you have student loan debt 5 steps to finding the best mortgage lender Guarding a super prime score, generally around 740, should be an important financial goal. Most Americans fall short. The average FICO score hit an all-time high last year, reaching 700. You should aim higher. Although don't stress over trying to get a perfect mark of 850. Life's too short. How do you improve? Pay off all your credit card bills in full every month, on time. Use no more than 20 percent of your available credit and keep your oldest accounts going even if you don't need them. 2. Have a 6-month emergency fund Amassing six months' worth of spending in a high-yield savings account is really hard. Depending on where you live and how much you earn, you're looking at a stash of somewhere between $20,000 and $50,000. Only 39 percent of Americans would be able to pay for a $1,000 emergency with cash, per a recent Bankrate survey. Wages have mostly stagnated since the Great Recession, and low interest rates are a headache for savers. But this is a fundamentally important step. An emergency fund is hedge against disaster. If you were laid off, it would let you take your time picking your next role. If you got sick or the roof caved in, you wouldn't have to got into debt. If you're starting from scratch, place any windfall you receive into a savings account. You can even name the account \"break in case of emergency.\" 3. Become a 401(k) millionaire How much you need in retirement savings depends on your current standard of living, but you may face some adjustments after calling it quits. Half of all households are at risk of spending their golden years with less spending power than they are used to, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The old rule of thumb suggests you need eight times your final income in retirement savings (there are more detailed measures you can use, or you can hire a financial planner). Still, retirement saving is relatively straightforward. Save 10 to 15 percent of your income, including a company match in your 401(k), and invest in low-cost diversified funds. One quick and easy way is to pick a target-date fund that gets more conservative (i.e. more bonds) as you age. 4. Pay off your mortgage Even if you have a low mortgage rate \u2014 mortgage rates have been muted by historical standards since the onset of the housing crisis \u2014 owning your home outright is one of the most financially liberating steps you can take, and a sure way to save money. Let's say you put 10 percent down on a $262,500 home with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.88 percent. You'll end up paying $164,000 in interest alone. Taking out a 15-year loan, instead, would save around $90,000. Even if you stick with the average loan length, consider contributing extra to your monthly payment whenever possible, and join the 36 percent of mortgage-free homeowners. 5. Make a major purchase with cash Despite an improving jobs picture and stock markets ascending to new heights, Americans are struggling with savings and debt. The personal savings rate has dropped dramatically over the past few years, while the percentage of families with credit card debt jumped by nearly six percentage points to 43.9 from 2013 to 2016, according to the Federal Reserve. The average indebted household owes $5,700. With the Fed poised to raise interest rates multiple times in 2018, taking on debt is an ever more expensive proposition. The next time you need to make a big purchase, like a family vacation or a new car, try to make it completely with cash. You'll not only enjoy the thing you just bought, but you won't face the anxiety that accompanies new debt. To ramp up your savings rate, automatically siphon a small percentage of your biweekly paycheck into an earmarked savings account. Saving automatically is the quickest way to build up your cache. 6. Pay off student loans Student loans afflict people of all ages. Nearly 1 in 6 Americans have student debt, with a median amount of $17,000. If you took on loans for postgrad studies, you owe $45,000. Meanwhile senior debt has quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If you're already putting enough away for retirement\u2014generally 10 percent of your pay, including any employer match \u2014 and have a fully-funded emergency fund, start working overtime to pay off your student debt. Put any raises, or your tax refund, to chip away at the mountain of debt.

The growth outlook for Asian economies remains strong, but the region is vulnerable to sudden tightening in global financial conditions, further market corrections and a shift towards protectionist policies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday. In its regional economic outlook update, the IMF projected Asia to grow 5.6 percent this year and next, up 0.1 percentage point from its last update in October and accounting for about two thirds of global growth. The slight improvement in near-term prospects reflects \"strong and broad-based\" global growth and trade, reinforced by fiscal stimulus in the United States. But in the medium term, risks are tilted to the downside. \"Asia remains vulnerable to a sudden and sharp tightening of global financial conditions, while too long a period of easy conditions risks a further buildup of leverage and financial vulnerabilities,\" the Fund said. \"The gains from globalization have not been shared equally, and, as highlighted by recent tariff actions and announcements, a shift toward inward-looking policies is another risk, with the potential to disrupt international trade and financial markets.\" Among other risks, the Fund cited geopolitical tensions, cyber attacks and climate change. Longer term, ageing demographics could be a substantial drag on economies and digitalisation may be a source of uncertainty. Most economies should therefore look to strengthen policy buffers as closing output gaps means they do not need further fiscal support, the Fund said. For now, with pressure on wages and prices still \"moderate\", monetary policy can remain accommodative in most of Asia. But central banks should stand ready to adjust their stances as inflation picks up, and should use macroprudential policies to contain credit growth, it said. An abrupt change in global risk appetite, which could be triggered by an inflation surprise in the United States or an escalation of Sino-U.S. trade tensions, could lead to a sudden tightening of global financial conditions. Tensions between the United States and China escalated earlier this year, when President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods to punish Beijing over unfair joint-venture and intellectual property practices. China, which denies allegations it coerces technology transfers through these channels, has warned of retaliation, including tariffs on U.S. soybeans and aircraft. Meanwhile, assets from Asia's three major economies running current account deficits \u2014 India, Indonesia and Philippines \u2014 have come under pressure in recent weeks following a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to 3 percent and a surge in oil prices to 3-1/2 year highs. While Asia's rapid growth and improved external buffers \"should help, the region remains vulnerable to a global risk-off event,\" the report said.

The Goldman Sachs-backed start-up announced a new cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar and a $110 million investment round led by profitable crypto-mining company Bitmain, which brings Circle's value near $3 billion, the company announced Tuesday. \"It unlocks an incredible amount of power for the dollar,\" said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle. \"It's basically a dollar that operates on blockchain.\" Circle is one of the most well-funded blockchain start-ups, with investors including Goldman Sachs Group and Baidu. The fintech company operates its peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Circle's new USD Coin is meant to solve a key problem in digital currencies' use case: Volatility. Critics including Stan Druckenmiller have said cryptocurrencies can't be used as a means of payment because their value changes so often and so rapidly. Bitcoin, for example, has been marked by volatility in the past 12 months and has dropped by more than 50 percent since its high near $20,000 in December, according to CoinDesk. Circle customers will be required to hold $1 for every USD Coin, keeping the price stable. Other companies, such as Tether and Basis, also have offered \"stable coins\" with a value tied to the U.S. dollar. But Allaire said there's a need for a \"compliant alternative\" to Tether, which has a $2.2 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.com. show chapters Circle's CEO on the company's growth strategy 4:41 AM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 02:10 \"When I look at the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto space, it's begging for that,\" Allaire said to a room full of journalists. \"There are a number of banks who are excited about it and will support it.\" Once U.S. dollars are transferred to Circle's USD Coins, Allaire said they can be moved within seconds thanks to blockchain technology. He said they will eventually add tokens for the euro and pound but it's less likely they'll immediately look to peg most Asian currencies because of existing competition in that arena. The framework for the coin is what's called \"open sourced,\" meaning multiple developers can work on the project and help its development. The USD Coin project is being developed by an organization called CENTRE, which will provide independent oversight of Circle's offering. Bitmain, best known as a crypto \"mining\" company, is leading a $110 million strategic investment in Circle, which the company said brings its valuation close to $3 billion. The funding round also includes existing investors such as Breyer Capital, Tusk Ventures, IDG Capital, Pantera and Blockchain Capital. Bitcoin mining requires use of special software to solve math problems in exchange for a certain number of bitcoins. Bitmain dominates that mining industry and likely made as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year. Bernstein analysts estimate that Bitmain made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017. The USD Coin is being run on a blockchain known as ethereum, but Allaire said they're open-minded about other platforms if any come to market that can outperform. \"Ethereum is the best bet but it's not necessarily the end game,\" he said. \"For now it's specifically on Ethereum.\" Circle is one of the leaders in over-the-counter bitcoin trading markets and acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex in February.

Even though Tesla remains one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S. equity market, analysts Romit Shah and Kellan Grenier believe the company could rally to $500 per share over two years, more than 60 percent from its current $303 price. \"We believe that over the next three to six months the narrative on the company will shift from insolvency risk and cash burn to market opportunity and growth,\" the analysts said. They have created a chart that sets out a path to an approximately \"$100 billion valuation within two years\" fr the automaker. show chapters 5 outrageous Elon Musk moments from the bizarre Tesla call 4:58 PM ET Tue, 14 Aug 2018 | 02:21 Breaking down the analysts' bull case, Tesla would have to deliver 1 million autos with an average sale price of $60,000 over the next two years to reach the lofty goal. The analysts also forecast that Tesla could claim 10 percent of global luxury sales by 2022, saying the current top three brands (Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi) are \"ripe for the picking.\" While Shah and Grenier remain optimistic with a buy rating, it's likely a tall order for the Palo Alto, California company, which fell short of its weekly Model 3 production goal of 2,500 at the end of the last quarter. The electric-car maker's stock is still down since January, partly on concerns over the company's ability to ramp up production of the Model 3, Tesla's first attempt at a mid-priced car. Seen by Wall Street as Tesla's key to unlocking revenue, anticipation over the Model 3 carried the stock to an all-time high of $389.61 in September. Despite the miss, many investors were relieved by the numbers. Tesla produced nearly 35,000 vehicles in its first production quarter of 2018 \u2014 a fourfold increase over the previous quarter, the company said. Tesla expects output to climb rapidly and continues to target a production rate of 5,000 vehicles a week by the end of June. With 31 percent of floating shares currently sold short, even a small jump higher in Tesla's stock price could trigger a so-called short squeeze. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); When investors short a stock, they are betting it will go down by selling borrowed shares. However, it the price rises, many of those investors are forced to buy back those shares in hopes of avoiding even more losses. That new buying can, in turn, drive a stock even higher, a dynamic known as a short squeeze. The latest production miss, though not as bad as many expected, drew probing questions from several analysts during Tesla's recent earnings call. Musk, seemingly frustrated by what he characterized as a string of \"boring, bonehead questions\" from Wall Street, cut off RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak to take questions from Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old retail investor. Spak later responded to Musk in a note to clients, assuring the chief executive he plans to \"hold Tesla accountable\" for its performance. \"Some of these questions can seem dry, boring or short-term focused, but hopefully you can appreciate that anyone looking to invest in Tesla's future must first be comfortable with its present,\" Spak wrote earlier this week. For his part, Musk defended his unusual behavior last Friday, tweeting \"The 'dry' questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis.\" Despite Musk's characterization of Spak and Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi as short sellers, the two have hold ratings on Tesla's stock.

It's never going to work,\" Roubini said Thursday at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn. \"You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering.\" Roubini, who earned the name \"Dr. Doom\" after the financial crisis, highlighted the difficulty of converting volatile digital currencies every time a user wants to buy something. Bitcoin, for example, rose more than 1,300 percent last year before losing roughly half its value in the first three months of 2018, according to CoinDesk. show chapters Don't underestimate downside risk: Nouriel Roubini 10:08 AM ET Mon, 20 March 2017 | 03:01 While he's bullish on digital payments through apps such as Alipay, Venmo, PayPal and Square, Roubini said blockchain and cryptocurrencies will not play a role in the future of finance. \"I'm affirmative on that significant disruption, but most of this has nothing to do with blockchain, nothing to do with cryptocurrency,\" he said. The economist also took on the fundraising process called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, calling them \"mostly scams.\" He pointed to research by ICO advisory firm Satis Group, which said 81 percent of them were, as Roubini put it in a column published earlier Thursday, \"created by con artists, charlatans, and swindlers looking to take your money and run.\" The economist, who is a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, debated Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys. Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind bitcoin, with a market capitalization of about $74 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum. The digital coin is backed by a blockchain, much like bitcoin, but the technology is slightly different because it uses what's known as \"smart contracts.\" Lubin advocated for self-regulation in the space, and said his company ConsenSys is working on a database that forces projects to self-disclose, mostly through \"peer pressure.\" But Roubini, who was a senior advisor to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, shot back. \"The reality is the industry does not self-regulate,\" he said. \"They're Ponzi schemes. If you wanted to self-regulate you'd stop this, and you're doing nothing about it.\" Roubini is known for his anti-crypto rhetoric and in a recent column called blockchain \"one of the most overhyped technologies ever.\" Bitcoin was one of the first applications of the blockchain, which is a public ledger of bitcoin transactions that its proponents say is tamper-proof.

Cryptocurrency conferences are still a massive business, even if bitcoin's price has plunged this year. When it kicks off this week, one ticket to CoinDesk's Consensus three-day conference in New York City can cost roughly $2,000. Well over 4,000 are expected to attend, up from 2,700 attendees last year. So at a minimum, the conference is likely bringing in $8 million. More than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are also scheduled during the days around Consensus. The bitcoin conference that began with 400 attendees three years ago is now the centerpiece of a full-blown \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Consensus conference attendance growth over the years Source: CoinDesk Last year's conferences helped drive the surge of attention on cryptocurrencies. Around Consensus 2017 last May, Bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000, and was bolstered by the first TokenSummit and Ethereal Summit. Prices then skyrocketed over the rest of the year, drawing Wall Street's interest and topping $10,000 for the first time after the \"Consensus Invest\" conference in November. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since topping $19,000 in December, but it remains more than 4 times above where it was last May. This year's speaker lineup also reflects significant inroads made by the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, whose mobile payments company Square launched bitcoin trading this year, is set to speak at Consensus on Wednesday. Other conference panelists range from government officials to start-up leaders. Consensus \"does have a reputation of, if you speak at that event you're on the map,\" said Michael Oved, co-founder of a token marketplace called AirSwap, and organizer of a blockchain conference called Fluidity, which took place Thursday. He said he purposely under-priced his conference \u2013 tickets ran from $150 to $250 \u2013 because he saw it as \"an opportunity for us to talk about the things we've been working on.\" About 700 people attended the Brooklyn event, Oved said. That would bring ticket sales to about $140,000. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month.\" -Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Other events charge at least several hundred dollars for admission, including: The two-day Ethereal Summit run by ConsenSys sells tickets for $1,300 each; TokenSummit on May 17 is sold out of regular $649 tickets, and a \"very late ticket\" costs $979; The \"Women on the Block\" conference held on Mother's Day charges $299 for general admission, and $599 for VIP access to a reception and a lounge. Childcare for children ages 5 to 11 costs $80; General admission to the May 18 NYC Blockchain Tech & Invest Summit is $899, while investors and VIP tickets are $1,299, according to Eventbrite. The ADI Cryptocurrency Mining Summit charges $499 to $699. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month,\" said Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, which runs a mobile-based cryptocurrency storage app. \"This represents an opportunity for companies that are trying to jump on that bandwagon to take advantage of that confluence of factors at the same time,\" he said. \"Obviously there's a lot of money moving around in terms of sponsorships. We're getting requests every day to sponsor.\" Getty Images Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin However, not everyone in the cryptocurrency world is happy about the massive conference industry. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted on April 26 that he is boycotting Consensus this year partly because of the high ticket price. \"The conference costs $2-$3k to attend. I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent seeking,\" Buterin said. He added that CoinDesk \"is recklessly complicit in enabling giveaway scams,\" and called their coverage of an ethereum split \"highly sensationalist.\" Tweet In a statement, CoinDesk responded that it was \"disappointed to learn of Vitalik's tweet today regarding a CoinDesk reporting error, for which we apologize. One of our reporters included an unverified link in an article; we quickly identified the error and fixed it. We strive to maintain the highest level of unbiased, ethical journalism in order to provide the best possible coverage of the blockchain industry.\" Amber Baldet, former head of blockchain at J.P. Morgan, also criticized the increasingly costly cryptocurrency events. \"The irony of high-priced conferences is they're the ones least likely to be paying speakers within the community, who care the most & need the platform to share new work,\" she tweeted on April 28. \"Corporate expense accounts subsidize people who rarely say anything novel, 'celeb keynotes' extract high fees.\" She is a speaker at two of the primary events of the week, Ethereal Summit and Consensus. \"I'm not getting paid for either,\" she said in another tweet, adding that their livestreams \"are a great way to democratize access.\" 'So many conferences...it's crazy' With all the hype and partying that conferences bring, it's also unclear whether they ultimately help start-ups progress along a planned production schedule \u2014 especially when many can struggle under inexperienced management. \"There are so many conferences now,\" Oved said. \"It's crazy.

Walmart said on Saturday in a filing with a U.S. regulator that it may take India's Flipkart public in as early as four years, detailing for the first time a potential listing timeline for Walmart's largest-ever acquisition. Minority investors holding 60 percent of Flipkart's shares \"acting together, may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering\" (IPO) four years after the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in a May 11 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian e-commerce firm, the filing said. Walmart announced earlier this week that it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart in what is the U.S. retail giant's largest-ever deal and a move to take on arch rival Amazon in a key growth market. The investment implies a valuation of nearly $21 billion for Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart. Minority shareholders after the deal include co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings, U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management and Microsoft. The deal now awaits clearance from India's anti-trust regulator and is expected to close later this year. show chapters What is Flipkart? 8:01 PM ET Wed, 4 April 2018 | 00:56 As part of the deal, Walmart will initially appoint five directors to Flipkart's board, two directors will be named by minority shareholders while Bansal will take one board seat, according to the filing. Walmart said it may, in future, appoint a sixth board member with the approval of the majority of the Flipkart directors. It also said it could appoint or replace Flipkart's chief executive and other key executives of group companies in consultation with Bansal and the board. Walmart or its units could ask Flipkart to issue new ordinary shares of up to $3 billion before the close of the \"transactions and on or before the first anniversary of the closing\", it said. Reuters previously reported that Google-parent Alphabet was in talks to invest about $3 billion for a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart. That deal could be sealed before the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction or immediately after, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the talks are private. Walmart also said no party would be liable to pay a termination fee if a share issuance or purchase agreement with Flipkart were terminated. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Japan's SoftBank Group, which owns a roughly 20 percent stake in Flipkart, was rethinking its exit due to tax liabilities and because it saw further value in Flipkart. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said that their investment in Flipkart had grown to almost $4 billion. That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart. A spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment. Former Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.

In an open letter and invitation to Musk entitled \"Dear Elon,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak on Wednesday defended his questioning. \"Some of these questions can seem dry, boring or short-term focused, but hopefully you can appreciate that anyone looking to invest in Tesla's future must first be comfortable with its present,\" Spak wrote. \"I would be elated to host you for a webcast or call to talk extensively about all the amazing industry innovations you are driving and dispel any investor misconceptions you perceive,\" he added. Tesla declined to comment for this story. Musk, who hosted Tesla's earnings conference call last week to detail the company's quarterly progress, grew frustrated by what he characterized as \"boring, bonehead\" questions from industry analysts. So when Spak later asked Musk for clarification on the company's Model 3 reservations on the call, he didn't get the answer he was looking for. \"We're going to go to YouTube,\" Musk declared. \"These questions are so dry. They're killing me.\" tweet He then took a string of questions from Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old retail investor and owner of a YouTube Channel, who asked the Tesla chief on Twitter if he could be on the earnings call, normally reserved for analysts, professional investors and sometimes, the media. Tesla's shares tumbled the day after the call, but since then have regained much of the losses. To be sure, Spak remains optimistic about the electric car maker, calling Tesla \"an amazing company with a compelling long-term opportunity.\" The analyst currently has a sector perform rating on shares and a 12-month price target of $280, implying 7 percent downside. \"Don't get me wrong. I love talking and thinking about the big picture and what Tesla can become. That's what makes Tesla such a fascinating company,\" Spak wrote. But \"my responsibility is to be well informed when I discuss Tesla's stock with current and potential investors. A financial results call is an opportunity for Wall Street to re-calibrate our expectations.\" While Spak was just one of a few analysts on the receiving end of an exasperated CEO, several Wall Street analysts criticized Musk's behavior on the call, arguing that the shareholders they represent need the gritty details of any company's finances before making investment decisions. Clear results from Tesla are of unusually paramount importance for many on Wall Street who feel the electric car maker is at risk of continuing to miss on its Model 3 production goals. tweet Musk said last summer that Tesla would likely be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by the end of the year, but the company then downgraded those expectations to 2,500 per week. Just last month, Jalopnik.com reported that the company was making 2,000 Model 3s per week as of the end of the first quarter. Aside from the production issues, Wall Street's short sellers \u2013 who have made Tesla the single biggest short on the Street \u2013 likely celebrated a voluntary recall of 123,000 Model S vehicles last month because of an issue with a power-steering component. Still, Musk continues to push back against who have raised concerns about the company's long-term financial outlook. Though some have wondered whether the setbacks will require the company to raise more capital later this year, Musk firmly rebuked that claim last week. Asked last week if he might consider now a good time to raise more money, the CEO simply said \"no.\" Many investors, too, are hoping for a big payoff from the company. Since its initial public offering price of $17 a share in mid-2010, Tesla's stock soared as high as $385 last year before production issues deflated shares to their current $302 level. \u2014CNBC's John Melloy and Robert Ferris contributed reporting.

The bank issued a letter of credit for U.S. food and agriculture firm Cargill. The trade finance transaction involved a bulk shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia. The letter of credit was issued from HSBC to Dutch lender ING. Letters of credit are issued by one bank to another to guarantee that a payment will be received by a seller under a set of conditions. Traditionally this process would take a large amount of time, numerous paper records, and a lot of back and forth between the various parties involved. Blockchain technology promises to change that. Blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, enables transactions to be recorded across a vast network of computers. In the case of bitcoin, it records all of the transactions that happen on the network, creating a public ledger. Banks have taken the principles behind bitcoin's blockchain \u2013 such as the idea of decentralized ledger \u2013 and tried to apply it to processes that they are carrying out. For this transaction, HSBC used a platform developed by blockchain start-up R3 called Corda. R3 works with a consortium of banks to come up with blockchain solutions to a variety of problems. show chapters What is Blockchain? 9:08 AM ET Mon, 4 June 2018 | 04:44 \"The need for paper reconciliation is removed because all parties are linked on the platform and updates are instantaneous,\" Vivek Ramachandran, head of growth and innovation at HSBC, said in a statement. \"The quick turnaround could mean unlocking liquidity for businesses.\" HSBC and ING said that the exchange was performed in 24 hours, compared to the five-to-10 days it normally takes to complete such exchanges through a paper-based system. Proponents of blockchain claim it has the potential to upend various industries. Sectors like trade finance, health care and insurance are thought of as good targets for the use the technology as they rely on long paper trails. While there have been proof-of-concept transactions performed using blockchain technology, HSBC's was the first that could have commercial applications, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. Banks have been pouring money into blockchain projects as it is thought that the technology will significantly disrupt the financial services. While lenders are not fond of the original use case of blockchain \u2014 to underpin cryptocurrency transactions \u2014 many see practical use for the technology because of its ability to handle massive amounts of data within a transparent, immutable network. Last month, Santander teamed up with blockchain firm Ripple to create a foreign exchange service that enables same-day international money transfers.

This included the use of a particular financial product \u2014 the credit default swap \u2014 which fuel-injected a spiral into the Great Recession. Legislators and regulators left sifting through the rubble were forced to accept that their lax approach to policing our financial markets was flawed. To paraphrase philosopher Marshall McLuhan: They drove into the future using only their rearview mirrors. Fortunately, that's changing, especially with regard to credit default swaps. This shift recently prompted regulators to peer around a particularly cumbersome corner of the $13 trillion derivatives market. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently issued a much-needed warning in response to possible manipulation of CDS trades by a couple of the biggest names on Wall Street. While many, justifiably, continue to associate the swaps with crisis-era mortgage mayhem, the product does serve a large and legitimate purpose: allowing businesses and traditional investors to hedge credit risks related to their assets, ranging from agricultural commodities to corporate bonds. For example, a portfolio manager running a fixed-income mutual fund may purchase a CDS linked to a bond issued by a company because it represents \"insurance\" in the event of a bankruptcy. A reliable CDS market can help provide investors with confidence to invest in companies that may otherwise not be able to raise affordable capital. After seeing the trouble caused by past devils in the derivatives market, it's encouraging that the CFTC has been quick to call out potential abuse and manipulation in the CDS marketplace today. In late April, the agency issued a statement related to Blackstone Group's GSO Capital Partners, which was finalizing a deal with homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises to get the perfectly solvent company to intentionally default on a small portion of debt in exchange for sweetheart refinancing terms. Not surprisingly, GSO holds more than $300 million in credit default swaps that would pay out in the event Hovnanian defaults. Hovnanian, which appears to have almost $500 million in its coffers, took the next step when one of its wholly owned subsidiaries waived an interest payment due to itself on bonds it purchased, what people in the market have called a manufactured default. The CFTC sent a message shot across the bow of all devilish CDS market manipulators, warning them not to get even close to manipulation of these products. The agency's statement was clear in saying that manufactured credit events may constitute market manipulation and may severely damage the integrity of the CDS market. Furthermore, the CFTC asserted that it \"will carefully consider all available actions to help ensure market integrity and combat manipulation or fraud.\" Chairman Chris Giancarlo \u2014 who has done a grand job, in my view \u2014 put a fine point on this recently by noting that his staff is also coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is a long-awaited development that will benefit the entire CDS marketplace. As for GSO and Hovnanian, they appear to be ignoring regulators' warnings, but my experience is that they do so at their own peril. In this instance, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association will convene at the end of the month to decide whether the missed interest payments represent a legitimate default by Hovnanian. (CDS buyers cannot collect \"insurance\" payouts unless the association validates them.) Fortunately, the ISDA committee slated to rule on the matter has ample justification to shoot the deal down. For example, it could reasonably infer Hovnanian's subsidiary waived its right to any interest payment once it knowingly purchased securities that it knew were going to be defaulted on as part of the agreement with GSO. The big picture here is that even 10 years later, the lessons of the Great Recession should continue to serve as a clear reminder of what can happen across our markets and, in turn, the broader economy, if nefarious actions by financial devils are allowed to continue. Regulators should be clear and unequivocal \u2014 especially on combating manipulation \u2014 to ensure efficient and effective markets. If they do, it will benefit not only markets, but our economy and our country.

Top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is focusing on a group that has been especially cautious to dive into the volatile market: institutional investors. The San Francisco-based company announced the launch on Tuesday of four new products aimed at that investor class: Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Markets, The Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group and Coinbase Prime. \"We think this can unlock $10 billion of institutional investor money sitting on the sideline,\" said Adam White, vice president and general manager. \"We're seeing a rapid increase in attention awareness and adoption in the cryptocurrency market.\" show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 While bitcoin's 1,300 percent rise to almost $20,000 in 2017 was led by retail investors, the new products could usher in more institutional investors and solve the problems that made many of them wary of the space, White said. Security is one of those issues. Fiat money stored in banks is insured but in cryptocurrency, funds that are lost or stolen have little or no possibility of recovery. Coinbase is looking to be the trusted custodian by launching Coinbase Custody. The company has already stored more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency on behalf of customers through its exchange but until the announcement did not have a separate product to handle that. Coinbase Custody is a partnership with a SEC-regulated broker-dealer that will store cryptocurrency for its clients. Wall Street's interest in cryptocurrency seems to be increasing. There are currently 287 crypto hedge funds, up from 175 in a year earlier, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next. Only 20 hedge funds for cryptocurrency existed in 2016. Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking to open a cryptocurrency trading desk, and White said others will be quick to follow. \"Very few want to be first, but everyone wants to be second,\" he said. \"There will be fast followers.\" The 6-year old company says it has traded $150 billion in assets on its platform and has more than 20 million customers. Last year, it brought in a reported $1 billion in revenue, according to Recode, and has drawn in more than $225 million in funding from the world's top investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and the New York Stock Exchange. Recode also reported that the company valued itself at about $8 billion when it made an offer in its recent acquisition for Earn.com. Coinbase is best-known for its trading platform, which offers bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. It's now offering a separate platform exclusively for institutional investors called Coinbase Prime. \"The feedback we heard from institutional investors was 'Your infrastructure doesn't meet our expectations,'\" White said. \"We heard that loud and clear.\" The new platform will have a separate interface from Coinbase's GDAX exchange but all investors will have access to the same pool of liquidity. Coinbase Markets is the company's new electronic marketplace, which will be run out of an office opening in Chicago. It provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all of the company's products. The fourth product, Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group, was designed for \"white glove\" customer service that institutions like banks are used to. The group will be run out of the New York City office, and will help bring on board new clients and sell the service to additional investors looking to get into crypto. \"This is our public demonstration [that] we are absolutely here to serve institutions investing heavily to do that,\" White said.

However, the cryptocurrency traded near $8,700 Monday, less than half its record high of above $19,000 hit in December. Ethereum traded near $730, down about 45 percent from its record hit earlier this year, according to Coinbase. The coin is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

To be more precise, his time frame is one to two years, or by 2020. As a result, Cox recommended that investors insulate their portfolios with dividend stocks. Names that \"aren't necessarily recession-proof,\" he said. \"But they tend to be resilient.\" \"Mobile services are a perfect example, because the last thing you're going to do during a recession is turn off your phone,\" Cox said. Companies with solid fundamentals are a buying opportunity as interest rates rise and prices drop during sell-offs, he said. \"There's no business condition causing the stocks to fall,\" Cox said. \"It's just the interest rates. So they'll go back up again.\" Some sectors to consider are telecom, utilities and consumer staples, Cox said. He recommended Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, AT&T, Verizon and Procter & Gamble. Cox pointed out that a company like Procter & Gamble was performing badly year to date. \"But people need toothpaste,\" he said. \"Like any other investment,\" Cox said, \"it doesn't necessarily pay off right away. What you're trying to do is build your portfolio for income or whatever you're trying to do for the future.\" On Tuesday, stocks fell, with all major indexes opening lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 200 points, the S&P 500 shed 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite declined 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, hit its highest level since 2011 on Tuesday, at 3.09 percent. In addition, many market watchers fear the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as many as four times this year. The first rate increase in 2018 was after the central bank's March meeting. But Cox said the likelihood of four hikes is small. At some point the positive effects for companies from the Republican tax law are going to wear off and some of those corporations \"are going to stop buying things,\" Cox said. \"That's going to cause a recession or slowdown in the economy.\" He warns investors not to assume, \"stocks are going to stay up forever.\" \"They're not going to,\" Cox said. \"Particularly the high-flying ones.

A group of nuns and other faith-based investors won a shareholder vote at Sturm Ruger & Co. requiring one of the nation's largest gun-makers to prepare a report about the risks of its business. Ruger's CEO, Christopher Killoy, said at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday that the company will comply and prepare the report. \"Shareholders have spoken,\" he said. But, he added, the winning proposal \"cannot force us to change our business,\" and \"cannot change what Ruger is about and what we stand for.\" It was the first major test this year for faith-based shareholder groups, which have been urging the nation's gun industry to act after recent extreme examples of gun violence. These shareholder groups have reached out to big banks and investment firms for their support, an effort that has paid off in this instance. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and Sturm Ruger's largest shareholder because of its giant index fund business, voted its 2.8 million shares in favor of the shareholder proposal, a source told CNBC. Vanguard is the second-largest shareholder, though its vote is unknown. A spokesman wasn't immediately available. show chapters Who makes the AR-15 rifle? 7:01 PM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 02:19 Specifically, the proposal, backed by Catholic Health Initiatives and the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, asks gun makers like Sturm Ruger to prepare a report about the financial and reputational risks associated with their business. The shareholders plan to introduce a similar proposal on the proxy of American Outdoor Brands, another gun-maker that typically holds its meetings in the fall. Two major shareholder voting advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, threw their support behind the proposal, while Sturm Ruger's board had advised against it. Since a February shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead, there has been a surge of activism to stop further gun violence, involving a range of constituents, from the high school students who survived that shooting to major banks, retailers and investment firms. \"A new momentum has emerged over these last few months,\" said Colleen Scanlon, the chief advocacy officer of Catholic Health Initiatives, who was present at the meeting to introduce the proposal. \"It's so significant that a majority of shareholders are asking their company to consider gun safety.\" BlackRock said in a note to clients in March that it would reach out to gun-makers to try to get them to talk about their business, and it added it could use its position as a major shareholder to vote against directors and in favor of shareholder proposals. Sturm Ruger's Killoy said during the meeting, which was webcast from Prescott, Arizona, that the company, as a policy, does not meet individually with shareholders.

The tech giant announced on Tuesday that it is working with Veridium Labs, a firm that creates environment-related cryptocurrencies, to make it easier to trade carbon credits using blockchain technology. Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, is most popularly known as the tech that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It enables participants to register transactions across a vast network of computers. But, increasingly, firms in other sectors are showing an interest in distributed ledger because of its ability to handle massive amounts of data within a transparent, immutable network. Veridium will use IBM's technology to issue and manage carbon credit-backed tokens on the blockchain network created by Stellar, another start-up IBM has been working with. IBM said the carbon credit tokens will be fungible, meaning that they can be exchanged for another asset of the same type. What are carbon credits? Carbon credits are permits that allow governments and other organizations to emit a limited amount of carbon dioxide with the aim of reducing their carbon footprint. The certificates limit emissions to the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide. While environmental credits are already traded, IBM and Veridium said that the current structure of the market creates too much friction. \"Right now, if you look at the carbon credit market \u2014 specifically the voluntary carbon credit market \u2014 they're traded through bilateral agreements which means there's a lot of friction involved,\" Jared Klee, director of digital asset registry at IBM, told CNBC in a phone call. \"They're not fungible assets, you see that in pricing that one can be very different, the same asset with large price fluctuations between two of them. And we see that reflected in other places like secondary volumes and what not.\" show chapters World Bank's Roome: You can still grow your economy by pricing carbon 10:25 AM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 | 01:55 The initial carbon credit tokens will include Triple-Gold Certified REDD+ credits from InfiniteEARTH, a company owned by Veridium's parent organization EnVision. IBM and Veridium also plan to eventually let traders hedge potential environmental impacts using the blockchain platform, Klee said. IBM's bet on blockchain Big Blue partnered with blockchain start-up Stellar in 2017 on a payments platform that uses the latter's lumens tokens to rapidly clear and settle cross-border payments. Several cryptocurrencies, including Stellar's, shot up in value late last year, with bitcoin's price coming close to nearly $20,000 a coin. Stellar's cryptocurrency is currently the eighth-largest in terms of market value, according to industry website CoinMarketCap. Rather than functioning as a cryptocoin like bitcoin, Stellar's digital token lets users exchange government-backed currencies. But IBM has said is not interested in the cryptocurrency aspect of blockchain technology. IBM's blockchain is permissioned, meaning it only allows a limited number of trusted parties to access it. This is different to bitcoin's blockchain, which lets any user access it. The company has been investing heavily in the technology, forging partnerships with the likes of Walmart and Nestle on tracing food contamination, and creating a joint venture with shipping giant Maersk on trade.

The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice that includes a $4.9 billion civil penalty to resolve potential claims over mortgage-backed securities issued from 2005 to 2008. The bank said in a statement that $3.46 billion of the proposed penalty will be covered by existing provisions, with the rest to come from an incremental charge of $1.44 billion in 2018's second quarter. Both the bank and the U.S. Attorney's office in Massachusetts, which first announced the deal, said more negotiations were needed before a formal agreement could be reached. The implosion of markets for risky residential mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed. RBS said the proforma impact of the proposed settlement on the bank's March 31, 2018 Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is a reduction of about 50 basis points and a reduction of 9p on March 31 2018 fully diluted TNAV per share. \"Adjusting for the combined impact of both the RMBS settlement and the pension deficit contribution of \u00fa2 billion announced on 17 April, the Q1 2018 pro forma CET1 is 15.1 percent and fully diluted TNAV is 274p,\" the RBS statement said. RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in the statement that when the agreement is finalised, it would allow RBS \"to deal with this significant remaining legacy issue and is the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.\" A conference call for investors and analysts is planned for 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) in London on Thursday, the statement said. RBS reached a $500 million settlement with New York state in March to resolve charges it misled investors who bought the mortgage-backed bonds. Last December, it also agreed to pay $125 million to resolve claims that it made misrepresentations while selling mortgage-backed securities to two large California pension funds. RBS was one of the last banks to reach a settlement with the U.S. government to resolve investigations into its marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The investigation had been led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts, which had also been conducting a criminal probe into the company and former employees. But the settlement that RBS and the office disclosed on Thursday was only civil in nature, signaling no criminal charges were likely to result from the probe. The Justice Department had previously settled with banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Barclays.

BKC traded little changed Wednesday morning near $25.14 a share.

The firm's chief investment strategist says he wouldn't be surprised if stocks soon retest this year's correction lows due to rising inflation. \"You're seeing more and more evidence that inflation has changed its stripes and is headed higher,\" Paulsen said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"What we're doing, as a result, is being forced to readjust interest rates and ultimately price-earnings multiples in stocks.\" His thoughts came Wednesday as the 10-Year Treasury yield hit 3.014 percent \u2014 its highest level since April 26. The 2-Year Treasury yield is also ticking higher, fluttering around September 2008 levels. It's a textbook side effect of a maturing economic cycle with full employment, according to Paulsen. Stocks may have taken higher yields in stride on Wednesday, but he believes it's a temporary reaction. \"Margin erosion is starting to raise its ugly head a bit with some of the companies that have reported [earnings,]\" he added. \"We're going to see more of that with both labor and capital costs rising and commodity prices rising. You're going to see more companies experiencing erosion of margins, which could force Wall Street to lower estimates.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. If investors aren't positioned right, Paulsen said, the damage could be downright painful. He expects the S&P 500 to end the year flat or slightly lower from current levels. But he has a game plan to weather a correction-prone market. \"You can move away from the United States. I don't think overseas markets have nearly the issues that we have here,\" he said, adding that a commodity ETF, hedge fund exposure and capital goods sectors as places for portfolio protection. Paulsen is also advocating cash as an option. \"The Federal Reserve is paying a little money on that now, and you might as well take advantage of it,\" he said. \"If the market does hit another air pocket again, then you can use some of that cash and maybe the commodity ETF to go back in a bigger way towards equities.\" He may have a cautious outlook, but he doesn't believe stocks have entered a bear market. Paulsen has been referring to 2018 as a \"re-evaluation year.\" \"I am not convinced the bull [market] is over. I think this is more a pause, and maybe restart again in 2019.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Board agreed there was not a \"strong case\" for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy, Tuesday's six-page minutes showed. The Board still agrees the next move was more likely up than down, assuming the economy gathered momentum as expected. The RBA last cut rates to 1.5 percent in August 2016, notching up the longest period without a change in modern history. Financial markets are wagering this steady spell could last well into 2019. Crucially, wage growth and inflation has undershot expectations for some years and showed little sign of heating up soon. Data due Wednesday is likely to show wage growth stayed near all-time lows at an annual 2.1 percent in the quarter-ended March, even as brisk job gains are expected on Thursday. RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech ahead of Tuesday's minutes that Australia's wage growth has \"troughed\" and there are some tentative signs of pressure emerging. However, there is a risk it may take a lower unemployment rate than currently expected to generate a sustained move higher, he added. Australia's jobless rate has remained stubbornly stuck around 5.5 percent and levels of underemployment \u2014 those already working but wanting more hours \u2014 are near historical highs, a major factor weighing on wages. Indeed, the RBA expects the unemployment rate to stay there by year-end. It is seen ticking lower to 5.25 percent by 2020. \"Stronger (economic) growth was expected over the following couple of years, which could reduce spare capacity in the economy and lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate,\" the RBA said. \"The increase in wages growth and inflation was expected to be gradual however because spare capacity in the economy was expected to be reduced only slowly.\" Policymakers remained upbeat about the outlook for Australia's A$1.8 trillion economy, expecting activity to pick-up to a little above 3 percent over the next two years after a somewhat disappointing 2.4 percent outcome last year. Household consumption, which has been a key area of uncertainty over the past year, had grown \"solidly\" last year, the RBA said, adding recent data on retail and motor vehicle sales suggested the momentum has continued in early 2018. The RBA said stricter lending criteria by banks had helped in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets.

Addressing a key criticism of bitcoin and its growing list of competitors, Cathy Bessant, BofA's chief technical officer, said it's important to differentiate the two major uses of digital currencies. \"As a payment system, I think it's troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it's] designed to be not transparent,\" Bessant said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" That makes it more difficult to police business transactions in cyberspace. \"The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money,\" she said, speaking from CNBC's Capital Exchange breakfast series in Washington, D.C. \"Cryptos is the antithesis of that.\" On the other hand, BofA's customers are free to choose to invest in bitcoin if they so wish. The space has been highly volatile, with bitcoin in particular soaring to nearly $20,000 in 2017 before falling drastically. On Thursday morning, it was at $9,340. One thing they can't do, though, is use a Bank of America credit cards to speculate in the crypto world. \"Just like we don't allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we're not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards,\" Bessant said. Broadly speaking, Bessant said bank security is improving. \"I do actually think we're in a better position every day,\" she said. \"Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we're in a better place.\" However, she said the perception of some data thieves as modern-day Robin Hoods poses a problem. Using the good guy-bad guy analogy again, she said during a chat with CNBC's Kayla Tausche that the relationship is clear with someone robbing a bank, but less so with someone stealing data. \"Often times the hacker or the person who causes the leak and steals the data are considered heroic,\" Bessant said. \"We put Julian Assange on the cover of a magazine and call him person of the year, and yet WikiLeaks is in the business of stealing data.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/18/104905613-GettyImages-894537888.jpg?v=1525954477", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Catherine Bessant"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "10"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "01:11"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bank of America"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Cathy Bessant"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "two"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bessant"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Squawk Box"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Capital Exchange"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Washington"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "D.C."}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Cryptos"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "nearly $20,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "Thursday morning"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "9,340"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "One"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bank of America"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bessant"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bessant"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "every day"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Awareness"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "every day"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "modern-day"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Robin Hoods"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kayla Tausche"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Bessant"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Julian Assange"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "WikiLeaks"}], "description": "Cryptocurrencies are standing in the way of authorities catching \"bad guys\" who are using payment systems for nefarious purposes, Bank of America's Cathy Bessant says.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/bitcoin-as-a-payment-system-is-troubling-bofa-tech-officer-says.html", "author": "Anthony Wallace | AFP | Getty Images", "title": "Cryptocurrencies as a payment system are 'troubling,"}, {"time": "2018-05-10T16:38:12-0400", "body": " show chapters AXA Equitable CEO on IPO 11:16 AM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 | 03:55 Axa's $15.3 billion takeover of global property casualty firm XL Group was a monster deal in the insurance world, but Paris-based Axa's plan to pay for the acquisition has come up short. The French company is selling its U.S. business, Axa Equitable Holdings, in an initial public offering. But the money it raised was about $1 billion less than the goal. The IPO priced at $20 a share, below the expected $24 to $27 per share range. It opened trading at $19.75 on Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EQH. It closed at $20.34, up 1.7 percent. At $2.75 billion in proceeds, the deal is still the largest U.S. IPO of the year, according to Renaissance Capital. But it was far less than the $3.7 billion it had expected to raise at the high end of the pricing range. Insurers have been a beaten-down sector this year. Principal Financial shares are down more than 17 percent, while shares of Prudential Financial and Lincoln National are both down more than 12 percent, and shares of MetLife have fallen 7.7 percent.

But with Duperreault and a new team at the helm, AIG's Property and Casualty insurance should be able to find its footing. In addition to upgrading his rating on shares to buy from neutral, Meredith set the company's price target at $65, implying 21 percent upside over the next 12 months.

The behavior of the Australian dollar is one of those contradictions. On the one hand the Australian market is making new 10 year highs. This is generally taken as a sign of economic strength. Its particularly important for Australia where the market has been trapped in a prolonged sideways movement for more than a year while the rest of the world in the US and Asia have been streaking ahead. On the other hand, the Australian dollar has broken a long term uptrend and is rapidly moving towards 12-month, and potentially, two-year lows. The Australian Reserve bank is celebrating because they have been aiming for a lower dollar as a matter of principle. The last time the Australian market was trading near the current highs, the Aussie was trading at $0.81 rather than heading for a low of $0.715. The last time the AUD traded around $0.715 the Australian index was at a low near 4750. This is the contradiction \u2014 the falling Australian dollar and the Australian market making new 10-year highs. Interesting, but irrelevant, or significant? The answer lies in the speed of both moves. Once the AUD uptrend line was broken near $0.765 it has taken less than 3 weeks to touch $0.74. The AUD chart is defined by trading bands. The lower edge of the trading band is near $0.74. The upper edge near $0.775. The breakout above $0.775 had a target near $0.81. This was achieved. A fall below $0.74 has a downside target near $0.715. This is calculated by taking the width of the trading band and projecting it downwards. The speed of the rally in the Australian Index is equally astounding. In six weeks it has rallied from near 5750 to 6150. This is a very fast market rally and rallies of this nature are unsustainable. This is an exceptionally fast flow of money into the market and a good example of irrational exuberance as there are limited sound fundamentals to support this confidence. The trajectory of the Aussie dollar suggests the way this contradiction may be resolved with the Aussie market moving back into sync with the Aussie dollar. That's not to say we are looking at a trend change, but traders are alert for evidence of consolidation and a pullback in the Australian market particularly if the Aussie dollar fails to hold support near $0.74.

The move comes as China cracks down on speculative trading in the cryptocurrency market. Beijing banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) \u2014 a form of fundraising for cryptocurrency start-ups \u2014 last year, and has closed down domestic bitcoin exchanges. \"Cryptocurrencies have recently expanded the human understanding of digital economy at a large scale,\" Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei Mobile Services, said in a statement Friday. \"From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.\" Chesnot | Getty Images Digital cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethernum, Dash, Monero and Litecoin. BTC.com said in a statement that it was difficult for Chinese consumers to have access to a cryptocurrency app of any kind as Google's app store is blocked in China. The firm's wallet only supports bitcoin and an offshoot of the world's largest cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. Huawei's AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones and will be rolled out to other devices in the second quarter. People in China are projected to spend more time on their smartphones and other mobile devices than watching television for the first time this year, according to research by eMarketer. Mobile payments are hugely popular in the country, with homegrown companies like Alibaba's Ant Financial and JD.com's JD Finance providing digital payments and lending services. Huawei is the world's second largest phone manufacturer, according to Counterpoint Research. But the firm has come under increased scrutiny in the U.S., with top intelligence chiefs accusing it of having the ability to spy on consumers. It has struggled to find a carrier in the U.S. that will allow it to sell its phones.

Mester said she does not expect inflation to pick up sharply, adding that while it is close to the Fed's symmetric 2 percent target, it will only reach that level on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. \"We want to give inflation time to move back to goal ... this argues against a steep path,\" she said. The Fed unanimously decided to raise borrowing costs at its policy meeting in March. It forecasts another two rate rises for this year, although an increasing number of policymakers see three as a possibility. Policymakers raised rates three times last year. The Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate now sits in a target range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation increased to 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March, effectively bringing price gains to the central bank's 2 percent target after undershooting that goal in recent years. Mester, who has a vote on monetary policy this year under a rotation system, also said the central bank could raise rates more rapidly if the U.S. economy grew faster than expected, though she added it could go slower if inflation weakens again. Her views are consistent with the Fed's policy statement earlier this month. It emphasized that policymakers do not see their 2 percent inflation target as a ceiling, and will not be unduly concerned with price gains above it for a time. Mester also used her speech to a central banking conference to once again reiterate her stance that the central bank should begin to analyze whether its inflation framework is fit for the future. \"Now is the time to assess whether changes to our current framework could make monetary policy more effective in achieving our goals,\" she said. Several others on the Fed's rate-setting committee have also called for a review this year on whether to stick to the current inflation policy, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has yet to publicly show support for such a move. Investors have fully priced in a rate rise at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 12-13.

Paul Hickey, who runs independent research firm Bespoke Investment Group, says WTI crude is surging in an atmosphere that isn't normally conducive for such big gains. \"We've seen a real big rally in crude oil here off the lows,\" Hickey said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"The dollar over that same period is up about 5 percent, and as you know, like oil and water, oil and the dollar typically don't mix.\" Yet, crude has still managed to rally nearly 15 percent over the past six weeks. Hickey calls it an \"impressive trend\" in an inhospitable environment. But that doesn't mean it hasn't happened before. \"When we looked back at these prior periods in the market when you see these simultaneous rallies, crude oil has had a little bit better-than-average returns. The energy stocks have done really well going forward as well as the overall stock market,\" Hickey said. He highlights the S&P 500 energy index as an area giving Wall Street strong profits. \"It's one of the most extended sectors in the short term, further above its 50-day moving average than any other group. And, it's closer to a 52-week high than any other sector,\" he said. But according to Hickey, that doesn't imply oil prices have become too expensive and will stall. \"If you look at the relative strength of the energy sector going back to 1980, it's still very depressed and right near 14-year lows,\" Hickey said. \"Longer term, energy has got a very deep hole to dig itself out of.\" Crude oil hit an oil time high of $147.27 a barrel on July 11, 2008.

Since early 2016, Square Cash app downloads have averaged 128 percent year-over-year growth each month versus Venmo's 74 percent, according to a Nomura analysis. With roughly 28 million cumulative downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads is just 1 million below Venmo's levels, analyst Dan Dolev said. \"Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017,\" Dolev said in a note to clients Wednesday, reiterating his buy rating on the stock. The app appears to be getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, the analyst noted. \"With Square Cash App now open for Bitcoin trading in most states, comparing its growth versus the popular Coinbase app is noteworthy,\" he added. \"Here, while Coinbase saw growth peak around the holiday time \u2014 as Bitcoin prices spiked \u2014 Coinbase's growth has slowed from record levels, whereas Square Cash App experienced more balanced growth.\" Dolev has consistently lauded Square Cash as a potential revenue driver for the payment company. His 12-month stock price target of $65 implies more than 18 percent upside over the next year. Though Square said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter, it initially spent $33.9 million to purchase the cryptocurrency, netting a final adjusted revenue of just $200,000. Shares of Square were up 1.9 percent Wednesday morning. Despite issuing guidance that fell short of Wall Street's expectations earlier this month, Square has outperformed the broader stock market over the past year, up 57 percent since January and 168 percent year over year. In its first-quarter earnings report earlier in May, the payments company said it will continue to reinvest, focusing on revenue growth over profit expansion. \"Given the significant market opportunity ahead of us, we will continue to reinvest in our business to drive future growth,\" it said in a statement this month.

Malaysia said it will introduce a sales and service tax (SST) to partly offset the shortfall in revenue from effectively scrapping a goods and service tax (GST) from June. The Mahathir Mohamad-led government, which won last week's general election, said on Wednesday it would lower GST to zero percent from June 1. Ousted leader Najib Razak had introduced the tax in 2015 amid lower oil prices. In a statement on Thursday, the ministry of finance said the shortfall in revenue will be supported by specific revenue and expenditure measures that will be announced soon, including the reintroduction of the sales and services tax. \"Fiscal reform is being implemented. Expenditure reduction will begin with rationalisation and efficiency measures and reducing leakages,\" the statement said. It did not say when the sales tax will be introduced. Brian Tan, a Singapore-based economist with Nomura, said the timing of SST implementation was a concern. \"It is a question of how quickly you can bring (the SST)back. In the intervening period of the removal of GST and the return of SST, there is obviously going to be a gap in revenue. The question is how long and large will that gap be,\" he said. The finance ministry statement also added that rising oil prices will provide short-term fiscal space. \"No doubt (the higher oil price) is helpful but the problem is that it may not be enough.

But the bond market has historically been a vast but old-fashioned corner of the financial system, with little transparency and trading often conducted by phone. Yet a confluence of factors is now beginning to have a profound impact on the $50tn fixed income market. Banks complain that more onerous regulations have hamstrung their ability to play their traditional role in lubricating activity in the bond market. That has spurred efforts to explore new ways to trade debt. The hope is that modernising the market's technological architecture can cut costs and improve its efficiency. The \"electronification\" of the bigger government debt markets \u2014 such as US Treasuries or UK Gilts \u2014 is already well under way, and some experts predict that less traded markets such as corporate, municipal or emerging market debt will be the next to succumb to the march of the machines. There is still scepticism that bonds can ever trade in a similar fashion to equities. Doubters point out that a company might only have issued one stock, but dozens of unique bonds. In fact, there are only 43,000 stocks in the world, but there are millions of bonds, each with their own legal and financial idiosyncrasies. Bigger chunks of debt are especially hard to trade without human finesse: sceptics compare it to how people might be comfortable buying a TV online, but not a house. But if modern regulations have plunged bond trading into a funk, then modern technology has handed the finance industry the means to turn the predicament into an opportunity. Stocks may be fundamentally different from fixed income, but that does not mean the latter cannot benefit from advances in data science and artificial intelligence. Moreover, electronification is just one facet of how bond trading is being dragged into the 21st century, with banks and investors exploring myriad ways to modernise the entire fixed income market \u2014 as Abbie attests to. \"Before the crisis the technology available was pretty archaic. But the liquidity available was so good that we didn't care. Then 2008 happened,\" says Douglas Peebles, AllianceBernstein's fixed income chief. \"We want to make the market better, stronger, faster.\" When Richie Prager started on Wall Street in 1981 he had to punch trades into a Telex machine, the keys so cumbersome it felt like they were fighting back. The majority of bond deals were arranged by phone and trading floors resembled boisterous street markets. Today Mr Prager oversees trading at BlackRock, the world's biggest investment group, where quiet data scientists have replaced many bellowing traders, and workstations look more like a desk at Nasa. \"The technology [change] is like night and day over the past five years,\" Mr Prager says. \"It's hugely exciting.\" BlackRock is one of several firms that are pouring money into technology in order to cut costs and improve the efficiency of its bond trading operations \u2014 a trend catalysed by concerns over the health of the bond market. While debt issuance has surged, traders say liquidity has deteriorated sharply in recent years, as a torrent of regulations forced banks to reduce their trading desks. Putting precise numbers around this decline is tricky, as liquidity is an ephemeral concept. Asking a dozen traders will typically yield at least as many answers. But broadly speaking, liquidity is how easy it is to trade a financial asset without significantly moving its price. Most experts agree that liquidity has atrophied for bonds \u2014 especially at times of stress in the market. That has led to a series of warnings over the years. Blackstone chief Stephen Schwarzman has argued that the \"liquidity drought can exacerbate, or even trigger, the next financial crisis\", while the economist Nouriel Roubini has predicted that \"market illiquidity will eventually trigger a bust and collapse\". Even regulators have voiced concerns, albeit in more cautious terms. Thus far the doomsayers might seem like Eeyore, AA Milne's permanently pessimistic donkey, as fixed income markets have weathered big tests without any significant dislocations. Yet even if a crisis has failed to materialise, that does not mean the bond market is in fine fettle. And a number of banks and investment groups think that part of the solution will lie in the modernisation of fixed income trading. This has accelerated the shift towards electronic, equity-style trading on exchanges, as opposed to \"over the counter\" trading. The \"rates\" market, where the debt of major governments is traded, is already mostly electronic, and corporate debt is also beginning to migrate on to trading platforms \u2014 at least for smaller chunks of debt. There are also signs that the traditional divide between the \"dealer-to-dealer\" bond market, where banks trade with each other, and the \"dealer-to-client\" area, where they arrange trades for other investors, is beginning to blur, with some experts heralding the dawn of an \"all-to-all\" market for the biggest, most liquid bond markets. Greenwich Associates estimates that a fifth of all investment-grade US corporate bond trades are now done electronically \u2014 almost double the volume of a decade ago. Even riskier \"junk bonds\" are beginning to move that way. One of the biggest winners from this shift is MarketAxess, the largest electronic bond trading forum, which has seen the average monthly volume of bonds traded across its platform more than double since 2014 to nearly $150bn in 2018. \"There's a secular trend towards more electronic trading globally,\" says Rick McVey, the company's chief executive. Banks have also begun to automate smaller bond trades to free up traders for the bigger deals that still require a human touch. For example, Goldman Sachs' \"bond pricing engine\" calculates values for 10,000 bonds every day, allowing its algorithms to handle smaller trades. At first the \" Goldman Sachs Algorithm \" only handled trades below $500,000, but today anything below $2m \"doesn't get touched by a human\", according to Justin Gmelich, a senior executive at the investment bank. \"In four-five years I wouldn't be surprised if we have a lower trader headcount, and have more staff on the algorithmic side,\" he adds. Yet modernising bond market trading is just one aspect of a much broader, seismic shift. Even sceptics concede there is a panoply of other areas where modern data science and computing can deliver valuable improvements. \"People are focusing a lot on efficiency,\" says Steve Zamsky, chief operating officer for fixed income at Morgan Stanley. \"The conversation has been transformed from talking about electronification of corporate debt trading to increasing the efficiency of the ecosystem across the board.\" Take AllianceBernstein's Abbie. Although primarily an order management algorithm built into the asset manager's messaging system, its success in automating the humdrum work of sizing and organising trades has fed optimism that it will be able to perform more significant tasks. By combining Abbie with the bond pricing and trading platform Alfa and research platform Prism, AllianceBernstein hopes the combined trio can become a virtual fund manager. \"It's only been two years that we've embraced the potential of technology, and what we've achieved in a short period of time is phenomenal,\" says Jim Switzer, head of credit trading at AllianceBernstein. \"The bond market is going to look radically different in three years' time.\" Disruption is also coming to bank \"syndication\" desks, which arrange and sell new debt sales by companies and countries. The author Michael Lewis once described syndication desks as an \"omniscient, omnipotent, omnivorous presence\" on trading floors, but banks are working on new digital platforms to overhaul a process that has long consisted of phone calls, emails, instant messaging services and unwieldy spreadsheets to collect and collate the orders. Even mobile phones are coming into play. JPMorgan surveyed more than 400 fixed income traders at investment groups last autumn, and 61 per cent said they were \"extremely\" or \"somewhat\" likely to use a mobile trading app in 2018, up from 31 per cent the year before. \"We want salespeople and traders focused on selling and trading, rather than spending time on the clunky bits we can automate,\" says Guy America, head of credit trading at JPMorgan. Underscoring the sense of a tipping point, the US Securities and Exchange Commission last year established an advisory committee on fixed income's market structure, made up of big money managers, exchanges, borrowers and bankers. This was a vital development, says Amar Kuchinad, head of strategy at Trumid, a new bond trading platform and one of the committee's members. \"Regulatory attention was what really drove innovation in the equity market,\" he says. \"Evolution is a process. Sometimes it feels so slow that you don't appreciate how much has changed [in fixed income] already.\" But the regulatory interest also highlights concerns over the evolving bond market. Technological disruption can often be painful, and lead to unwanted side-effects. As bond markets become faster and more algorithmic, they will also likely become more prone to the glitches that have plagued equity markets in recent years. A vivid example of this came on October 15 2014, when the 10-year US Treasury bond yield suddenly tumbled and then roared higher again, a 37-basis point intraday move so sharp that in theory it should only be expected once every 1.6bn years. The mayhem was enabled by the advent of faster, algorithmic traders in the US Treasury market who have stepped into the breach left by retreating banks. Similar \"flash events\" could become more prevalent across fixed income as automated trading becomes more widespread, the Bank for International Settlement said in a 2016 report. \"Given the importance of fixed income markets for the funding of the real economy and financial stability more broadly, policymakers have a strong interest in assessing how electronification may be affecting market quality,\" the report said. However, bankers and investors argue that yearning for the pre-crisis golden years of bond trading is pointless. \"People inherently don't like change, but some of these trends have taken root,\" Mr Prager says. \"We are not going back.\" More from the Financial Times: Gina Haspel pledges not to restart CIA torture programme Novartis admits $1.2m in payments to Trump lawyer Argentines shocked by

On a call with analysts Tuesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger said, \"with more than $1.3 billion in box office to date, 'Black Panther' makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk-taking and the value of inclusion. We're proud of this movie on so many levels. It speaks volumes about great innovative storytelling, the power of new perspectives and unbridled creativity.\" With \"Black Panther\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" Iger said the Disney studio has delivered nine of the top 10 biggest domestic box-office openings of all time, all of them released in the last six years. show chapters Disney now has 9 of the 10 biggest U.S. box office openings 10:33 AM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 | 02:25 Many analysts characterized the strong box-office results as a budding opportunity for the company, while others said the media and entertainment giant \"fired on all cylinders.\" Disney posted fiscal second-quarter earnings per share of $1.84 adjusted (versus $1.70 expected) and revenue of $14.55 billion (versus $14.11 billion expected). Here's what Wall Street's analysts wrote about Disney's results: Morgan Stanley \"The results showcase the strong profit growth potential of Disney's intellectual property-driven segments (Film, Parks) as well as highlight notable improvement at core Media Networks despite some modest dilution from over-the-top investments. Parks and Film led second fiscal quarter segment operating income growth well ahead of expectations. Media Nets revenues accelerated, with subscriber trends moving in the right direction and broadcast ad sales better than feared.\" Wells Fargo \"Disney continues to execute, with FQ2 beating everywhere but Consumer Products. The highlight was clearly 'Black Panther,' but Parks and Media Networks weren't too shabby. We do think the \"incremental $50 million\" of investment spend at BAMTech is taking away from what we consider to be a really nice print \u2013 we are raising our full year F'18E EPS estimate to $7.08 from $6.97. We reiterate our Outperform and $135 price target.\" Evercore \"Disney's outlook for the year improves based on a F2Q18 beat which was driven by continued momentum at the Studio and by the Parks & Resorts division, which continues to be a juggernaut. While a few factors which could lead to near-term pressures at the Media Networks segment, today's earnings release showed a number of encouraging trends across most of the company's businesses ... attendance spending and margin trends at the Parks & Resorts continued to outpace our expectations; Black Panther put Studio Entertainment up solidly in the double-digits on both revenue and operating income.\" Jefferies \"Disney posted its cleanest quarter in a while with strong growth across the key business segments. However, with the headlines around the potential looming Comcast offer for FOX, the stock appears to be in a holding pattern, with the market focusing on game theory rather than fundamentals.\" Barclays \"Disney delivered a strong quarter coming better than expectations across almost all segments on both revenues and operating income. The only exception to this was consumer product, which has now been coming in below expectations almost every quarter for the last couple of years.The biggest portion of the beat on operating income and revenue came from studio followed by parks. These have been consistent outperformers for Disney over the last few years and given the slate in 2018 and beyond, as well as the all-time high margins at Parks, this outperformance appears set to continue.\" RBC Capital Markets \"F2Q18 results fired on all cylinders. Disney is making huge strategic investments while growing at a strong clip. M&A uncertainty is much ado about the short-term ... About as pretty a quarter as they get ... Revenues of $14.55 billion were 3 percent ahead with Parks and Studio as the biggest contributors to upside. Segment operating income of $4.24 billion was an impressive 11 percent ahead of the street. Media Networks had a good quarter, Parks had a great quarter and Studio had a stellar quarter. ESPN also had another quarter of modest improvement in sub declines. Sounds good, no?\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Christine Wang contributed to this report.

But making it more widely available just encouraged ... more gambling. \"The easier it's made, the more people will gamble,\" Buffett said. \"When a government makes it easy for people to take their Social Security checks and start pulling handles or participating in lotteries or whatever it may be, it's a pretty cynical act.\" Humans have a natural tendency for thrill-seeking, and that may be why gambling appeals to many, the Oracle of Omaha acknowledged.

In February, it rolled out cryptocurrency trading for bitcoin and ethereum that's now available in 10 states through \"Robinhood Crypto.\" \"Crypto has certainly added to our growth,\" Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO, told CNBC on a phone interview. \"In the next couple of years, I think you'll see Robinhood looking like a full-service consumer finance company.\" The start-up's products, which have done $150 billion in volume since their introduction, tend to cater to the \"millennial\" population, roughly ages 18 to 35. The demographic is often considered a challenge for traditional financial institutions to reach, and Robinhood is trying to attract the group by offering commission-free trading through an app. The company generates revenue by taking a tiny fraction of a cent per dollar from each trade order as well as collecting interest on customer deposits. In September 2016, the start-up launched a paid subscription service called Robinhood Gold. \"I think the rate at which more traditional tech companies are disrupting finance is interesting to see,\" Bhatt said. \"As it stands we're leading the pack, we're excited about accelerating that.\" For cryptocurrency trading, Robinhood has no investment minimums or maximums and no withdrawal limits. The Menlo Park, California-based company holds most of the digital coins offline, in what is known as \"cold storage,\" to prevent hackers from stealing the coins.

Based on market activity and robust first-quarter earnings, CFRA's Sam Stovall says investors are experiencing fear and greed \u2014 simultaneously. \"Earnings are coming in much, much better than expected,\" the firm's chief investment strategist said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"They're worried that 'yes, earnings growth is good. But if it ends up being too good, that's going to end up being a peak. And now, I have to worry about it getting worse from this point forward.'\" The overwhelming fear is that ultra-strong results could be a warning sign that the bull market is ending. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. However, Stovall doesn't share that sentiment in his note: \"A Peak Is No Reason To Panic.\" \"EPS [earnings per share] growth for Q1 2018 is nearly 600 basis points higher than end-of-quarter estimates, but history implies that a peak in EPS growth does not translate to panic that this bull will soon come to a screeching halt,\" Stovall wrote. \"Indeed in more than 70% of observations since WWII, the S&P 500 rose in price nine months after a peak in 12-month GAAP EPS growth.\" Despite a maturing bull market, Stovall contends the odds are against a pivot into bear territory even if another deep sell-off wipes out more value. \"Essentially, what we're saying is stay the course. This correction might not be over quite yet, but we don't see it morphing into a new bear market,\" he said. Stovall's forecast calls for the S&P 500 to end 2018 at 2,900, an 8 percent rise from current levels. He expects most of the year's gains to happen later in the year, citing uncertainty related to the November midterm elections. \"I call myself a bull with a lower case 'b,'\" Stovall said.

Malaysia, under former Prime Minister Najib Razak, had classified the audit report in 2016 under the Officials Secrets Act when the fund's financial troubles were being investigated. Reports had emerged by that time that about $700 million from 1MDB had gone to Najib's personal bank accounts. Najib denied any wrongdoing and the attorney general cleared him following local investigations. After Najib lost last week's election, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he would reopen investigations into 1MDB and declassify the audit report. He barred Najib and his wife from leaving the country, and has replaced the attorney general who cleared Najib. \"In several instances, the 1MDB management had presented incomplete or inaccurate information to the 1MDB board before an important decision was made and had taken action without the approval of the 1MDB board,\" according to the audit report's executive summary seen by Reuters. Auditor General Madinah Mohamad verified the authenticity of the report seen by Reuters. 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between 2009 and 2015, several decisions involving high-value investments were made through 1MDB board resolutions without detailed discussion or evaluation, the report said. Several high-risk investments were made in a very short time, and the 1MDB management went against the board's and the shareholders' wishes in some instances, it said. \"There were also instances where the 1MDB management gave inaccurate or different information to interested parties,\" the report said. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed civil lawsuits alleging that over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials and their associates. The lawsuits seek to seize about $1.7 billion in assets, including a luxury yacht and paintings, that were bought with 1MDB funds.

US companies from JPMorgan Chase to eBay have come under fire from shareholder groups for trying to neuter a burgeoning campaign to strengthen investor oversight of management. A corporate governance movement to make it easier for shareholders to call special meetings, by lowering the required level of investor support, has gathered momentum in the past year. But companies have begun fighting back with what campaigners say amounts to a spoiler tactic designed to thwart their efforts. JPMorgan won support for the status quo in a contentious vote earlier this week, and the issue is set for another showdown at eBay later this month. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The ability of shareholders to call special meetings is a powerful weapon for investors who want to oust directors or force other changes at listed companies outside of the regular schedule of annual meetings. While the right is exercised only rarely, campaigners say the mere threat can be enough to pressure companies to respond to investor demands. Examples include Allergan, where activist Bill Ackman demanded such a meeting during a hostile takeover battle. Shareholders have filed formal proposals to make it easier to call special meetings at a record 61 US-listed companies this year, according to the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions. Last year, 24 proposals were filed and attracted an unusually high average shareholder backing of 42 per cent. \"It's being watched closely,\" said Peter Kimball, head of advisory at ISS Corporate Solutions. At JPMorgan, Kenneth Steiner \u2014 one of the most prolific sponsors of shareholder proposals \u2014 called on the bank to accede to future demands for a special meeting if 10 per cent of shareholders wanted one. But the bank responded that \"a small minority of shareholders should not be entitled to utilise the mechanism of special meetings for their own interests\" and also that there were \"significant costs\" associated with such events. At its annual meeting in Texas this week, JPMorgan sought \"ratification\" of existing its rules, which require 20 per cent backing among shareholders before a special meeting can be held. By putting forward its own motion, the bank was able to omit Mr Steiner's proposal from the ballot. Similarly, the S&P 500 lender Capital One put forward a proposal at its annual meeting earlier this month to ratify its existing rules, omitting a shareholder motion to lower the threshold. The company said that its own proposal provided \"a more effective method to commence further engagement on the topic of special meetings, rather than a vote on the stockholder proposal\". By pushing more radical shareholder proposals off the ballot, companies are engaging in \"gamesmanship\", said Rosemary Lally of the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members have combined assets of more than $3.5tr. \"It's not a very democratic process when you do it that way.\" JPMorgan's management proposal received 58 per cent shareholder backing and Capital One's just over half \u2014 less support than is typical for management proposals but enough to pass.

Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. \"The internet is going to have a native currency so let's not wait for it to happen, let's help it happen,\" Dorsey said on stage at the Consensus blockchain conference in New York Wednesday. \"I don't know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\" The CEO, who also runs Twitter, said he's a \"huge fan\" of bitcoin and appreciates its underlying technology. Using it or another cryptocurrency as a global currency would lower the barrier for Dorsey's payments company to enter new markets, he said. \"If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we're in,\" Dorsey said. Since Square deals with fiat currency, Dorsey said the company has to approach each market differently, find a unique banking partner, and work with different regulators depending on the country. Square launched cryptocurrency trading through its Cash app in January. The payments processing company said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter. Square spent $33.9 million to buy bitcoin to allow people to trade it through its Cash mobile payments app. As a result, adjusted revenue from bitcoin was just $200,000. Square's mobile payment app is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo and is getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, according to Nomura Instinet. Dorsey has been notoriously bullish on bitcoin's role in the future of payments, and told the Sunday times newspaper in March he expects bitcoin to become the single global currency within the next decade. Dorsey is a personal investor in bitcoin and said he expects the digital currency to be used for simple things like coffee. The CEO predicted a 10-year timeline \"but it could go faster,\" the U.K.-based paper reported. Others, including Stanley Druckenmiller, have been skeptical about a practical use for bitcoin. He told CNBC in December that he doesn't hold bitcoin and it won't work as currency \"because you can't do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility.\" Bitcoin has fallen roughly 40 percent this year, and was trading near $8,260 Wednesday.

The U.S. retail giant said Wednesday that it would acquire an initial stake of roughly 77 percent in Flipkart. The remainder of the business will be held by existing investors, including Flipkart's co-founder Binny Bansal, Tencent, Tiger Global and Microsoft. Walmart said in a statement that its long-term aim would be to support Flipkart's transition into a publicly listed subsidiary. The retailer said it expects India's e-commerce market to grow at four times the rate of the overall retail industry. Walmart's president and chief executive, Doug McMillon, said the investment in Flipkart was part of the company's aim to invest in India's fast-growing economy. \"India is one of the most attractive retail markets in the world, given its size and growth rate, and our investment is an opportunity to partner with the company that is leading transformation of e-commerce in the market,\" McMillon said in a statement. show chapters Walmart announces 77% stake in India\u2019s Flipkart 7:38 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 05:06 Walmart's investment in Flipkart includes $2 billion of fresh equity funding. Walmart said it will use a combination of newly issued debt and cash to finance the round. The two companies are in talks with other potential investors to join the investment, which could reduce Walmart's stake. Both companies will keep their distinct brands and operating structures, Walmart said. A final close to the deal is expected to take place later this year. Were the transaction to end in the second quarter of the fiscal year, Walmart said it would expect a hit to full year 2019 earnings per share (EPS) of roughly 25 cents to 30 cents. The company reported an earnings miss in February, signaling the competitive pressures it faces from the likes of Amazon in online retail. Earlier on Wednesday, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said Walmart had reached an agreement to take control of Flipkart. SoftBank is currently one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart. According to some reports, the Japanese tech giant is set to sell its entire stake as part of the deal. show chapters Jim Cramer on Walmart\u2019s biggest deal ever 9:34 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 04:44 Flipkart has 100 million users signed up to its platform, according to the company's website. India, which has a population of 1.3 billion, is seeing rapid growth in its digital economy with the emergence of e-commerce start-ups like Snapdeal and Paytm. The investment will see Walmart take on U.S. e-commerce firm Amazon in a key growth market for the company. In 2016, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that his company would invest $3 billion in India. Amazon reportedly made its own bid for a majority stake in Flipkart. Walmart's deal with Flipkart follows a merger between its U.K. supermarket brand Asda and rival Sainsbury's, a tie-up that presented a significant competitive challenge to Britain's dominant grocer Tesco.

on \"Fast Money\" Thursday evening. Neu-Ner, who is host of CNBC Africa's \"Crypto Trader\" and the founder of OnChain Capital, has traveled extensively to places like Singapore and Japan, where he said ICOs, a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures, are thriving. \"I know [the SEC is] balancing investor protection with the need to grow an industry,\" said Neu-Ner, an early investor of cryptocurrency like bitcoin. But many entrepreneurs are establishing companies in places like Singapore and the European island nation of Malta, places that offer better tax incentives, Neu-Ner warned. The SEC has long been cautious of ICOs, which are a still unregulated way of raising money. About $600 million has been raised by way of fraudulent ICOs, according to the SEC. On Wednesday, the commission set up a website to teach investors what a fake ICO looks like. \"The SEC did adopt a responsible approach by taking their time to see what's happening with the industry,\" Neu-Ner said. \"But now we know crypto is real.

In this case, the VHS, or winner, could be a bitcoin alternative like XRP, ether or litecoin. \"The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there,\" said Hutchins, who is also part-owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team. \"Different tokens will be used for different applications.\" Ethan Miller | Getty Images Instead of digital gold, he sees bitcoin as a more utilitarian metal. \"I think it's more like copper, like an industrial metal that's used for a purpose to drive an outcome,\" Hutchins said. \"There will be a token that's used just like there's an industrial metal that's used for wiring.\" As of Wednesday, bitcoin still made up more than 36 percent of the global market share among cryptocurrencies, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.

Morgan. According to the bank's analysis, Amazon's U.S. gross merchandise volume (GMV) \u2014 a key industry metric measuring total dollar value of merchandise sold online \u2014 is set to match Walmart's net U.S. sales by 2020 or 2021. \"Amazon is the second-largest U.S. retailer and fastest growing at scale,\" analyst Christopher Horvers wrote Monday. \"We believe key drivers of Amazon's share gains include: the Prime ecosystem; endless aisle driven by third-party seller expansion; outsized growth in large, underpenetrated categories; and removing friction and moving closer to customers.\" Though Walmart remains king of sales with $495.8 billion in annual revenue and U.S. sales of $318.5 billion (a 3.5 percent increase year over year) for the fiscal year ended in January, Amazon is growing at a faster pace in the United States. Jeff Bezos' company boosted GMV from $141 billion in 2016 to $186 billion in 2017, a 31 percent increase year over year. show chapters This portfolio manager says Amazon's valuation is 'obscene' 12:37 AM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 02:09 In its first comments on the exact size of its membership program, Amazon recently revealed that it boasts more than 100 million as the e-commerce giant explores areas outside its traditional consumer goods environment. J.P. Morgan expects this number to hit roughly 140 million in 2019. The company recently announced that it would raise prices for its premium membership to $119 from $99, a move Wall Street applauded as beneficial to its revenue base. \"Prime delivers such massive scale and features that we believe it would be very difficult for any company to replicate,\" Horvers added. \"The company offers same-day free shipping on more than a million items for Prime members when ordered before noon in 8,000 cities and towns. Prime Now goes a step further and guarantees two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items in 32 U.S. cities.\" While the price increases are pushing Amazon's stock even higher, Horvers noted that the company is still accruing market share, predicting that it will jump to 50 percent of e-commerce sales from 41 percent of sales over the next few years. J.P. Morgan has an overweight rating on Amazon shares. Amazon's stock is up 37 percent so far this year, well ahead of the S&P 500's 2.1 percent gain over the same period; the stock is up 66 percent over the last 12 months.

Interest rates in the U.S. are at levels not seen in years and that could have massive ramifications across different financial markets, especially for gold, MKM Partners' Michael Darda warned on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rose to its highest level since 2011 this week, while the two-year note yield trades at a level not seen in a decade. Investors have been selling Treasurys amid fears that rising inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market is expecting. \"Rates on risk-free cash assets (government bills and notes) in the U.S. have now risen to a record high against equivalent rates on euro-area debt.

For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 are up only 0.3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Last year, both indexes surged at least 19 percent. Darda added gold could be in danger, as the higher rates could spark a bear market for the precious metal. \"Although the relationship isn't perfect, rising real rates ... have been strongly inversely related to the level of gold prices over the last two decades.\" Gold prices have been under pressure this year, falling more than 1 percent in that time period. The precious metal also posted its biggest one-day decline since November 2016 on Tuesday, dropping to a level not seen since Dec. 28.

Shares of NXP Semiconductors jumped about 12 percent Monday on a report that Chinese regulators will restart a review of Qualcomm's takeover bid for the company. Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that China's Ministry of Commerce has been asked to hasten the deal's review as well as Qualcomm's plans to protect local companies. Qualcomm's share price gained 2.5 percent on the report. Qualcomm is proposing to buy NXP for $127.50 a share, or $44 billion. The deal has received approval from eight of nine global regulators. Chinese regulators have said the deal could hurt competition within the chipmaker sector. The new report is another indication that U.S.-China trade relations appear to be thawing. On Sunday, President Donald Trump said he would help Chinese cellphone maker ZTE \"get back into business, fast.\" This comes after the U.S. imposed a ban on exports from U.S. companies to ZTE earlier this year. In a tweet, the president said: \"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\" Tweet A spokesperson for NXP told CNBC in an email that the company \"has a policy to not comment on rumors, speculation or ongoing regulatory matters.\" Qualcomm did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Instead, two of the luxury cars were from Broadway Supercars, a New Jersey-based car rental, and one belonged to company founder John Nouri. He said he was hired to park the cars for about five hours Monday morning on Sixth Ave just outside a Hilton hotel, where more than 8,500 people are expected to attend CoinDesk's Consensus conference that kicked off Monday. It's part of a promotion for the conference, and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, he said. \"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo.\" \"I never made money with crypto but I have ten lambos,\" Nouri said. His company rents Lamborghinis out for $1,000 a day. Bitcoin multiplied 13 times in price last year, minting cryptocurrency millionaires. A Lamborghini can cost about $200,000 or more, and the luxury cars have become an internet symbol for volatile cryptocurrencies' massive potential for wealth creation. \"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and \u2026 the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview. Case in point, coder Peter Saddington, 35, bought a Lamborghini three years ago for $200,000 with 45 bitcoins.

The report, citing people familiar with the matter, said employees in the wholesale division added or altered the information without customers' knowledge, including Social Security numbers, addresses and dates of birth. The bank became aware of the behavior in recent months from employees, the Journal reported.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield rose to its highest level since 2011 on Tuesday, while the short-term two-year yield traded near levels not seen in about a decade, raising concern about how portfolio managers will navigate this changing investment landscape. But most of them have never operated in a rising rates environment. Themedian tenure of an active equity manager is eight years, according to Fundstrat, citing figures gathered from Morningstar. The last time rates were in a significant uptrend was from 2003 to 2006 before the financial crisis struck. \"There are a lot of people that haven't been through many things in this youthful industry,\" said Timothy Parton, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan. \"The time when rates are rising coincides with a period in the cycle that is tough for any manager. You don't want to be too cautious, but you don't want to be too aggressive too early.\" The Fed slashed the overnight rate down to zero in 2008 during the aftermath of the financial crisis. The central bank's goal at the time was to stimulate the economy. Now that the economy is out of its financial-crisis trough, the Fed has started to gradually hike rates closer to historical levels and market rates have responded. show chapters Earnings and interest rates driving markets, Fidelity's Jurrien Timmer says 1:50 PM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 08:07 Since late 2015, the Fed has raised rates a total of six times \u2014 including once this year \u2014bringing the overnight rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Market participants are expecting the Fed to raise rates at least twice more in 2018 and many think they may even raise four times. \"We're concerned about rising interest rates,\" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. \"Last year, we got a lot of multiple expansion. We think that's unlikely in a rising rate environment.\" J.P. Morgan's Parton and Allianz's Price have seen their share of rising-rate cycles. Parton has worked in portfolio management since the late 1980s, while Price has 45 years of experience in the financial industry. How to invest in rising rates Parton has managed the JPMorgan Growth Advantage Fund (VHIAX) \u2014 a four-star rate fund \u2014 since 2002. Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned 13.5 percent, according to Morningstar. The fund is also ranked in the 2nd percentile of the \"Large Growth\" category and has $8.6 billion in assets. He said the key to successfully dealing with rising rates is investing in companies \"that will continue to deliver regardless of the economic cycles.\" He named Facebook as an example of such companies. \"Your Facebook engagement won't go down if you lose your job. If anything, it will go up.\" Parton's Advantage fund owns just over a million Facebook shares, making it one of its biggest holdings. Allianz's Price, meanwhile, has co-managed the AllianzGI Technology Fund Class C (RCGTX) fund since its inception in 2002. Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned 13.8 percent and ranks in the 22nd percentile among \"Technology\" funds, according to Morningstar. The fund also manages $1.6 billion in assets. \"What you have to do is look for companies with high earnings or low valuations,\" Price said about investing when rates are rising. He also said he likes semiconductor stocks right now, noting that \"many of the semis are priced like the cycle is ending. People think earnings are peaking for those companies, but we think they can continue to grow.\" Price's fund owns 1.2 million shares of Micron Technology, as well as 99,650 shares of Nvidia and 608,810 shares of Marvell Technology, Morningstar data show.

In a review of 1,450 digital coin offerings, the Journal said it found that 271 bore red flags such as plagiarized documents or fake executive information. Investors have already claimed losses of up to $273 million in these projects, the newspaper said, according to lawsuits and regulatory actions. The coin sales, or \"initial coin offerings,\" give investors the chance to buy into a new digital token while letting developers get easy access to funding. The process may be a little too easy for many projects that are unproven or outright scams. Coin offerings have raised roughly $9.8 billion in the two years through mid-March, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. The Journal found widespread plagiarism in 111 projects' online whitepapers, including word-for-word copies of marketing plans and technical features. The demand is so high that freelancers will write the papers for $100 or more, the report said. Lifting images and names to create the appearance of a reputable development team is also not uncommon. One Polish banker named Jenish Mirani found that his profile picture was used by online payment project Denaro to portray its co-founder \"Jeremy Boker,\" the Journal said. The paper said no one responded to its attempts to reach the company. Many initial coin offerings officially prohibit U.S. citizens and residents from participating, out of fear of regulatory crackdown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has frozen assets and charged founders with fraud in several cases of cryptocurrency scams. On Wednesday, the SEC also launched a website called \"HoweyCoins.com\" to show investors what a fraudulent coin offering might look like online. Read the full WSJ story here.

British regulators have fined Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley 642,430 pounds ($870,428) for breaching conduct rules by attempting to identify who sent letters criticizing an employee of the bank, they said on Friday. The fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority included a 30 percent discount for Staley agreeing at an early stage to settle. \"Mr Staley's actions fell short of the standard of due skill, care and diligence expected of a CEO in a regulated firm,\" the FCA said. show chapters Barclays CEO escapes with fine, keeps job 3:06 PM ET Fri, 20 April 2018 | 01:14 Regulators said the fine was only 10 percent of his overall pay package. While it draws a line under an episode some insiders had feared might cost him his job, Staley is the first sitting CEO of a major bank to face such a penalty. Barclays had no immediate comment, but is expected to follow up on Friday by imposing a further fine of its own on Staley. The regulatory findings will also be closely read by lawmakers keen to ensure top banking officials are held accountable for their actions at a time when there are growing calls to better protect whistleblowers. The regulators stopped short of saying Staley was unfit to continue in his role, after he twice attempted to find out who wrote letters raising \"concerns of a personal nature\" about an unidentified senior employee. \"Mr Staley acted unreasonably in proceeding in this way and, in doing so, risked undermining confidence in Barclays' whistleblowing policy and the protections it afforded to whistleblowers,\" the FCA said. Experts believe the fact the author of the letters was not a Barclays employee might have helped Staley's case, as there are strict rules designed to protect internal company whistleblowers. Barclays had said in April last year it had reprimanded Staley and would cut his bonus as the two financial watchdogs launched a year-long investigation into his actions. Authorities in the United States are still investigating the case.

Bitcoin cash, a bitcoin offshoot, split off from bitcoin last year after a small group of developers decided to add upgrades that would improve transaction efficiency. The original Bitcoin is being referred to as Bitcoin core to differentiate it from the other version. But Ver, who is sometimes called \"Bitcoin Jesus\" because he was one of the first investors of bitcoin, said the Bitcoin core software is \"slow, expensive and unreliable.\" Instead, he recommended bitcoin cash, which he said, is built specifically for transactions. Ver said new innovation and infrastructures are being built on top of bitcoin cash, \"because it actually works.\" \"All of these existing businesses are building their new products on top of bitcoin cash, just like myself as the CEO of bitcoin.com,\" Ver said on \"Fast Money\" Tuesday. His website helps investors buy and store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \"The economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that led to bitcoin's original success,\" Ver said. \"I'm incredibly bullish on bitcoin cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on bitcoin back in 2011.\" On Tuesday, bitcoin cash created a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits. The software update immediately caused bitcoin cash's value to fall by about 5 percent. Still, at just above $1,300 Tuesday evening 6 p.m. ET, bitcoin cash is almost double its April 17 level of $763, when BKCM investment firm founder and CEO Brian Kelly predicted the coin would make a comeback later in the year. Bitcoin cash was also the best performing large-cap cryptocurrency in the last month, beating out other large-cap digital coins like ethereum, ripple and traditional bitcoin. Ver wasn't worried about Tuesday's sudden decline and even predicted bitcoin cash would double by the end of the year. \"That's what actually gives [bitcoin cash] its underlying value, that you can use it in commerce to pay for things. Whereas, a lot of these other tokens out there just kind of turn into speculative assets that don't actually have any utility.\" \"It's happening fast and furious around the world,\" he said. \"Bitcoin cash works as money; bitcoin core, sadly, no longer does.\" WATCH: Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? show chapters Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? 9:27 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 05:22 Disclaimer ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/02/101237533-10264_Roger-Ver-2.jpg?v=1513089999", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Roger Ver"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin Jesus"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "6:10 PM ET Tue"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "15"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "09:42 Cryptocurrency"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Roger Ver"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ver"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Ver"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ver"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Fast Money"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ver"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2011"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "32"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "MB"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "about 5 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "just above $1,300"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "evening"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "6 p.m. ET"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "April 17"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "763"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BKCM"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Brian Kelly"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last month"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "about Tuesday's"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the end of the year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "9:27 AM ET Thu"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "26 Oct 2017"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Disclaimer"}], "description": "Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, aka \"Bitcoin Jesus,\" says bitcoin cash is faster and more reliable than the original bitcoin core.

In a stunning election victory last week, the Pakatan Harapan opposition alliance beat the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which had been in power for the past 60 years. \"The two keywords ... are 'if' and 'could. The rating agencies have said, yes, there's some credit negative aspects to the potential fiscal policy, but it's still some way off,\" Ashley Perrott, head of pan-Asia fixed income at UBS Asset Management, told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford. \"I think yes, if they follow through with everything they're talking about doing, the infrastructure concerns, the GST (goods and services tax) repeal, that could be credit negative, sure. But I think that's six months before we really get something concrete from the agencies,\" he added. The country's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had pledged during the campaign trail to scrap the unpopular GST and following his victory, added that infrastructure projects committed to by ousted leader Najib Razak will be re-looked. But Moody's Investor Service had cautioned in a note on Monday that replacing GST with a proposed sales and services tax \u2014 without corresponding measures to match revenue collection \u2014 could prove to be credit negative for Malaysia. \"There is little clarity on Pakatan Harapan's economic policy agenda, apart from a few specific campaign pledges that are credit negative at the outset, but lack details that would allow a full assessment of budgetary and macroeconomic effects,\" Anushka Shah, sovereign risk group senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, said in a note. But what Malaysia could lose in tax revenues would be diminished by the broad move higher in oil prices \u2014 good news for the oil exporter. \"If they were to repeal the GST in an environment where oil prices were actually declining \u2014 you go back 12 months, that was the story \u2014 that would be much more problematic,\" Perrott said, adding that oil prices at their current levels allowed for fiscal flexibility for the government. The yield on the 10-year Malaysian government bond last stood at 4.21 percent after earlier yielding 4.255 percent, its highest since January 2017. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

Getty Images The city, long an oasis of good government and transparent finance in a region that often struggles with corruption and illicit money dealings, is well aware of its reputation and wants to keep it. In a report released at the end of April, Hong Kong rates its ability to fight dirty money flows as \"medium-high,\" citing its strong legal system, political commitment to the issue, and cooperation between the public and private sectors. But the very strengths that give the city economic dynamism \u2014 such as openness to financial flows and the sheer size of the banking system \u2014 can also be weaknesses. \"We are alert to the fact that Hong Kong's competitive advantages \u2026 could also make it attractive for criminals seeking to hide or move funds.\" -Paul Chan, financial secretary, Hong Kong The government's Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report rated Hong Kong's overall money laundering risk, threat and vulnerability as \"medium-high,\" though it said the banking sector specifically faces a \"high\" risk. \"We are alert to the fact that Hong Kong's competitive advantages \u2026 could also make it attractive for criminals seeking to hide or move funds,\" Paul Chan, financial secretary of Hong Kong, said in the report. show chapters Current situation on anti-money laundering isn\u2019t satisfactory: ECB 9:40 AM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 03:13 Illustrating the importance of finance to Hong Kong, nearly 200 banking institutions had assets of HK$22.7 trillion ($2.89 trillion) at the end of 2017 \u2014 an amount almost equivalent to nine times the size of its economy, according to the assessment. Keith Williamson, managing director and head of disputes and investigations in Hong Kong and China for turnaround firm Alvarez & Marsal, said that authorities must balance the need for openness and accessibility with regulation that's tight enough to deter money launderers. \"It's a difficult balancing act to perform,\" Williamson, an expert in forensic and investigative accounting, told CNBC. So-called suspicious transaction reports have nearly tripled in the five years to 2017, partly due to stepped-up monitoring and better compliance since the 2012 implementation of a local ordinance against money laundering and terrorist financing. Money launderers change their game The report described coping with the increase as a \"challenge.\" Analysts agree the system is under strain. Angus Young, a specialist in regulation, governance and compliance who teaches at Hong Kong Baptist University, gives authorities high marks for implementing anti-money laundering legislation and for awareness of the problem. \"So it's basically like an air bubble under the carpet. Once you press down on one side of the carpet the air bubble moves to the other.\" -Angus Young, senior lecturer, Hong Kong Baptist University But Hong Kong suffers from a lack of qualified specialists, especially at non-banks such as local securities firms as well as at regulators, who are capable of analyzing complex transactions amid the toughened compliance and risk requirements, Young said. That combined with general weaknesses in compliance and training leaves Hong Kong in a \"vulnerable\" state overall, he said. \"What I feel is that it underrepresents the true possibility of financial crimes, especially in anti-money laundering,\" he said of the government's assessment. Young also said that while efforts to profile money launderers can be successful, so is their ability to adapt to changed circumstances. show chapters Is China threatening Asia's financial center? 5:17 AM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 | 03:28 \"So it's basically like an air bubble under the carpet,\" he said. \"Once you press down on one side of the carpet the air bubble moves to the other.\" The situation surrounding terrorist financing is less of a concern, according to the report, which described Hong Kong as having a \"medium-low\" risk level. The report was issued ahead of a visit by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, the global standard bearer for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing, planned for later this year. The United States has in recent years pushed for a stronger global regime against money laundering and terror financing and has used sanctions and penalties to spread the message, Williamson said, which has caused governments to beef up their financial defenses. \"So I don't think it's just a local reaction to the challenges that there are here,\" he said of Hong Kong's stance. \"It's clearly in line as well with an increased regulatory regime around this globally.'

This is positive for the U.S. economy, Colas said, as U.S. workers are usually reluctant to take time off from work. \"There's no way around it: Americans have a complicated relationship with the concept of vacation,\" said Colas in a note this week. \"According to an annual survey done by the US Travel Association, more than half of US workers do not use all their paid-for vacation days.\" Two of the most common reasons Americans cite for not using all of their vacation days every year are the fear \"looking replaceable\" and the cost of travel, Colas said citing figures from the U.S. Travel Association. \"To say you don't take vacation for fear of being fired speaks to job security,\" he noted. \"Cost of travel relates to income and consumer confidence.\" The U.S. jobs market is currently in a healthy state.

Grogan | CNBC Ray Dalio Successful hedge fund managers should do something unusual if they want to stay that way: Say no to new investors. The bigger a hedge fund gets, the worst it tends to perform, according to a new academic study. Holding other features constant, a 10 percent increase in fund size results\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad in a decrease of 13 basis points per month (or 1.53 percent per year) in raw returns on average and a decrease of 10 basis points per month (or 1.21 percent per year) in style-adjusted returns, according to the paper from Purdue University. \"A key implication of our findings for investors is that performance persistence is achievable when funds maintain a small size,\" researchers Chao Gao, Tim Haight and Chengdong Yin wrote. \"Fund performance declines with fund age and that declining performance is not significantly related to a variety of fund and family-level characteristics, nor is it significantly related to young funds assuming higher downside risk.\" The paper clarifies prior literature that found that hedge fund performance peaks during the first few years of a fund's life, but declines thereafter at an average rate of 42 basis points per year. The decline in performance, according to the Purdue researchers, appears to be due to managers taking their eye of the ball and focusing more on asset gathering (and the steady fees that come with them) rather than investing. Other studies hold that historical compensation contracts in the hedge fund industry, such as 2 percent management and 20 percent performance fees, is not effective at aligning managers' incentives with investors' interests. Yin's 2016 study, for example, demonstrates that the management fee comprises a larger portion of total compensation when funds grow large and thus a fund's optimal size, from a compensation perspective, exceeds the size that is optimal for performance. The research comes amid an ongoing move by funds to offer more competitive fee structures amid lackluster performance, declining revenues and rapidly evaporating investor patience. \"When funds grow large, fund managers may have less incentive to improve fund performance because most of their compensation comes from the asset-based management fee,\" the researchers concluded. \"Thus, investing in small funds, regardless of age, may provide for superior and sustainable returns.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/09/13/103936243-20160913-8171-2234.jpg?v=1530207621", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "David A.

The firm bought Stockholm, Sweden-based payments start-up iZettle for $2.2 billion. That's double the valuation it was reported to be looking to fetch with a listing on the Nasdaq in Stockholm later this year. What is iZettle? IZettle is a rival to Square, the U.S. fintech firm led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, but only competes directly with the $21 billion company in the U.K. The company makes small, wireless chip readers along with a number of other payment processing products. It recently launched a new product that lets small businesses build their own online stores. The acquisition means that iZettle will no longer be seeking a listing of its own, something it \"spent roughly a year\" trying to achieve, according to Jacob de Geer, the firm's chief executive. \"I think it's important to clarify that since we started the company in 2010 we've been doing a lot of work with PayPal and the team at various capacities in terms of cooperation and partnerships,\" De Geer said in a phone interview with CNBC on Friday. Johan Jeppsson | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"We've been struggling all along to get to the vision we're aiming for in terms of helping small businesses and competing with the giants, and PayPal has in the area of 20 million merchants whereas iZettle has 500,000,\" he added. The company has so far failed to make a profit, but has said it wants to achieve positive consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2020. De Geer said at the time of iZettle's IPO announcement that it would look to draw in some slightly larger merchants. Why did PayPal buy iZettle? For PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready, the move is about increasing its payments presence among physical retailers. \"This phenomenon of in-store payments via mobile for small businesses, it's a global phenomenon and there have been many players in the space,\" Ready told CNBC. \"Most of them though have been constrained to one or only a few countries.\" IZettle is currently present in 12 countries in Europe and Latin America, while PayPal operates in more than 200. Ready said that, following the deal, PayPal would look to expand iZettle's international presence further. \"What I think is quite distinctive about this team is their ability to go serve small businesses on a multinational basis,\" he said. Eric Piermont | AFP | Getty Images PayPal, a company worth almost $94 billion, is used by major retailers around the world, including Walmart and Best Buy. IZettle's focus, on the other hand, is more on small-to-medium-sized firms. E-commerce giant eBay dealt PayPal a blow earlier this year when it decided it would drop PayPal as its primary payments provider. The online shopping site chose a European start-up of its own, Adyen, to replace PayPal. Adyen is also reportedly seeking to list its shares. PayPal's Ready said that the investment in iZettle would give PayPal more of a \"technical\" presence in Europe. \"Europe contains many of our most important markets, we have huge presence in Europe already from a commercial perspective,\" he said. \"But one of the things that we think is fantastic is that his is going to create a European center of excellence for us on a technical perspective.\" He added: \"We'll now have an amazing team of engineers and product development and builders here in Stockholm to increase our presence in Europe from a technical perspective and help us build out many more capabilities.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/12/104894189-GettyImages-485522548_1.jpg?v=1513100173", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "nearly $2.2 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "9:50 AM ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "18"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Stockholm"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Sweden"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "iZettle"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$2.2 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Nasdaq"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Stockholm"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "later this year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "iZettle"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Square"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Twitter"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jack Dorsey"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$21 billion"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.K."}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "roughly a year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jacob de Geer"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2010"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "De Geer"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Johan Jeppsson"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bloomberg"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "20 million"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "iZettle"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2020"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "De Geer"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "iZettle's"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bill Ready"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "12"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Latin America"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "more than 200"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "iZettle"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Eric Piermont"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "AFP"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images PayPal"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "almost $94 billion"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Walmart"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Best Buy"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "eBay"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "earlier this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "European"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Adyen"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Adyen"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ready"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "iZettle"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "European"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Stockholm"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Europe"}], "description": "PayPal's acquisition means iZettle will no longer be seeking a listing of its own, something it \"spent roughly a year\" trying to achieve.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/why-paypal-bought-izettle-for-2-point-2-billion.html", "author": "Johan Jeppsson | Bloomberg via Getty Images", "title": "Why PayPal bought a European start-up with IPO plans for $2.2 billion"}, {"time": "2018-05-20T17:16:31-0400", "body": " show chapters $2.5B fund manager sees 'inconvenient truths' in market, says inflation causing major stock shift 4:57 PM ET Thu, 17 May 2018 | 02:32 Whether Wall Street is ready or not, veteran fund manager Larry Glazer warns a major shift is coming to the stock market.

Recent evidence suggests gas prices are on the rise ahead of Memorial Day. \"It will begin to affect consumers as the summer driving season kicks in,\" he added. 'Put that money to work' Due to the emerging scenario, Glazer is advising investors to limit mega cap stocks and big tech exposure \u2014 groups that had been rallying as inflation and interest rates were at historic lows. \"It's about re-positioning portfolios \u2014 recognizing the new paradigm,\" he said, advocating a more domestic approach to investing right now. He prefers small cap value, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), financials and energy. According to Glazer, they'll be the biggest beneficiaries of rising rates and an inflation comeback. If this environment feels feels too unsettled, he points out there's always cash. \"A 2 percent money market sounds really great. It's actually outperforming a lot of areas of the stock market,\" Glazer said. \"As you get a bout of volatility later in the year, you can re-position.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's top deputies are edging toward a clash that could shape the pace of interest-rate hikes in coming months, as well as how the Fed should prepare for and combat the next economic downturn. The fault lines are technical as well as philosophical and include a debate over whether the economy has shifted into a higher gear, giving the Fed room for more interest-rate hikes and perhaps reducing the need for controversial tools like bond-buying to fight future recessions. They come as tax cuts and government spending boost growth and inflation, giving policymakers the breathing room to debate whether to retool the Fed's basic policy approach to give themselves more firepower even if slower future economic growth is unavoidable. San Francisco Fed President John Williams launched a critical salvo in the debate on Tuesday with a speech underscoring his view that the Fed has only a few more rate hikes ahead of it before rates reach a level of borrowing costs that allows the economy to coast along, without stimulating or slowing its progress. This neutral rate, which can only be estimated and not observed, serves as a sort of speed limit on interest-rate hikes and is at the heart of the current policy debate. Stephen Lam | Reuters John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"It's important to distinguish between the current strong economic conditions and the key longer-run drivers underpinning interest rates,\" he said at the Economic Club of Minnesota. Despite economic tailwinds like tax cuts and government spending, \"the longer-run drivers still point to a 'new normal' of a low (neutral rate) and relatively low interest rates.\" Williams, whose research has helped convince most of his colleagues that the neutral rate of interest is much lower than in the past, stands to become even more influential when he takes over as chief of the New York Fed next month, a position that will make him a permanent voter on the Fed's policy-setting committee. His view contrasts with recent optimism from some economists and central bankers. Among them is the Fed vice chair for financial supervision, Randal Quarles, a Trump administration appointee who in February said he believed there is a \"real possibility\" that the economy could shift to a higher growth trajectory. Quarles' view suggests that the Fed has a bit more room to raise rates without braking the economy, which would, in turn, give it the flexibility to cut rates more deeply in the next downturn, and perhaps avoiding the need for unconventional measures like bond purchases. Fed Board nominee Richard Clarida, at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, flagged some discomfort with such measures, which began in the depths of the financial crisis to stabilize banks and were later were expanded to help bring down high unemployment and lift excessively low inflation. Though the Fed's initial program of so-called quantitative easing \"made sense,\" Clarida said he was not sure how he would have voted on subsequent rounds, and said in response to a question from Republican Senator Pat Toomey that he was \"very sympathetic to your view that any discussion and thinking about QE would have to take a serious look at costs as well as benefits.\" Williams for his part on Tuesday called bond-buying an important part of the policy-easing tools that the Fed \"is going to have to turn to\" to fight future downturns. Rate cuts alone, from what will be a relatively low starting point and only able to fall as far as zero, would not provide enough firepower to stimulate the economy, he has said in the past. Williams has also said that \"time is pressing\" for a rethink of the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. A new policy framework, he has said, conceivably could give the central bank more room for maneuver even with a low neutral rate by allowing it to defer rate hikes after a recession even if inflation pushes up to, or even past, its long-run target. Several other Fed policymakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, have lent support to a debate on the framework. Quarles by contrast has suggested that there is little need to rethink the framework if inflation rises back to the Fed's 2 percent target, as it has lately done. Clarida did not weigh in on that debate on Tuesday, or on his view of the neutral rate. But if he and fellow nominee Michelle Bowman are confirmed it is a topic that will heat up in coming months.

Ran Neu-Ner, founder of Onchain Capital and host of CNBC Africa's \"Crypto Trader,\" offered a few tips to \"Fast Money\" traders on Thursday. Here are some of his favorite and least favorite digital currencies. Bitcoin Neu-Ner is an early investor of the large-cap coin. But he still said to sell. Chesnot | Getty Images \"I like bitcoin,\" he said, but pointed out that it's, \"priced too low.\" The coin, valued as high as $19,500 late last year, was trading around $8,100 on Thursday evening. \"It's going to continue to go up, slowly and in a stable way,\" he said. \"But there are more exciting cryptocurrencies out there.\" Bitcoin cash One of them might be bitcoin cash. The coin, priced around $1,200 Thursday evening, was down by about $100 from Tuesday. But that's still almost double its April 17 level of $763. With a solid team behind the coin, Neu-Ner said he sees a lot of potential. Ethereum Hold this coin, Neu-Ner said, \"for sure.\" He pointed out that ethereum has many potential uses and one of the biggest communities in the industry, with thousands of people, \"the smartest people in the room.\" Getty Images But it's not just ethereum Neu-Ner is excited about. \"I'm excited for a new generation of protocols like ethereum,\" he said. Some picks: Oasis, Zilliqa and Thunder Token. \"Ethereum has scalability issues,\" Neu-Ner said. \"They're doing 15 transactions per second. That means, that's not real-world stuff.

The company is aiming to give AWS customers an \"easy button\" to get into the same technology that underpins bitcoin. \"They can focus on their scenario and they don't have to become PhDs is cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain,\" said Steve Cerveny, one of the founders of Kaleido. show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 Blockchain technology records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases.

It is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS Marketplace and will help them rapidly advance their blockchain projects.\" Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers a paid subscription for cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. AWS is using a partner-led strategy instead of building from the ground up. \"They've been looking for partners to help get blockchain into their customers' hands,\" Cerveny told CNBC. \"They're putting it in the marketplace will accelerate what their customers are going to do with it.\" The founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is what Kaleido and AWS will be using, said this is the biggest move yet by the tech giant to get into blockchain. \"This is a heavy duty, full stack way of getting the company into blockchain solutions,\" said Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum. Blockchain can help Amazon in other arms of the ever-expanding business he said, using supply chain as one example. Lubin said Consensys, which oversees more than 50 blockchain projects, has seen a major increase in interest around the technology. \"Three years ago we were getting calls from companies trying to spell blockchain and trying to order one in a color because their boss told them they should get a blockchain,\" Lubin said. \"At this point there are tens of thousands of companies around the world that have real sophistication around this.\" Amazon joins other tech giants including Microsoft and Facebook exploring use cases for blockchain. Facebook announced last week it is going through a reorganization that will include a new blockchain effort and aims to address privacy concerns.

Berkshire more than doubled its stake in Teva, to 40 million shares, in the first three months of this year after first reporting a stake of 18.8 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. The changes are reflected in Berkshire's latest regulatory filing on Tuesday, but they only report holdings up to the end of March. Shares of Teva rose 3.3 percent in premarket trading Wednesday. show chapters Buffett adds Teva in 13F filing 7:46 PM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 00:55 Berkshire also reported adding 7.3 million shares of Monsanto in the first quarter, to total 19 million shares.

U.S. inflation is rising toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal while not accelerating enough to suggest the economy is overheating, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Tuesday. Inflation is approaching 2 percent but it's \"not running away from us,\" he said at an event titled \"Energy, Trade, and Energy Growth\" sponsored by the Council for Foreign Relations. Inflation data for April indicated further growth on domestic wages and consumer prices although they fell short of market expectations. Kaplan, who is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2018, said he expected the U.S. economy to grow about 2.50 percent to 2.75 percent in 2018, underpinned by the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years enacted last December. He cautioned the tax boost would fade in 2019, slowing gross domestic product to 1.75 percent to 2 percent growth rate by 2020. With businesses expanding and the consumer sector in \"pretty good shape,\" Kaplan said the Federal Reserve will likely stay on track to raise key overnight borrowing costs at a gradual pace. He told reporters after the event that he was not committed to whether the Fed would raise short-term interest rates two or three more times in 2018. Interest rates futures implied a more than a 50 percent chance the U.S. central bank would increase rates by year-end to bring its target range to 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The FOMC, which is scheduled to next meet on June 12-13, last raised its federal funds rate to 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent in March. Kaplan prefers US yield curve not invert Separately, Kaplan said he is keeping an eye on the shape of the U.S. yield curve and would be wary if it were to invert, a market move that has often preceded recent U.S. recessions. Kaplan, who spoke to reporters after an event sponsored by the Council for Foreign Relations, said he would not like to see the U.S. yield \"inadvertently\" invert, a move in which short-term U.S. bond yields rise above long-term ones.

CBS and Viacom have not been able to come to terms on some aspects of their merger and CBS is fighting what it calls interference by the Redstone family. \"They can get a lot more value from other players than this kind of forced marriage that's being contemplated here,\" said Crockett, senior analyst at B. Riley FBR. Shares of CBS plunged Thursday after a judge said National Amusements, controlled by the Redstone family, can challenge CBS' voting control plan. Getty Images; Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images CBS wants to cut National Amusement's voting power through a special dividend to shareholders. Its board scheduled a meeting to consider the dividend for later Thursday and confirmed that meeting would take place as planned despite the ruling. Crockett believes CBS is doing everything it can to protect the interests of its shareholders that don't have a majority of the vote. As for who may be a better match for CBS, Crockett told \"Power Lunch\" one potential partner could be Verizon. According to Reuters, Verizon had shown an interest in CBS. He said if the AT&T-Time Warner deal goes through, Verizon may want to think about that again. There is also a lot of interest among internet companies to get deeper into content, he added. \"If AT&T and Time Warner beat off the DOJ's antitrust suit there's going to be a lot more, I think, reasons to think about marriages of internet platforms with content and being able to use that combination to innovate in advertising and get scale with consumer data,\" said Crockett. Meanwhile, he thinks CBS shares will eventually recover no matter how the merger issue is resolved. \"It's a good company in a troubled sector,\" he said. \"At some point in the future we're going to have less uncertainty than we have today.\" He has a buy rating and $60 price target on the stock. \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.

Both countries have unveiled tariffs targeting one another. While those tensions show signs of thawing, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday the gap between the U.S. and China \"remains wide.\" The tariffs and retaliation from countries such as China put at risk large-cap companies that do a lot of business overseas. Small-cap companies, meanwhile, are less exposed to a trade war, given most of their business is domestic.

Those three stocks returned at least 12.1 percent on average during three-month periods when rates were surging, according to data from Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool. Apple and J.P. Morgan Chase are also big winners when rates jump, averaging returns of 11.8 percent and 10.9 percent in three months, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, averages returns of 4.8 percent. (The CNBC Kensho search used the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF as a proxy for the bond market. The search looked at periods of time when this ETF fell more than 5 percent in three months. Since bond prices move inversely to bond yields, this would correlate with an environment of rising rates.) Meanwhile, General Electric and Walmart are among the Dow stocks that are the biggest laggards when rates jump. GE averages a loss of 1 percent during three-month periods of rising rates, Kensho data show, while Walmart averages a slight return of 0.3 percent.

This Thursday, the Verkhovna Rada (the parliament of Ukraine) is expected to consider a historic proposal to replace 25-year-old foreign exchange legislation with an entirely new law that will open our country to international investors and make it easier for Ukrainian businesses to operate globally. Technical though it may seem, liberalization of our arcane foreign exchange controls will make Ukraine a much more investor-friendly place and will help the country take its rightful spot amongst the major European and global economies. For nearly four years now, we at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) have been working to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and create a solid foundation for economic growth in Ukraine and prosperity for all who live and work here. We have come a long way during that time. My new post-revolutionary team took over the National Bank in 2014, finding ourselves in an incredibly difficult context. Ukraine was not only experiencing military aggression from Russia in the East, but the profound economic turmoil that coincided with it \u2014 since, our team at the National Bank have worked tirelessly to stabilize the situation and tame inflation. Today, the banking system is in better shape than it ever has been in the history of independent Ukraine thanks to the clean-up and reforms implemented since 2014. All of the obligations that the National Bank took on under the last IMF (International Monetary Fund) memorandum have been fulfilled. External markets are also favorable for Ukraine as economies of our trade partners are recovering and commodity prices are high. We must maintain this momentum, make life better for businesses and support investment. The time has come for large-scale foreign exchange liberalization. The proposed law moves us toward that goal. To say it is overdue would be an understatement. The key legislation setting out our current currency control rules is a full 25 years old and it has not aged well. In the 1990s when Ukraine was struggling to tackle the Soviet legacy, set its economy on market rails and control capital outflows, highly restrictive rules on foreign currency transactions made sense. Today they are out of place and are holding back growth. Out of Ukraine's patchwork of foreign exchange laws, about 70 percent of the rules are about prohibiting or restricting things. This means administrative burden, delays and complications for Ukrainian businesses trading with overseas partners, foreign investors repatriating their investment or dividends, for Ukrainian freelancers doing work for overseas clients and many others. The regulatory system we have had in place for the last quarter of a century no longer reflects the business environment in Ukraine. Our highly qualified, multilingual workforce and our innovative approach to development has seen an ever-increasing amount of interest from foreign investors looking to set up in or outsource operations to Europe. Our tech sector is but one example: a thriving industry worth around $5 billion. We boast the largest number of IT professionals in Europe and play host to numerous multinational brands including Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Boeing, eBay, Siemens, IBM and Huawei, who all have research and development centers here. show chapters Trump: Companies see a 'tremendous potential' in the Ukraine 10:42 AM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 | 05:41 Our start-up environment too, is leading the way for our European peers. A number of high profile software start-ups, including the now-famous writing app Grammarly, have gone global and are used by millions every day. It is a lucrative sector: One of the most notable start-up deals we've seen came from Ukrainian-born augmented photography start-up Looksery, who was acquired by Snapchat for $150 million. When the draft law developed by my team, entitled \"Currency Law,\" is approved by parliament we can expect more and more success stories to come forward. The law will move Ukraine's foreign exchange regulation from a position of \"if it's not expressly allowed, it's forbidden\" to \"if it's not expressly forbidden, it's allowed\" \u2014 a much more helpful stance for our banks and businesses looking to operate internationally. Households back home will benefit too as more jobs are created. This reform will be some of the best news for business to come out of Ukraine this year. It will help give investors into Ukraine peace of mind and minimal administrative burden when it comes to doing deals or repatriating profits. As the ease of doing business continues to increase, so too will our country's ability to secure the investment we need. Looking at the big picture, this is Ukraine opening up to the world and taking a step forward on the (long) road of its EU integration ambitions. European Commission experts were involved in developing the new law and it takes inspiration from relevant EU Council regulations. This law is about the free movement of capital, which is crucial for well-functioning economies in today's world. That goal is always in sight for us. To achieve greater integration into the European economy, and our place globally, we must operate at the same level as our European counterparts. This means transparent operations and investor-friendly policy required to work together with international businesses. In addition, it means financial stability, as the \"Currency Law\" provides the National Bank with power and tools to prevent and get over the crises whatever origin and development they have. That is another reason why the draft law received the support of the International Monetary Fund. We, the National Bank of Ukraine and myself as its new governor, have a unique opportunity to help secure sustainable growth and prosperity for generations of Ukrainians \u2014 Ukraine has much to offer the world, and it is the NBU's job to make sure that everyone can benefit. \u2014Yakiv Smolii is the governor of the National Bank of Ukraine.

Real estate, the stock market and bitcoin are for amateurs. If you're looking to make some serious money, the kind that requires you to hire bodyguards and buy your own Brinks truck, you need an NFL franchise. The Carolina Panthers are getting a new owner, and David Tepper is set to pay a record $2.2 billion for the privilege. A jaw-dropping number, to be sure, given that Jerry Richardson paid $206 million for the rights to the expansion team in 1993. What makes the Panthers' sale price truly staggering, however, is that it's nearly a billion more than what Terry and Kim Pegula paid for the Buffalo Bills less than four years ago. More from USA Today: David Tepper expected to buy Panthers for $2.2 billion Five things to know about Panthers' likely buyer 2018 NBA draft lottery: Suns, Kings, Hawks land top three picks Granted, the Bills are the least-valuable of the 32 NFL teams, according to Forbes' 2017 valuations. But that alone can't explain the exorbitant jump in price. These are the Panthers that Tepper is buying, not the Patriots. For months now, the critics and naysayers have been sounding the alarm on the NFL. TV ratings are cratering! Fans have turned their backs on the league because of player protests during the national anthem! But what Tepper's purchase shows is that the NFL remains America's undisputed king. Owning a franchise is as close to a guaranteed moneymaker as there is. \"NFL franchises are enormously valuable,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College. \"If you gave me a choice, would I rather own a mid-table Major League Baseball team, a mid-table NBA team, a mid-table NHL team or a mid-table NFL team, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd take the NFL team.\" It's not hard to see why. While it's true the league's ratings have softened \u2013 as have those of pretty much everything on TV thanks to cord cutting \u2013 the NFL remains, by far, the most popular show going. NFL games accounted for the five most-watched TV shows last year and six of the top 10, according to Nielsen. The Super Bowl drew more than 111 million viewers, more than the four-highest non-NFL shows combined. The opening round of last month's draft on ESPN, Fox and NFL Network drew 11.2 million viewers. That's right. The draft. More than 11 million people tuned in for a show that featured about 60 seconds of \"action\" every 10 minutes or so. Those kind of numbers mean broadcasters and digital companies are still tripping over themselves for a piece of the NFL's action. Fox agreed earlier this year to pay the NFL $3.3 billion over five years just for the rights to Thursday Night Football. In December, Verizon agreed to pay $2 billion for five years' worth of streaming rights. Zimbalist did say he thinks the NFL's growth has flattened, and that the league faces challenges in the future because of concerns over head trauma. Right now, though, the biggest challenge appears to be what to do with all the cash the owners are getting. Baseball and the NBA have had some blockbuster sales. The Los Angeles Clippers sold for $2 billion four years ago and the Houston Rockets went for $2.2 billion last fall. The Los Angeles Dodgers commanded $2 billion in 2012 \u2013 but that included the team, Dodger Stadium and, perhaps most importantly, land around it. But those were exceptions, not the norm. Not so the NFL. The Panthers make three consecutive NFL teams to be sold for $1 billion or more, and none of them \u2013 Panthers, Bills or Cleveland Browns \u2013 would be considered one of the league's marquee franchises. If the Browns can command $1 billion, imagine what the Dallas Cowboys would go for on the open market. Or one of the New York teams. And we haven't even factored legalized sports betting into the equation yet. Imagine what Tepper would have had to pay had Richardson waited a week or two to finalize the deal. $2.5 billion? $3 billion? No doubt we'll soon find out. The Tennessee Titans, Denver Broncos and New Orleans Saints are considered the teams most likely to be on the block next, and the initial asking price just got higher. The NFL has its flaws, no question. Making its wealthy owners even wealthier is not one of them.

Tepper, who runs Appaloosa Management, would have to sell his stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to NFL rules.

Broadbent, 53, had told the newspaper that years of poor productivity and weak wage growth meant Britain was going through a \"menopausal\" moment. The Telegraph did not publish the quote in full. The ex-Goldman Sachs economist, among those tipped as a successor to BoE Governor Mark Carney who stands down next year, said in the interview that experts used the phrase to describe economies that were \"past their peak and no longer so potent\". His comments attracted derision on social media. \"As reported I found them pretty offensive,\" economist Kate Barker, one of Broadbent's predecessors on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, said on Twitter. Sarah Wollaston, a lawmaker of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, described Broadbent's comments as \"pejorative tosh\". \"#Menopause only a problem if others try to sideline you because of ignorant prejudice,\" she tweeted. Broadbent's comments are likely to put the relative lack of gender diversity in senior management back in the spotlight. Last year lawmakers said they were disappointed by finance minister Philip Hammond's slow progress at encouraging greater diversity at the highest levels of the Bank. There are only three women out of more than 20 officials who serve on the BoE's three major policy committees, appointed by the finance ministry. In his apology, Broadbent said he had been trying to explain the word \"climacteric\", a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the nineteenth century. \"Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders,\" he said.

The phone is part of Michel's digital platform Blacture, which was announced in a 2018 Super Bowl ad, and celebrates black culture through content and technology. The first retail move for Blacture is the launch of Motif, a $300 smartphone that hits stores this fall. \"When you use the phone you'll get paid and you can convert it into cash,\" Michel told CNBC'S \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"Blockchain is the technology.\" Michel said Motif users will earn a percentage on every purchase when they pay using their phone, which unlike airline miles can be redeemed for cash. The phone can also be linked to a Blacture debit card. Motif partnered with tech company Zippie, and Michel said the group is in talks with the top four U.S. phone carriers. Michel founded the Fugees with Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill, and the group went on to win two Grammys for \"Killing Me Softly\" in 1996. The rapper wouldn't say whether or not he owns any cryptocurrency. But Michel knew about it well before bitcoin's meteoric rise to $20,000 last year. \"A friend of mine introduced bitcoin to me when it was at 11 cents,\" he said. \"I didn't believe in it then.\" Bitcoin was the first use-case for blockchain but advocates say the technology has the power to disrupt industries from health care to the music business. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded on what's known as a \"distributed ledger,\" which can be accessed but not altered by the public. Michel's phone is not the only one using blockchain technology. Foxconn is making one for Sirin Labs called the \"Finney,\" which reportedly ships in October.

More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far. The coordinated effort, first reported by The Washington Post, focuses on a cryptocurrency fundraising process known as initial coin offerings, as well as other \"investment schemes.\" \"Although the international task force's work is far from complete, my suspicions have already been confirmed: The market for cryptocurrency investments is saturated with fraud, and our work is only revealing the tip of the iceberg,\" said Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. show chapters Securities regulator warns investors not to get fooled by bitcoin scams 8:10 PM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 | 00:37 Earlier in May, Texas regulators sent a warning letter to U.K.- based BTCrush saying it was violating securities laws and misleading investors through its marketing. The company published videos showing the interior and workings of what it said was three fully operating mining farms. State regulators said the videos were actually sourced from publicly available stock footage. The Texas regulator also took action against Wind Wide Coin, which used pictures of celebrities including Jennifer Aniston and Prince Charles to advertise its cryptocurrency. \"Promoters also know that anyone can be anyone and say anything about anything on the internet,\" Rotunda said. \"Not surprisingly, they are also manipulating photographs, media, testimonials and other online information to deceive the public into believing their claims.\" The crackdown comes amid growing attention in the U.S. to cryptocurrency scams, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC has brought several fraud cases against operators of initial coin offerings and last week launched a website to help investors recognize scams. Massachusetts regulators are also participating in the crackdown. William Francis Galvin, the state's secretary of the commonwealth, said NASAA's task force found roughly 30,000 crypto-related domain name registrations, many of which appeared in late 2017 as the price of bitcoin neared $20,000. \"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" Galvin said in a statement. \"Fraudulent activity involving ICOs and cryptocurrency-related investment products is a serious threat to Massachusetts investors.\" WATCH: This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID show chapters This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID 8:46 AM ET Sun, 13 May 2018 | 03:18 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/21/104912513-_sites_default_files_images_104912513-GettyImages-892695676.jpg?v=1516925827", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jaap Arriens"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "NurPhoto"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Getty Images Regulators"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Canada"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "More than 40"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Operation Crypto-Sweep"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "at least 70"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Washington Post"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Joseph Rotunda"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Texas State Securities Board"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:10 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "21"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Dec 2017"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Texas"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BTCrush"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Texas"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Wind Wide Coin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jennifer Aniston"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Rotunda"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Securities and Exchange Commission"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Massachusetts"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "William Francis Galvin"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "NASAA"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "roughly 30,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "late 2017"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Galvin"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Massachusetts"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "13"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "03:18"}], "description": "Regulators in the U.S. and Canada are launching a widespread crackdown on some cryptocurrency investment schemes in what's called \"Operation Cryptosweep.\" ", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/state-regulators-crack-down-on-cryptocurrency-investment-schemes.html", "author": "Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images", "title": "State regulators launch 'Operation Crypto-Sweep' to police cryptocurrency investment schemes"}, {"time": "2018-05-16T13:35:20-0400", "body": " Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images Daniel Pinto, head of the corporate and investment bank at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Daniel Pinto has seen his share of booms and busts. An Argentinean who spent much of his early career in volatile emerging markets, Pinto, 55, began at J.P. Morgan Chase in 1983 as a currency trader in Buenos Aires. Thanks to his ability to manage risk in a series of roles, Pinto has climbed the ranks. In 2014, he was named head of the firm's corporate and investment bank, the world's biggest by revenue. In January, he was named co-president of J.P. Morgan. That means he and partner Gordon Smith, who leads the consumer bank, are in line to succeed long-time CEO Jamie Dimon if the need arises within the next few years. show chapters J.P. Morgan names co-COOs and co-presidents Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith 5:20 PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 | 03:42 In an exclusive interview at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters and in a follow-up phone conversation, Pinto explains his views on a global economy in the latter stages of expansion, the opportunities he sees and how his bank is preparing for the inevitable downturn. CNBC: You spend a lot of time flying around the world visiting clients, leaders in industries from tech to energy. What are they telling you about the state of the economy? Pinto: Pretty much everyone agrees that the economy is in very good shape. Obviously, there are different dynamics in each of the sectors. For example, this week I was in Houston talking with some of the oil companies. They are quite positive about the economy, about oil prices maintaining a range, and they are quite positive about investments going into the sector. We have all these companies reporting earnings, and overall the results seem fine. The technical aspects of the markets are more balanced than they were late last year, where it was pretty much one view, and that view was that the markets will improve no matter what. So you have a bunch of components, from the technical part, to the economy performing and companies performing, which altogether makes me quite positive on the economy. CNBC: Where are you seeing opportunities now? You recently applied to Chinese regulators for a majority stake in a joint venture to control a business in a rapidly growing part of the world. Pinto: The opportunities in China are huge. You have a country that clearly is headed, in a slow way, towards deregulation, allowing foreign companies to have a majority stake in the financial services industry. It's a massive equity market, a massive bond market. The payments space is evolving extremely fast. So the opportunity is great. It will be a big contribution to J.P. Morgan and we will contribute to the Chinese market as the years go by and we keep growing our presence there. In particular, the joint venture will allow us to participate more deeply in the local equity markets, do underwritings, things like that. CNBC: Will China be your bank's second-biggest national market after the U.S. when it comes to revenue? How long will that take, a decade? Pinto: Yes. I have no doubt it will be, and it will happen a lot faster than 10 years. Bitcoin CNBC: Are cryptocurrencies another opportunity for you? Your competitors already help trade bitcoin futures and are preparing to get more involved in trading digital currencies. Pinto: We are looking into that space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. [Regarding bitcoin], you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities. That will have a very short life, because people will stop believing in it, or the regulators will kill it. I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form. If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No. CNBC: The current economic expansion is nearing a decade in age, double the average length. When does it end? Pinto: Obviously, there will be an end to the economic cycle at some point. I don't think it's coming any time soon. If you asked me when I thought the economy is going to slow down, I'd follow [JPMorgan Chief U.S. economist] Mike Feroli. He says that the probability of a recession is extremely low in 2018, it's higher in 2019, but still low. And it probably starts going up in 2020. CNBC: What would trigger a recession? Pinto: In the U.S., the risk is inflation. Does the Fed have to raise interest rates a lot faster than what the market is expecting or pricing in? For everything we can see, inflation is going up slightly, but in a very moderate way. That's why I think the probability of that happening this year or next year is relatively low. But the Fed will continue to hike, and at some point that hike in rates will slow down the U.S. economy. I don't believe that that is a crisis. It's just a correction at the end of the cycle that will trigger the beginning of the next cycle. Dealing with a bear market CNBC: You've said that within two or three years, the stock market could see a correction of 30 to 40 percent. How are you preparing the firm for this? Pinto: When you're going towards the end of the cycle, you want to have an extra layer of prudence. [In the investment bank] we're going to start being more careful about the liquidity of the book, about the concentration of illiquid risk, about the correlations, about how the positions will trade through different stress scenarios. You keep modeling the book to something that you hope, when the correction starts happening, you are well positioned to continue to be a player in the market, and you aren't shutting yourself out. The worst-case scenario for any big player is that you end up being massively hammered when the correction happens, and you end up losing money because of your positions. CNBC: Many Wall Street traders today are relatively young because after the financial crisis, firms sought to cut costs by eliminating more experienced, expensive talent. Is that a concern, for the industry, when conditions turn nasty? Pinto: All these people, whether they're senior or junior, lived in a bullish environment for the last 10 years. But I haven't, and many of my managers [have more experience], so we are prepared. CNBC: In the past decade, you've seen the rise of passive investments, the rise of computerized traders like quants, at the same time that regulations have curbed the ability for investment banks to deploy capital in markets. Will that impact the severity of the correction? Pinto: All these electronic, algorithmic traders, they provide a lot of liquidity in calm markets. So today, you can trade as much as you want every day. When the correction happens, these players tend to fall away, which exacerbates the moves. There's not as much smart capital [from investment banks] to really provide that rational support to market levels. That's why when the correction happens, or we have some kind of bad news, the market becomes very volatile and trading volumes shrink massively. We know how to prepare for those times, and over these days, we are slightly more conservative than we would've been a couple of years ago. We try to get through the difficult times as intact as possible to continue to provide liquidity to support the clients. That is in the minds of all the risk managers that we have, all my management team. Amazon as partner and competitor CNBC: Let's look a little further out. What about competition from tech firms like Amazon, which is reportedly looking to make a push into consumer banking by offering a checking account? Pinto: We work closely with Amazon. If there are things we can do together, we will try them. That doesn't preclude them from trying to be strong in financial services, to be strong in health care, in whatever they want to be, if they are allowed. The worst thing you can do is ignore it. You have to assume in some way or another, they will get involved. There's only one thing you can do. It's to create services that are as good as possible, and the best client experience, to have a shot. Ultimately, consumers will decide.

Barclays has spoken to its rival bank Standard Chartered about a potential merger but no formal or informal bid was made, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing two unnamed sources. Barclays told CNBC it has no comment on the report. Two unnamed sources close to the bank, cited by Reuters, said there was no truth in the rumor and it wasn't exploring any potential mergers with other lenders. Stanchart said it's \"entirely focused on executing our strategy, and [does] not comment on this type of speculation.\" The FT reported that one director each from the two London-headquartered banks met to discuss the possible benefits of merging. The conversation that took place was part of a wider effort by Barclays to improve its financial performance, according to the report. Barclays has come under pressure from activist investor Sherborne, which is pushing the British lender to shrink its under-performing investment banking unit, Reuters reported last week.

Comcast, CNBC's parent company, said in a statement that the offer would top the value of the deal with Disney, but no final decision has been made. It did say that efforts to finance the bid and submit key regulatory filings are \"well advanced.\" Shares of Comcast closed 1.9 percent lower Wednesday, while Disney shares fell 1.1 percent. Fox shares gained 1.6 percent. \"Everything I hear indicates that [Comcast CEO] Brian Roberts is extremely focused and aggressive in terms of wanting to own these assets,\" CNBC's David Faber said Wednesday on \"Squawk Box.\" However, Fox may find Comcast's bid less attractive than Disney's for tax reasons, Faber said, citing sources. Disney's stock offer would allow Fox to spin off its assets tax free, while a cash offer from Comcast would result in a taxable spin, the sources said. Disney announced an agreement in mid-December to acquire Fox's movie studios, the Nat Geo and FX networks, regional sports networks and other parts of the company for $52.4 billion in stock. The deal, which included stakes in Sky and Hulu, had a total value of about $66.1 billion. Such an acquisition would boost Disney's efforts to compete with Netflix in streaming. \"In a nutshell, if Comcast won these assets from the arms of Disney it would be a 'devastating blow' to [Disney CEO Bob] Iger and Disney's streaming ambitions going forward,\" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note Wednesday. Citing sources, CNBC reported earlier this month that Comcast was preparing to make a bid for the assets in mid-June. CNBC also reported that week that Comcast was preparing an all-cash bid of $60 billion, topping Disney's deal, if the government approved AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. Sources also told CNBC this month that Comcast could take on debt of up to $100 billion in the deal. The Fox assets under consideration do not include the Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company and certain other components.

According to forecasts from the bank's chief economist, the federal deficit will increase from $825 billion (or 4.1 percent of gross domestic product) to $1.25 trillion (5.5 percent of GDP) by 2021. And by 2028, the bank expects the number to balloon to $2.05 trillion (7 percent of GDP). \"An expanding deficit and debt level is likely to put upward pressure on interest rates, expanding the deficit further,\" Jan Hatzius \u2014 Goldman's chief economist \u2014 wrote Sunday. \"While we do not believe that the U.S. faces a risk to its ability to borrow or repay, the rising debt level could nevertheless have three consequences long before debt sustainability becomes a major obstacle.\" show chapters Goldman Sachs says there could be a significant jump in interest rates 4:23 PM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 01:00 Legislators passed a package of corporate and individual tax cuts in December, a two-year budget deal in February and a massive spending bill in March that boosted government expenditures on both domestic and military programs. In light of the big spending and easier tax burden, the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 Capitol Hill's nonpartisan financial scorekeeper \u2013 in April projected that debt could equal GDP within a decade if Congress extends the tax cuts, a level not seen since World War II. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Economic growth should jump above 3 percent in 2018 thanks to the stimuli, the CBO said, but the acceleration will likely prove brief, and debt held by the public will soar to $28.7 trillion by the end of fiscal 2028. That could create a precarious situation for Congress if the economy faces an economic downturn in the near term, Hatzius wrote, hampering legislators' ability provide additional fiscal stimulus. \"Lawmakers might hesitate to approve fiscal stimulus in the next downturn in light of the already substantial budget deficit,\" the economist said. \"While we would expect some additional loosening of fiscal policy during the next downturn, there is a good chance in our view that it would be less aggressive than it was in the last few recessions.\" But even if the debt and deficit levels don't prevent lawmakers from approving countercyclical fiscal stimulus during the next recession, a political desire to stabilize the debt level would likely arrest growth during the next recovery, the Goldman team explained. \"The current fiscal expansion ... must at some point give way not just to a neutral stance, which we expect by 2020, but to a tightening of fiscal policy that could restrict growth,\" Hatzius wrote. Finally, the economist explained that regardless of how much longer the current expansion persists, increasing deficits and debts naturally put upward pressure on interest rates, expanding the deficit further. According to estimates by Goldman Sachs, a 1 percentage point increase in the budget deficit raises the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 20 basis points when the economy is at or beyond full employment, as it appears to be currently. \"Surprises are clearly possible in both directions, but we believe the risks are tilted in the direction of larger deficits than projected,\" Hatzius concluded. \"While we expect Congress will eventually address the widening budget gap, it also seems quite likely to take longer than most market participants might expect.\" WATCH: Wall St. ignoring 'stealth slowdown' in economy show chapters Wall Street ignoring \u2018stealth slowdown\u2019 in economy, warns former super bull 4:44 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 01:46 Disclaimer ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/13/105131112-GettyImages-80639420.jpg?v=1523643130", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Santelli Exchange"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "12:30 PM ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "11"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "02:50"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "the United States"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Goldman Sachs"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$825 billion"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "4.1 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$1.25 trillion"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "5.5 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2021"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2028"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$2.05 trillion"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "7 percent"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jan Hatzius \u2014 Goldman's"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Sunday"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Goldman Sachs"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "PM ET Mon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "14 May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "01:00"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "December"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "two-year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "February"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "March"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 Capitol Hill's"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "April"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a decade"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Congress"}, {"category": "EVENT", "term": "World War II"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "500px;border"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "3 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CBO"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$28.7 trillion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the end of fiscal 2028"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Congress"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Hatzius"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Goldman"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2020"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Hatzius"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Goldman Sachs"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "1"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "10-year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Treasury"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "roughly 20"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Hatzius"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Congress"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "4:44 PM ET Mon"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "21"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Huge budget deficits and national debt could pose a threat to the country's economic security during the next recession, Goldman warned.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/goldman-sachs-the-fiscal-outlook-for-the-us-is-not-good.html", "author": "Getty Images", "title": "Goldman Sachs: The fiscal outlook for the US 'is not good'"}, {"time": "2018-05-22T19:21:58-0400", "body": " CNBC San Juan, Puerto Rico. U.S. lawmakers closed a long-standing legal loophole that helped spark a financial crisis in Puerto Rico that has decimated the savings of thousands of residents. Tucked inside legislation that passed the House of Representatives Tuesday night \u2014 a larger bill largely focused on rolling back Dodd-Frank banking regulation \u2014 is a provision that creates greater oversight of brokerage firms operating in U.S. territories. The provision ends a 78-year-old legislative loophole that allowed subsidiaries of global banking institutions that operated in U.S. territories, like Puerto Rico, to do certain types of financial transactions that are legally barred stateside. This exemption from the so-called Investment Company Act of 1940 also allowed funds in Puerto Rico to skirt leverage standards and certain affiliated party transactions that apply to funds operating in the U.S. The loophole allowed for Swiss banking giant UBS and other banks to underwrite specific Puerto Rico bonds and then sell them directly into bond funds that were sold only to island residents, a CNBC investigation, published in December, found. show chapters Bill does not weaken regulations for largest banks: Barney Frank 3:59 PM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 06:30 The funds, which were not registered with the SEC, were highly levered and concentrated largely in Puerto Rico bonds, which became practically worthless in recent years. The residents who bought them lost billions of dollars in savings. The legislation passed Tuesday repeals the exemption to ensure that financial institutions that operate in all U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have to abide by the same rules as their stateside counterparts. Funds issued and sold to investors by institutions in Puerto Rico will now need to be registered with the SEC. CNBC's investigation prompted Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) to call for a congressional hearing to investigate the marketing and sales practices of investment companies operating in Puerto Rico. Her office is expecting that the passage of Tuesday's bill will negate the need for such a hearing. Vel\u00e1zquez, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, had tried three times before, in 2015, 2016 and last year, to close the loophole. But her prior bills, which weren't part of a bigger legislative package, failed to pass. When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act of 1940, it was deemed too expensive for regulators with the SEC to travel to U.S. territories \u2014 which then also included Alaska and Hawaii, in addition to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since then, both Alaska and Hawaii have become states, air travel to and from Puerto Rico has become less expensive and a large portion of financial activity takes place electronically. That makes it far easier for regulators to patrol financial activities in U.S. territories than it was 78 years ago, Rep. Vel\u00e1zquez has argued. The bill, called the \"Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, passed on Tuesday. Velazquez said she voted no on it for other reasons. For example, the bill rolls back many protections for bank customers, including preventing discrimination against minorities in mortgage lending. It also raises the threshold for a bank to be considered systemically important to $250 billion in assets. It was seen as favorable to medium-sized U.S. banks by loosening some of the current rules. \"On balance, these are poor choices that, in my view, heighten the risk of improper financial activities similar to those that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis,\" Velazquez said in a statement. On-island financial institutions will have three years to comply with the new rules, assuming they get signed into law. The SEC has to option to grant an additional three years, if warranted. \"This bill will put Puerto Rico's mutual fund industry in regulatory parity with the Mainland and, at last, bring to an end decades of exploitation of Puerto Rican investors,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said in a written statement. \"I am heartened, at least, that by passing my legislation, as part of this larger package, we will no longer hear of the people of Puerto Rico being swindled out of their nest eggs due to an antiquated loophole in federal investment law.\" WATCH: 5 buys for Dodd-Frank overhaul show chapters Dodd-Frank

Being there, it became clear why the humble stock market sage likes it so much: It doesn't go out of its way to make a splash. Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, drives around in a car he reportedly bought for less than $50,000. He also lives in the same house he bought for $31,500 in 1958. For breakfast, Buffett goes to McDonald's, where he spends no more than $3.17, and eats alone. In many ways, Gorat's strikes the same modest, low-key vibe as Buffett. Fred Imbert | CNBC Nothing inside Gorat's (except for the TV at the bar) looks too modern or feels brand new. The paintings on the walls and the furniture are not flashy, either. Everything is simple and to the point. It's as if you were transported back to a simpler time. Perhaps that's on purpose. The restaurant was renovated about six years ago when it changed owners. Gene Dunn, the person who bought Gorat's in 2012, told the Omaha World-Herald in 2013 they \"took it back to what it was in the 1940s and '50s\" by taking out all of the decor from the 1970s. That included the dropped ceilings and carpeting, among other things. Fred Imbert | CNBC A constant, however, has been the quality of the food. When I went, I had their Omaha sirloin steak, a 10-ounce piece of meat topped with bleu cheese butter coupled with a side of french fries and some greens. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly and the waitress serving my table was very nice (as most people in Omaha seemed to be). Other options include a 14-ounce New York strip, lamb chops and a 14-ounce ribeye. More ambitious diners can opt for the 22-ounce Omaha T-bone steak, Buffett's personal favorite.

But Peter Costa, a governor at the New York Stock Exchange, said this is not the beginning of a bear market. \"You'll never see a bear market start with the Russell 2000 hitting an all-time high,\" Costa, president of NYSE trading firm Empire Executions, said on \"Closing Bell\" Thursday. \"It's never happened. It will never happen.\" In fact, the small-cap index closed at an all-time high of 1,625.29 on Thursday. The intraday level reached an all-time high of 1,627.32. Another sign of the strong economy is the yield curve, said John Burke, owner and manager of Burke Financial. He pointed out that so far in May the yield curve, or the spread between long- and short-term interest rates, has increased. \"The stock market has never come to a halt when the yield curve is getting steeper,\" Burke said on \"Closing Bell.\" Still, Thursday's trading session was a disappointing one for market watchers. All three major indexes closed lower. Some investors fear continued trade tensions may be the culprit. But Barbara Doran, director and senior portfolio manager at Yorkbridge Wealth Partners, disagreed. \"We're used to getting a lot of noise on the trade talks,\" she said on \"Closing Bell.\" Costa said the most likely outcome of the trade talks is \"some sort of compromise.\" \"There are advisors that are going to be a lot more vocal and [telling Trump], 'Look, this could be extremely detrimental, not only to the Chinese economy but to the U.S. economy and the world economy,'\" Costa said. Still, Burke said investors, including his firm, are \"most worried about\" political factors influencing the market. \"It's not just China.

Hedge fund manager David Tepper's reportedly record-breaking bid for the NFL's Carolina Panthers has left many wondering if the billionaire may see the franchise as a long-term investment play. The value of the average NFL franchise more than doubled in the decade from 2007 to 2017, climbing to $2.52 billion from $957 million, according to Forbes. And despite a long bull market in stocks, the S&P 500 has fallen short of doubling in value. It is up just 77 percent over the same time. Tepper's deal \u2013 which remains subject to NFL approval \u2013 is reportedly worth $2.2 billion, the most ever paid for a football franchise and dwarfing the $1.4 billion the Pegula family paid for the Buffalo Bills back in 2014. But while the deal represents a huge initial buyout, Tepper is likely betting on reliable returns. The Pegulas, for example, have seen the value of the Bills climb to $1.6 billion in just two years, netting $200 million more than their initial investment. But Tepper is also likely watching the industry as a whole as the way people enjoy football continues to evolve. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); One relatively recent prospect for football fanatics is the ability to watch games online, with Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all vying for an all-important rights contract in recent years. Last month, the NFL announced that it had reached an agreement to renew its exclusive partnership with Amazon Prime Video to deliver a live digital stream of \"Thursday Night Football.\" The battle for sports content has been heating up between the tech titans over the last few years. Facebook recently announced that it would exclusively stream 25 Major League Baseball games, while YouTube struck a deal with Los Angeles' Major League Soccer team. This is the second year Amazon has won a contract with the NFL, reportedly paying $50 million to stream the 10 Thursday night games last year. These burgeoning sources of revenue could prove the next step for the NFL in its quest to keep up with a younger audience. And that, in turn, could have been one of the reasons Tepper considered buying a sports franchise, according to CNBC contributor and Short Hills Capital Partners founder Stephen Weiss. \"There's always going to be a profit angle, a return on investment calculus,\" Weiss said. \"It still has to be profitable.\" Weiss, who's known Tepper and other owners of major sports franchises over the years, said that to assess viewership with the traditional measures may slowly be becoming an outdated model. \"You can't just go by viewership on the major networks, you have to go by other factors because you've got other avenues of revenue,\" Weiss added. \"You've got Amazon, you've got YouTube: That creates arguably even more of a bidding war as well as more ways to leverage the product.\" The Panthers deal also comes just after the Supreme Court's ruling allowing states to legalize sports gambling. While the NFL has long opposed legalized sports gambling, the allowance could potentially spell additional revenue sources. Commenting on the news this week, billionaire investor Mark Cuban said the decision is fantastic news for investors in the sports and gambling industries. \"I think everyone who owns a top four professional sports team just basically saw the value of their team double,\" the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks said in a \"Squawk Alley\" interview. \"It can finally become fun to go to a baseball game again.\" But while NFL continues on as the most lucrative league in the world, some Wall Street brokerages are growing concerned by a recent string of soft ratings and viewership reports. J.P. Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse both cited weaker ratings and viewership in notes to clients during the 2017-2018 season, explaining that the apparent decline in viewership could wind up affecting major broadcasters like Fox and ESPN. The weaker numbers were so concerning that Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh cut his earnings per share estimates on CBS for last year's third quarter. \"We expect third-quarter network advertising to decline 3 percent, driven by soft ratings for both the summer schedule and for the start of the NFL season,\" Sheikh wrote in October, only to be echoed by J.P. Morgan's Alexia Quadrani one month later. \"Ratings are down in 8 of 10 weeks this season,\" Quadrani wrote. \"We note that ratings picked up in 2016 starting in Week 10, which was the first post-Election Day slate of games.\" However, CBS ultimately posted mixed results for the third quarter 2017 and defended its partnership with the NFL in its earnings call. The NFL \"is still the best game in town,\" CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves said in November, echoing Fox Sports' Shanks. \"There's no better way for advertisers to reach a mass audience, and it still provides the best promotional platform to us to launch our new shows.\" Ultimately, the relatively soft viewership numbers in 2017 will likely do little to usurp the commanding leadership the NFL \u2013 and professional sports more broadly \u2013 has over the TV world. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); According to Nielsen data, seven of the 10 most popular live or single telecasts in 2017 through November were NFL events, with Super Bowl LI, the Super Bowl postgame, and the AFC Championship game claiming first, second and third place respectively. That trend is unlikely to end anytime soon, with the earliest 2018 numbers from Nielsen already showing the NFL at the top of the list yet again, likely adding comfort to Tepper in his bid for the Panthers. \"It's like owning a Picasso. There aren't many out there and they rarely come up for sale,\" said Joe Favorito, a Columbia University professor and strategic communications executive in New York. \"You can't find another business, no matter what you do, that if you just maintain it, it appreciates in value like this.\" The most recent surge in value, Favorito said, is likely due to the ruthless bidding war for media rights, driving up the league's massive annual haul. Though specific insights into the NFL's financial situation are limited, a financial disclosure by the Green Bay Packers \u2013 the only publicly owned franchise in major U.S. sports \u2013 revealed that the NFL distributed a record $7.8 billion to its 32 teams in 2016, according to Bloomberg. The sizable annual allowance \u2013 and its yearly increases \u2013 are a direct result of deals like that inked by Fox Sports in January. In exchange for the rights to broadcast the NFL's \"Thursday Night Football\" for the next five seasons, Fox will dole out $3 billion \u2013 or roughly $60 million per game \u2013 according to a Reuters source. That number is an increase from the $45 million per game CBS and Comcast's NBC were paying to broadcast rights during the last season, according to the source. \"You're talking about multi-year, multi-billion dollar media contracts,\" Favorito said. \"That's been the basis for teams that come in: There is a massive pool of assets for you to use.\" \"Every time there's a sale, a new bar is set.\" #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Disclosures: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

Nordstrom's stock plunged 7 percent in Friday's premarket after the company reported disappointing quarterly sales growth. The Seattle-based retailer said same-store sales \u2014 a key metric for retail companies \u2014 rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected an increase of 1.1 percent. Atlantic Equities analyst Daniela Nedialkova said in a note Friday the miss was driven by a weaker performance in Nordstrom's off-price business, which includes Nordstrom Rack. \"While this shortfall sparked the negative after-hours reaction, we see a positive in the continued acceleration of full-line. This is the second positive comp in a row from full-line, after a long period of negatives and a lack of consistency,\" Nedialkova said. The miss on same-store sales was enough to overshadow better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter. Nordstrom posted revenue of $3.56 billion and a profit of 51 cents per share. Nedialkova \u2014 who has an overweight rating on the stock and a price target of $58 \u2014 said the stock's decline represents a buying opportunity for investors.

American beef, corn and soybeans could benefit the most from the latest trade agreements between the U.S. and China. Over the weekend, the two countries issued a joint statement stating that both \"agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports,\" bringing temporary relief to a heated trade dispute. While analysts said the agreement isn't specific enough to have immediate economic impact, some noted key areas in which American farmers would likely benefit. \"We estimate a potential increase of US$60-90bn in Chinese purchases of US goods, with a rise in agriculture imports (particularly beef) in the near term,\" Morgan Stanley Economist Robin Xing, Strategist Michael Zezas and their team said in a note Sunday. show chapters How farmers feel about latest China trade talks 4:23 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 02:23 China reopened its market to U.S. beef in June 2017 for the first time in 14 years after negotiations earlier in the year between the Trump administration and Beijing. Chinese imports of beef globally increased more than nine-fold between 2012 and 2016, to $2.5 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \"Once [our Chinese distributors] get it they can't sell it fast enough. We can't supply them with enough beef right now,\" said Kent Bacus, director of international trade at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Beef accounts for six specific items on China's list of 106 U.S. goods that Beijing announced additional tariffs on in early April, in retaliation against the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Other items on the list include soybeans, corn and wheat. China has \"agriculture products on there to get attention and to inflict pain on key constituencies in the U.S.,\" said Gregory Husisian, chair of the international trade & national security group at Foley & Lardner. As a result, he expects the items targeted by Beijing will be the Trump administration's focus in negotiating details on trade with Beijing. Agriculture overall is strategically a key area for Beijing to work with the U.S. China is the second largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, at $19.6 billion in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service. It's an area in which \"China can quickly show results,\" Husisian said. \"They could just shift purchases from Europe or other countries fairly easily. From their perspective it represents one that doesn't really require them to do that much.\" China has made some concessions on agriculture already. Beijing said Friday it was ending an investigation into imports of U.S. sorghum. The probe had effectively halted trade worth roughly $1.1 billion in 2017. Further agreements on U.S. agriculture exports will need similar specifics on product type and amount for a deal to be economically effective, analysts said. Even in the growing beef market, Bacus said Chinese restrictions on imports of the meat injected with hormones or fed \"beta-agonists\" makes it difficult for U.S. exporters. \"We are not anywhere close to reaching our potential in that market,\" Bacus said. President Donald Trump does appear focused on improving the trade environment for U.S. agriculture. He focused two of his tweets Monday on the weekend trade deal on the industry: \"Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,\" Trump tweeted. \"There's a relief for American farmers here because we were headed towards a situation where the Chinese were going to block imports of U.S. goods,\" said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist at the China Beige Book. However, the latest developments are just \"a restoration of the status quo.\" \"If you're playing defense, you're trying to protect the soybean trade. If you're playing offense\" you will name a particular product, Scissors said. \"The test is whether we're going to get specific goods being mentioned.\" WATCH: How Chinese businesses can adapt to

Insights chief strategist 7:05 AM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 | 01:53 Dell has begun talking to holders of its VMware-tracking stock, DVMT, to gauge their interest on a merger with VMware, according to people familiar with the matter. Dell remains bullish on VMware's future and wants to own as much of the stock as possible, and also wants to clean up the virtualization pioneer's capital structure, which has been complicated by a series of mergers and partial spin-outs, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Dell Technologies released a filing Thursday saying it is still weighing an initial public offering, a merger with VMware or doing nothing. Dell added a fourth possible option -- \"a potential conversion of shares of Class V Common Stock of Dell into shares of DHI Common Stock of Dell.\" In other words, Dell is considering exchanging its common stock, which today is privately held by Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake, for shares of the publicly traded tracker, DVMT. To that end, Dell wants to suss out the thoughts of the DVMT tracker holders, which include hedge funds D.E. Shaw and Elliott Management, before it moves forward with any transaction, the people said. Dell wants to know whether these owners would prefer to hold complete shares of Dell, rather than shares of a stock that tracks only the performance of VMware within Dell. A DHI common share is an ownership stake in all of Dell, including EMC, the personal computer business, and Dell's ownership position in VMware. VMware has a complicated ownership structure. Currently, Dell owns 82 percent of VMware. Of that portion, 50 percent is held by owners of the tracking stock DVMT. The other 32 percent is held by founder Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake, the owners of Dell's DHI. Michael Dell and Silver Lake took Dell Technologies private in 2013 and later acquired EMC (which owned a big stake in VMware) in 2016. That $67 billion deal still stands as the largest pure technology acquisition ever. The remainder of VMware is traded publicly as VMW. Last month, activist investor Carl Icahn acquired a stake in VMware below the mandatory 5 percent threshold for disclosure, according to people familiar. Icahn attempted to thwart Michael Dell's 2013 effort to take Dell private. Dell is unlikely to pursue an exchange of DHI for DVMT if the holders of the tracking stock don't want to move forward with a VMware deal, one of the people said. Dell loves the VMware business and wants to own the entire company, the people said. A reverse merger where combined Dell-VMware shares trade publicly would also allow Silver Lake to monetize its investment of Dell on the public market. A deal that eliminates the tracker stock could simplify a VMware merger, as Dell could then negotiate a straight 1-for-1 exchange ratio with VMware holders. Dell doesn't need to legally give VMware holders a so-called \"majority of the minority\" vote on a deal, although it would prefer to include one, two of the people said. While VMware has a special committee working on its behalf to ensure a fair transaction, a majority of the minority vote is a \"nice-to-have, but not a must-have,\" one of the people said. Dell continues to work on a complex valuation process, where it must calculate a fair value for itself and the relative exchange values for the tracker stock and VMware shares.

Apple's iPhone X demand remains soft while the latest look into its services business growth proved \"good not great,\" according to Nomura Instinet. Analysis of recent iPhone average selling prices \u2014 a key metric offering insight into the generations of iPhones being sold \u2014 implied a thinner mix of iPhone X volumes than hoped, analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a note to clients Monday. \"iPhone volumes are not deteriorating though iPhone X remains uninspiring,\" Kvaal wrote. \"Apple guidance implied third fiscal-quarter iPhone unit volumes that were better than feared. We do not believe, however, sell through has meaningfully improved.\" Kvaal, who maintained his neutral rating on shares of the technology company, said part of the problem stems from a decline in the rate of phone upgrades, with the average upgrade rate at the major U.S. telecommunication companies slipping to 5.3 percent in the first quarter of the calendar year. The analyst sees Apple slumping 6 percent from last week's close to $175 over the next 12 months. \"We see little reason for [the upgrade rate] to improve in the near term,\" he added. \"None of the carriers appear particularly distraught by the lower gross adds \u2014 and lower churn \u2014 that accompanies the lower upgrade rate. Verizon expects to remain disciplined and Sprint also expects to be less promotional.\" Kvaal also argued that while Apple's services business should continue to grow at a solid pace, Wall Street would be better able to assess the impact of the segment if the company were more forthcoming about its revenue generation. Services revenue has consistently grown above 20 percent on an annualized basis, with recent strength in licensing, App Store, and AppleCare keeping the progress on track. Still, Kvaal isn't entirely convinced. \"Apple has made several sustainable improvements to the Services growth trajectory,\" he said, \"[but] we believe the tailwind from licensing and from AppleCare may ease in coming quarters. ... We would appreciate better disclosure from Apple on its Services business to help gauge revenue growth.\" Shares have gained roughly 10 percent this month, rallying after both strong earnings performance and guidance as well as an additional investment from Warren Buffett, who revealed that Berkshire Hathaway bought an additional 75 million shares. The stock's price was $186.31 as of Friday's close, implying a market cap of $915 billion and within $20 of making Apple the first company to ever reach a value of $1 trillion. The stock closed at an all-time high of $190.04 on May 10. In was up 1.3 percent Monday morning.

Morgan. \"With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,\" analyst Stephen Tusa said in a note to clients Tuesday. Hoping to ease such concerns, the besieged industrial conglomerate announced Monday its decision to merge its transportation business with Wabtec in a transaction valued at $11.1 billion. Wall Street applauded the announcement as the stock closed up nearly 2 percent Monday. show chapters GE to merge transportation unit with Wabtec 3:14 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 02:31 And while General Electric will receive $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close, J.P. Morgan believes the company remains well short of a healthy balance sheet. \"Even after transportation, we see the need for roughly $32 billion in capital to mathematically hit 2.5x leverage, well in excess of the initial $20 billion 'in value' investors had been treating as a silver bullet, and a target GE is clearly missing,\" Tusa added. General Electric did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The transportation deal is the first major step for CEO John Flannery, who took the reins last August. The CEO is in the middle of a strategic review of the company that could lead to other segment separations before the company stabilizes. The company also cut its quarterly payout in half last year in an effort to free up some cash. The transportation unit \u2014 which largely builds trains \u2014 is one of the company's smaller units, representing slightly more than 3 percent of GE's total revenue, according to FactSet data. \"The offset to these negatives has simply been yet another change in how the company reports adjusted EPS, and related guidance that is 'unchanged,' with a series of restatements that helped to further obfuscate,\" Tusa wrote. \"If the outcome of the next several months is more complex, financially engineered moves short on cash, and built on promises around future growth, on the back of perpetually adjusted numbers, we scratch our heads as to how that cannot be juxtaposed to the 'fresh start/reset' narrative.\" The analyst reiterated his underweight rating on the stock as well as his 12-month price target of $11, implying 27 percent downside over the next year. GE's stock is down more than 45 percent in the past 12 months through Monday's close versus the S&P 500's nearly 15 percent return. It was up 1.4 percent on Tuesday.

Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April. The digital currency dropped 8.7 percent to a low of $7,512.43 as of 12:30 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk. All other major cryptocurrencies were also in the red despite bullish callsthat prices would skyrocket after a week of major blockchain events in New York City. Analysts at Fundstrat predicted bitcoin would rally as much as 69 percent as a result of \"Blockchain Week,\" yet the cryptocurrency has fallen about 13 percent since those conferences kicked off. Some pundits pointed to regulatory news as the key driver of this week's sell-off. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announceda widespread crackdown on some cryptocurrency investment schemes, led by the North American Securities Administrators Association. More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in what's being called \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far. \"This cleaned out a lot of the bad projects,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies. \"That has people a little concerned, and is a short-term hit to sentiment.\" Long-term though, Kelly said it's part of the maturation this market needs for institutional investors to buy in. \"The projects that they shut down they appear to be junk, they had a real reason to shut them down,\" Kelly said. Unlike stock markets, the nascent cryptocurrency market typically takes a few days to digest news before it triggers a sell-off, Kelly said. This week's crackdown comes amid growing attention in the U.S. to cryptocurrency scams by U.S. regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several fraud casesagainst operators of initial coin offerings and last week launcheda website to help investors recognize scams. Bitcoin has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year, after an epic 1,300 percent rise to near $20,000 in 2017. The top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also sold off significantly Wednesday. Ethereum dropped 13 percent, XRP was down 11 percent and bitcoin cash fell 14 percent. Jack Tatar, co-author of \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,\" said this sell-off could be a sign that a shakeout is coming for digital currencies. \"I think you're going to start to see some consolidation around many of the smaller cryptoassets,\" Tatar said. \"That may not be a bad thing for the overall crypto community as I'm seeing more critical examination of altcoins, their utility and overall value.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/15/104901516-GettyImages-892695698-bitcoin.jpg?v=1513350687", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jaap Arriens"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "NurPhoto"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Bydgoszcz"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Poland"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "two-week"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "8,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "mid April"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "8.7 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "7,512.43"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "12:30 p.m. ET"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "CoinDesk"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a week"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York City"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "as much as 69 percent"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "about 13 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "week"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Canada"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "More than 40"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Operation Crypto-Sweep"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "at least 70"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Brian Kelly"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BKCM"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kelly"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kelly"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a few days"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kelly"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "week"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Securities and Exchange Commission"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "nearly 40 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "1,300 percent"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "ten"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "13 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "11 percent"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "14 percent"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jack Tatar"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Innovative Investor's Guide"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Beyond"}], "description": "Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-drops-9-percent-now-back-below-8000.html", "author": "Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000"}, {"time": "2018-05-18T16:22:18-0400", "body": " Gary Hershorn | Getty Images Construction workers work on the roof of Three World Trade Center high over Manhattan and Brooklyn on April 5, 2017, in New York City. It's finally happening. More than 16 years after the World Trade Center tragedy, a major component of the rebuilt WTC site is getting ready to open. 3 World Trade Center will be opening in early June, with lead tenants including music streaming firm Spotify and advertising giant GroupM. It will join 1 and 4 World Trade Center, the other two major buildings on the site, along with 7 World Trade Center on Greenwich Street. The completion of this phase of the World Trade Center comes as the Financial District of New York is experiencing a renaissance. I was at the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11 tragedy and worked at the NYSE in the immediate years after. The Financial District was filled with vacancies and remained relatively sparsely populated in those years. And then, it began to change. \"It's a very different neighborhood than it was in 2001\u2014 it's very different than it was even five years ago,\" Jessica Lappin, president of Alliance for Downtown New York, told me. \"We still have financial firms, but what's been amazing is to see tech, media, advertising firms \u2014 companies like Spotify and Group M \u2014 move down here as well and really change the face of the workforce and the feel of the neighborhood.\" Today, the commercial vacancy rate is below 10 percent, thanks to the infusion of those tech, media and advertising firms like Omnicom Media. And many people now call it home: 61,000 people live in the Financial District, more than ever before, most of them young professionals. And there are tourists galore, so many you can barely walk down some streets. Nearly 14 million came downtown in 2017 to visit Wall Street and the 9/11 Memorial, an 8 percent increase from 2016. The hotel business is booming as well: there are 7,000 hotel rooms in 32 hotels downtown, with another 2,000 under construction. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub, known as the \"Oculus,\" was completed two years ago and serves 250,000 commuters a day. The formerly rundown Seaport District is bustling with new shops and businesses, including new restaurants by Jean-Georges Vongerichten and David Chang. Live Nation is opening a 3,400-person rooftop entertainment complex in August that will kick off with performances by Amy Schumer. Sports television giant ESPN also unveiled its new production studios on Pier 17. Plus, construction on the Ronald O. Perlman Performing Arts Center began last year, and it is expected to open in 2020. As for the Trade Center, it's taken awhile, but the nearly 8 million square feet of space at the three main buildings is slowly being filled. 1 World Trade Center is now nearly 80 percent leased. Even the newly opening 3 World Trade center is nearly 40 percent leased, and 4 World Trade Center is 100 percent leased. With so much going on, downtown leaders are trying to improve traffic flows around the New York Stock Exchange, a major business, tourist and business destination.

According to Yale University senior fellow Stephen Roach, the threat is still real, and it could take a big bite out of stocks. \"The bottom line is China has been one of President Trump's core economic issues, and I'd be surprised if he just capitulates on this,\" Roach told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Wednesday. \"We have to look at the risk of some type of trade tensions very seriously.\" Roach, who was Morgan Stanley Asia chairman for five years, said it's hard to have confidence in White House trade policy when Trump administration officials are constantly changing their minds. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that trade talks with China have yielded \"very meaningful progress.\" About 24 hours later, President Donald Trump contradicted Mnuchin \u2014 declaring he wasn't satisfied with the recent trade discussions. \"The Treasury secretary says one thing, one day. And, the president says something the next day,\" Roach said. \"It's, sort of, back and forth in terms of getting clear and direct messages in what to make of this.\" Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on China as retaliation for a mammoth trade imbalance and alleged thefts of U.S intellectual property. Roach doesn't think the White House approach would be effective. \"Tariffs are a bad thing. Trade wars are not easy to win, as the president seems to suggest,\" he added. Roach warned it could have dire consequences for a stock market that's already vulnerable to another steep pullback. \"We had a valuation spike early this year. The market moved up parabolically in 2017. We've come off a little bit in the last four months,\" Roach said. \"But the price-earnings ratio that I look at cyclically, the adjusted price-earnings ratio, is still overextended by any standard of the imagination.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

The lowered duties will take effect July 1 and come after the Trump administration agreed this weekend to hold off on imposing tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods.

Of the top 10 brands by sales during that time, Volkswagen-affiliated sedans accounted for six, the association said. The only American brand on the list was General Motors' Buick.

Following the May 1-2 session, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said it wasn't raising rates yet but added the word \"symmetric\" to describe its inflation goal. Market participants since have puzzled over what the change in language might imply. The summary released Wednesday indicates a substantial level of debate over how the Fed should approach inflation. The minutes also pointed to an interest rate hike at the June meeting amid debate over how close the Fed might be getting to the end of this rate-hiking cycle. Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference March 21, 2018 in Washington, DC. While the general sentiment was that inflation would continue to rise toward the 2 percent target, there was disagreement over how confident the Fed should be after years of undershooting, and what that would mean to policy. However, there seemed to be agreement that after years of subpar growth and low inflation, allowing the economy to rev up a little would be appropriate. \"A few participants commented that recent news on inflation, against a background of continued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth, supported the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move slightly above the Committee's 2 percent objective for a time,\" the minutes said. \"It was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee's symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.\" 'Symmetric' \"Symmetric\" was mentioned at least nine times in the minutes. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures index, currently is at 1.9 percent, while the headline rate including energy and food prices is at 2 percent. Fed officials described wage pressures as \"moderate\" though it noted there has been more pressure in industries where labor supply is tightening. Fed officials see 2 percent inflation as a level that sustains economic growth without putting too much upward pressure on prices. After seven years of keeping its benchmark interest rate near zero, the FOMC began raising rates in December 2015, with the current target range at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. As the economy has seen growth above its recovery trend and inflation inches its way toward the Fed's goal, market participants have been speculating on how quickly the Fed will continue to hike and when it will stop. A few members stated that the Fed is getting close to its \"neutral\" goal of setting a rate that is neither constrictive nor overly expansionary to growth. Though Fed officials indicated in March that a total of three rate hikes this year were likely, traders in the fed funds futures market in recent days briefly put chances of a fourth hike above 50 percent. That probability has since declined to about 43 percent. The minutes indicate that central bank officials remain determined to keep increasing rates, but with the gradual approach that it has repeatedly pledged to take. June hike? \"Most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate for the Committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation,\" the minutes said in an indication that another hike is likely soon. Markets already had been pricing in a 95 percent chance of a quarter-point move at the June FOMC session, followed by another increase in September. The Fed's rate is tied closely to most forms of consumer debt. Along with the approach to inflation, some Fed officials also suggested that changes will be coming to what has become boilerplate language in post-meeting statements. Specifically, those members said that as rate hikes continue, adjustments may have to be made to phrasing that the \"federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run\" and another phrase that for years has said \"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\" However, the minutes also noted that members \"expressed a range of views\" on how policy should proceed. Positive economic outlook On the economy, committee members said their opinions had changed little as they expect continued progress despite some signs of softening in the first quarter. There was concern expressed over trade and fiscal issues, with Fed business contacts expressing \"concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and trade restrictions, including the potential for postponing or pulling back on capital spending.\" The outlook otherwise was positive. \"They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad,\" the minutes said. As things progress, \"further gradual increases\" in rates would be possible without disrupting the recovery and while sustaining the \"symmetric\" inflation goal.

His successor, Christian Sewing, the fourth CEO in six years, has signaled that the bank will scale back its business that deals with hedge funds, and the trading of stocks will also be affected, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The company had already announced large-scale restructuring to focus on direct links with European companies, and said it plans to scale back U.S. rates sales and trading, which would result in significant job losses, the bank said. Two executives are also reportedly leaving the bank: London-based head of CEEMEA equity sales Darren Veenhuis, and Pascal Moura, who heads up equity research in Dubai. The bank declined CNBC's request for comment.

Banking regulation has gotten stricter and more transparent in the days since the financial crisis, though more adjustments are likely ahead, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday. The central bank chief cited stress testing as one particular area where openness has both helped stabilize the financial system and given the public more confidence that institutions are prepared for the next crisis. \"In the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system,\" Powell said in a speech delivered in Stockholm at the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, on the past and future of central banking, according to prepared remarks. show chapters Powell 'very clear' on rates, says economist 9:23 AM ET Mon, 9 April 2018 | 03:28 Stress tests \"have placed special demands on transparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the public. The framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to new ways to enhance transparency and accountability.\" His speech did not delve into monetary policy and offered no clues as to how he feels about where interest rates are headed. Instead, Powell reviewed the progress made since the financial crisis exploded in 2008. He said the new rules come amid \"a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions in many places around the world.\" Since the crisis, regulators have required banks to carry increased capital levels and to lessen their risk-taking. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a bill that rolls back some of those regulations, largely in an effort to make the rules less onerous for regional and community banks. Powell largely praised the post-crisis steps, though he said progress has to continue in reviewing the rules to make sure they're working as intended. \"At the Fed, we are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis reforms,\" he said. \"The post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar. Some of these new policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and challenging for all involved. As a result, transparency and accountability around financial stability tools present particular challenges.\" Powell promised to continue to review how the regulatory framework is communicated to the public and banks. \"While future innovations may well improve the delivery of financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of potential future systemic vulnerabilities. We will need to keep up with the pace of innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability,\" he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech this week that blockchain \u2014 the technology underlying bitcoin \u2014 has \"breakthrough\" applications. \"A new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications,\" he said Monday, according to a translation of his remarks. Xi also emphasized the need for China to focus on technological development and become the global center of science and innovation. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known application of blockchain. The technology eliminates the need for a third party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a secure and permanent record of transactions between two parties. Speculation on the enormous but still largely unproven potential of blockchain helped send bitcoin prices skyrocketing last year. Beijing has effectively halted bitcoin trading domestically, and in September officially banned sales of new digital tokens through the \"initial coin offering\" process. However, the country remains a hub of activity for blockchain development. Several start-ups are partnering with the local Chinese government to research or implement the technology. \"In China, blockchain's still developing, really great,\" said Albert Xuan, project manager at Liaoyuan, a consulting firm and incubator for start-ups. He said roughly 100 to 200 people flew from China to New York earlier this month to attend Liaoyuan's \"Blockchain Without Borders\" conference, which drew about 650 people and held at least two panels in Mandarin Chinese.

Indeed, the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers last year made the most money they have in four years, collectively $15.38 billion, according to Institutional Investor, which has ranked managers by annual earnings for the last 17 years. That works out to an average of $615 million per manager, an increase of 40 percent from the previous year. It took $225 million just to make it into the most recent ranking, up from $130 million in 2016 and $135 million in 2015. The average hedge fund is doing better, and managers are generating bigger returns than 2016, when about half of them lost money or only made it into the single digits as far as investment gains, Institutional Investor said. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index was up 8.59 percent last year, versus 5.44 percent the year before. So far this year, the index is up 0.39 percent. The Institutional Investor ranking includes gains on managers' own capital invested in their fund and their share of the firms' total fees. Making it onto the list largely depends on gains on their own capital. James Simons of Renaissance Technologies topped the list at $1.7 billion. Next were Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, at $1.5 billion, Citadel's Kenneth Griffin at $1.4 billion and Bridgewater Associates' Raymond Dalio at $1.3 billion. Renaissance's funds beat their historical average, with double-digit gains, while the next three managers fell short of their own averages, but they have so much of their own wealth tied up in their funds that they were able to reap gains from their own capital, Institutional Investor noted. Tepper more than doubled his personal earnings last year even though Appaloosa's 13 percent gain lagged the S&P 500 and the fund's 30 percent historical annualized gain. The manager, who vaulted to second place from fifth the year before, had big bets last year on Micron Technology, Facebook and Alphabet, as well as the debt and equity of Caesars Entertainment that contributed to the gains. Tepper recently won the bidding for the NFL's Carolina Panthers, agreeing to pay $2.2 billion. Griffin also more than doubled his earnings last year. Dalio earned slightly less than he did the prior year and slipped from second to fourth in the ranking, but Institutional Investor points out that management fees helped keep him in the top five. Bridgewater's Pure Alpha I and II funds were each up about 1.2 percent compared with the strategy's annualized 11.9 percent gain since 1991. That means Dalio didn't generate his money based on returns or performance fees. Instead, at $108 billion, the world's largest hedge fund firm is able to generate a huge pot of management fees, Institutional Investor said. Third Point's Dan Loeb moved up to seventh from 12th place, making $625 million last year on his best returns since 2013.

But a Goldman Sachs strategist says it's not time to worry just yet. David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note Friday that investors should not worry about rising borrowing costs and their effect on stock valuations until the 10-year Treasury yield zeroes in on 4 percent. The benchmark note yielded 3.07 percent on Monday. \"A rise in interest rates should lead to a fall in equity prices, all else equal. An equity's value is equal to the present value of a perpetual stream of future dividends, which are highly sensitive to the discount rate,\" said Kostin. \"However, lower equity prices are not an inevitable consequence of higher interest rates. We expect negative valuation changes if the level of rates approaches 4%.\" He also said stock prices could take a hit before that level is reached if rates rise too rapidly. show chapters Goldman Sachs chief strategist: The economy will continue to grow this year and next year 10:35 AM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 02:12 Yields have been rising as investors fear that inflationary pressures in the U.S. will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than expected. The 10-year yield hit 3.11 percent last week \u2014 its highest level since 2011 \u2014 while the two-year yield hovered around a near-decade high. \"The actual impact of interest rate changes on equity prices depends on the reason interest rates are rising. If interest rates rise in anticipation of faster economic activity, this could lift growth expectations and also lower the equity risk premium,\" noted Kostin. The 10-year yield had risen about 71 basis points year to date through Friday, Kostin points out. Stocks, however, have weathered the sharp rise in yields thus far. Entering Monday's session, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were up 1.5 percent and 6.5 percent for the year, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. The small-caps Russell 2000, meanwhile, hit an all-time intraday high Monday and is up 6,6 percent in 2018. \"Assuming no valuation change, strong earnings and dividend growth will lift the S&P 500 index to our year-end 2018 target of 2850,\" said Kostin. The strategist added he recommended investors overweight the financials sector, which benefits from rising interest rates. Financials highlighted by Kostin include Bank of America, Wells Fargo, State Street and Capital One Financial.

{"time": "2018-05-21T14:25:49-0400", "body": " Michele Limina | Bloomberg | Getty Images Paul Achleitner, chairman of Deutsche Bank AG FRANKFURT \u2014 Ever since he was a 38-year-old Goldman Sachs executive helping to auction off bankrupt East German factories, Paul Achleitner has been known as a relentless modernizer shaking up Germany's sleepy corporate world. Now Mr. Achleitner is being cast in a new role: the man responsible for the sorry state of one of Germany's most important industries. Mr. Achleitner has been the chairman of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board since 2012, overseeing the company's top management and signing off on major business decisions. As the bank stumbles from one crisis to the next, investors blame him for the missteps that have brought the company to one of the most perilous moments in its nearly 150-year history. More from the New York Times: UK unlikely to block Comcast's proposed sky takeover, minister says How one company scammed Silicon Valley. And how it got caught. UK court dismisses charges over Qatar fund-raising by Barclays It is the latest blow to the reputation of a man who had been one of Germany's most renowned bankers since the fall of communism. Mr. Achleitner is increasingly viewed as responsible for a series of ill-fated mergers and questionable decisions over the past two decades that have left Germany, and indeed all of Europe, without a serious rival to the likes of Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Even today, Mr. Achleitner \u2014 who is not German, but Austrian \u2014 embodies corporate Germany. In addition to his role at Deutsche Bank, he sits on the oversight boards of three other blue-chip German companies, including the automaker Daimler. Friends and acquaintances describe him as a master networker who is quick to reply to text messages and has a knack for making people feel important. Mr. Achleitner's wife, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, a professor of business at the Technical University of Munich, also sits on the supervisory boards of several large German corporations. They are one of Germany's premier power couples. But Mr. Achleitner's grasp on power appears increasingly tenuous. When Deutsche Bank's shareholders gather for the company's annual meeting on Thursday, one of the items on the agenda will be a motion to oust Mr. Achleitner. Mr. Achleitner is expected to survive, at least for now, protected partly because the bank's chief executive, John Cryan, was ousted just last month. The departure of Mr. Achleitner could throw the bank into even greater turmoil. Mr. Achleitner, who declined to comment for this article, should be given \"one last chance,\" Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises investors on how to vote, said in a report this month. Removing Mr. Achleitner could distract the supervisory board from \"the truly precarious situation at hand: the entire future strategy and survival of the bank.\" Mr. Achleitner made a name for himself in the 1990s when the German government was selling assets like chemical factories that had belonged to the Communist government of East Germany. Other German bankers turned up their noses. But Mr. Achleitner, who was the first native German speaker to run Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, recognized an opportunity. He used the assignment to forge political and corporate ties and establish Goldman as a player in Germany. Mr. Achleitner's approach paid off in 1994 when Deutsche Telekom, the German telephone monopoly, prepared to sell shares to the public for the first time. The German government chose Goldman Sachs to be one of three banks handling the large share sale, alongside Germany's Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank. Goldman's lead role came as a rude awakening to the German banks, which had taken it for granted that they would share such transactions among themselves. That led Deutsche Bank in particular to hastily bulk up in investment banking to fend off foreign competitors. One fateful result was Deutsche Bank's purchase of Bankers Trust in 1998 for $10.1 billion. The transaction instantly made Deutsche Bank a presence on Wall Street, as well as the biggest bank in the world by assets. Goldman Sachs advised Deutsche Bank on the transaction, with Mr. Achleitner playing a supporting role as head of the Frankfurt office. The Bankers Trust deal was troubled from the start. The price was considered steep for a bank that had recently suffered a series of scandals, including accusations of selling derivatives without warning customers about the risks. show chapters Deutsche Bank\u2019s Achleitner: Fundamental challenge is credit pricing 6:02 AM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 | 02:22 But Mr. Achleitner's reputation as a dealmaker continued to grow. In 2000, he left Goldman to become chief financial officer at Allianz, the German insurer. Back then, Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank owned stakes in one another as well as in many of the largest German companies and dominated their supervisory boards. The network was unofficially known as Germany Inc., and scared away foreign investors. Mr. Achleitner's job was to either unload Allianz's holdings or find a way to make them more valuable. Among Allianz's biggest stakes was 21 percent of Dresdner Bank, one of Germany's biggest banks. First Mr. Achleitner tried to orchestrate a merger between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank, in which Allianz also owned a stake. When that idea was torpedoed by investment bankers at Deutsche Bank, he took a different tack, engineering Allianz's 2001 acquisition of the majority of Dresdner. The plan was to use the bank's retail network to sell insurance products. But Dresdner's huge portfolio of problematic loans left Allianz financially vulnerable. In 2002, after reporting a \u20ac2.5 billion loss in the third quarter, the company found itself in serious trouble. Still, Mr. Achleitner managed to emerge from the crisis as a hero. In 2003, he arrived late to a management board meeting in Munich. He looked weary and unshaven, according to Emilio Galli Zugaro, the former head of communications for Allianz who was present at the meeting. Mr. Achleitner had just come from an all-night negotiating session in Hamburg with potential buyers of Allianz's stake in Beiersdorf, a German company best known as the maker of Nivea face cream. Allianz badly needed the cash. A group of German investors had agreed to pay \u20ac4.4 billion for the Beiersdorf shares, Mr. Achleitner reported. The Allianz executives, normally a restrained group, gave Mr. Achleitner a standing ovation. The Dresdner Bank deal, however, remained a problem for Allianz. In August 2008, as a global financial crisis gathered force, Allianz sold Dresdner to Commerzbank. The price was \u20ac9.8 billion, less than half of Dresdner Bank's value when Allianz acquired its stake in 2001. Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis. Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry's worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions. Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner's backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues. Mr. Achleitner insisted that Europe needed a counterweight to the big American investment banks. \"If we don't watch out,\" he said in an interview with a German magazine in May 2015, \"we'll have the same American dominance that we already have in the internet.\" Weeks later, the bank's co-chief executive, Anshu Jain, one of the architects of the investment bank, resigned under pressure from shareholders and regulators unhappy with the way the bank had responded to government investigations. Mr. Achleitner chose Mr. Cryan, his colleague on the supervisory board, to succeed Mr. Jain. Mr. Cryan tried to refine Deutsche Bank's strategy and to instill a more ethical corporate culture. Less than three years into Mr. Cryan's tenure, Mr. Achleitner grew disenchanted. He contacted a number of executives at rival financial institutions to gauge their interest in taking over as chief executive. In late March, Mr. Achleitner was on an Amazon River cruise with his family when The Times of London reported that he had secretly been talking to possible replacements for Mr. Cryan. Mr. Achleitner rushed back to Frankfurt. Mr. Cryan was in limbo for more than a week. Mr. Achleitner remained silent. Finally, in early April, the board voted to replace him with Christian Sewing, a risk expert who has spent his entire career at the bank. Mr. Sewing quickly announced plans to scale back the investment bank. But Deutsche Bank is years behind European rivals in reorienting itself toward other lines of business that are less prone to scandal and losses. \"There have been a series of missteps going back quite a while, and I do think Chairman Achleitner is part of the problem,\" said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership at Yale School of Management. \"At some point someone should be accountable.\" ", "urlToImage":

He added that the stock should be able to appreciate 2.5 to threefold over the next five to six years.

Ant Financial Services Group, operator of China's biggest online payment platform by market share, Alipay, has closed its latest funding round having raised $10 billion from a clutch of global and local investors, five people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Ant's first fundraising targeting global money values the firm at $150 billion, the people said, compared with about $60 billion after its previous fundraising in April 2016. A number of global sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms joined the fundraising as main investors. They include Singapore's sovereign fund GIC Pte Ltd and state investor Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd, as well as U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL], the people said. show chapters Ant Financial nears $10 billion equity raise, sources tell CNBC 7:16 AM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 | 01:45 Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd has also joined as a major investor, one of the people said. The funding round also brought in private equity firm Carlyle Group LP and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which typically invests in early-stage start-ups, three of the people said. The amount and investor line-up are finalized and the transfer of funds is underway, the people said. The funding round includes a separate tranche of around 7 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in new shares which has not been finalized, two of the people said. The people spoke to Reuters on condition they not be identified as the deal details are not yet public. Ant, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma, declined to comment. Carlyle, Temasek and Warburg declined to comment. Khanazah, GIC and Sequoia Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The capital-raising comes ahead of a widely expected initial public offering (IPO), though Ant has neither publicly set a timetable nor chosen a likely stock exchange. A $150 billion valuation would make Ant's IPO one of the biggest ever - comparing to the $104 billion of Facebook Inc six years ago and Alibaba's $168 billion in 2014. A fundraising document seen by Reuters showed Ant planned to list both in China and Hong Kong in 2019, and its investors joining the latest fundraising could expect to exit within one to three years. Ant declined to comment on the document. Strong demand from investors looking to position themselves ahead of Ant's potential IPO has resulted in a much higher amount than an initial target of up to $5 billion, which Reuters earlier reported. Four-year-old Ant, which was spun off from Alibaba when the group went public in New York, has diversified over the years into credit services, asset management and online banking, besides owning the Alipay payment platform. After becoming a dominant in payments in China, the company has also invested in a number of internet-based startups including Chinese bike-sharing company Ofo, food delivery app operator Ele.me and Indian payment company PayTM. The firm counts China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, state lender China Construction Bank Corp, the country's National Social Security Fund and big state insurers, among others, as investors from previous funding rounds.

Shares of Applied Materials fell sharply Friday after the company lowered its current-quarter revenue and sales projections in its semiconductor business below Wall Street expectations. At one point, shares of the company, one of the globe's largest supplier of tools used by chipmakers, tumbled more than 9.5 percent Friday, on track for its worst day since February 2009. By early afternoon, it was down 8.2 percent. Its disappointing forecast only fueled investor anxiety that a plateauing smartphone market could finally curb demand for flash memory chips. \"Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models. And in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning,\" CEO Gary Dickerson told investors on Thursday's earnings call. show chapters Can chip stocks make a comeback? 12:02 PM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 05:37 Applied Materials said it expects semiconductor sales revenue to grow 7 percent in the current quarter, well short of the 13.8 percent boost expected by the Street, according to FactSet. As a barometer for the rest of the industry, Applied Materials' top customers include other large multinational companies like Samsung Electronics, Micron and Intel. Micron and Intel shares also fell Friday. The disappointing guidance drew critical comments from Goldman Sachs analysts, who downgraded the company's shares to neutral from buy on Friday. \"We downgrade Applied Materials from buy to neutral as we reduce our estimates and price target to reflect the underwhelming market share outlook in the core Semi Cap Equipment business, worse-than-feared fundamentals in Display, and a muted gross margin outlook,\" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote. Hari, who emphasized Goldman remains \"constructive\" on Applied Materials' competitive positioning, nonetheless cut the company's price target to $58 from $65, implying 7 percent upside over the next 12 months. Despite the lackluster guidance, Applied Materials did post second-quarter results that beat consensus expectations and offered upbeat comments looking forward for the business as a whole. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 versus expectations of $1.14, while revenue of $4.57 billion topped forecasts of $4.45 billion. \"The Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence will disrupt and transform virtually every industry and area of the economy over the next decade,\" Dickerson added in the earnings call. \"While we're only at the very beginning of the buildout of the AI big data era, we are already starting to see the positive impact on our markets.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

In an interview with CNBC in Melbourne on Friday, he said: \"As a banker, I am ashamed.\" A Royal Commission inquiry had exposed the misconduct of bankers across the sector, including NAB. The bank told the Commission it identified more than 1,300 customers who may have been affected by the misconduct of dozens of its bankers. NAB has admitted to the inquiry that some of its advisers had engaged in dishonest and illegal conduct such as misappropriation of client funds. It has paid A$19 million in compensation to customers. It also said that for years it charged advisory fees to hundreds of thousands of clients without providing them with services or allocating them an adviser. In an open letter to customers and shareholders, Thorburn said that 20 bankers in New South Wales and Victoria have had their employment terminated, or are no longer with NAB as a result of its investigation. Thorburn conceded that bad behavior has no place in a bank. \"I also know (Australian Securities and Investment Commission James Shipton) talked about focusing more on and clamping down on bad behavior. And I agree totally with that because when we have bad behavior in a bank it's really destabilizing and debilitating.\" \"We need to find it, fix it, and hold people accountable. And we will continue to do that.\" However, the NAB boss defended the majority of his bankers \u2014 there are 12,000 versus the 20 who were involved, pointing out \"there's a lot of people here who are doing absolutely the right thing.\" \u2014 Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

But Chen pointed out that some cost-cutting measures may affect margins, which in turn affects investors. The analyst said jewelry brands such as Tiffany can leverage prices to get better returns for investors. \"Grocery, food, apparel, where there's less differentiation, that becomes a problem, and people compete on price,\" the analyst said. \"And that's a big factor for retail over the long term, especially with Amazon and others,\" Chen said. \"Competing on the basis of price is very competitive.\" In fact, Tiffany's success may be in part because it is \"un-Amazonable,\" Chen said, referring to experiences that can't be bought online.

The stock fell about 2.4 percent and is now down 8 percent for 2018. The Disney-produced \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" delivered a franchise-low $83.3 million in North American ticket sales over the three-day weekend. Over four days, the movie brought in $101 million. This was about $40 million light of revenue expectations, according to B. Riley FBR analyst Barton Crockett. \"All else equal, this suggests the Star Wars movie is pacing close to breakeven, a 2% headwind for our Disney estimates,\" Crockett said in a note to clients Tuesday. Last week, revenue forecasts had been as high as $150 million for the four-day debut of \"Solo.\" The movie marked the lowest opening for a Disney-produced film in the Star Wars franchise. Until then, \"Rogue One\" had been Disney's lowest-grossing Star Wars film, bringing in $155 million in its 2016 debut. \"The Last Jedi\" brought in $220 million, while \"The Force Awakens\" brought in $248 million, according to Box Office Mojo. The company paid $4 billion in 2012 to buy the franchise from Star Wars creator LucasFilm.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A farmer unloads harvested corn in Marshall, Missouri. U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co. is set for upside as rising grain prices spur a cycle of equipment replacement across the globe, according to UBS. Analyst Steven Fisher, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, also told clients that a potential dividend increase and a strong earnings performance this summer could prove lucrative for shareholders. \"We think the slow recovery in Deere's large agricultural business could accelerate in fiscal year 2019 with higher grain prices, which have a favorable set-up entering the growing season,\" Fisher said in a note Thursday. \"We think higher grain prices would stimulate a recovery in North American high-horsepower tractors, which have been declining for five years.\" In addition to the burgeoning demand for tractor equipment, UBS believes Deere will raise its dividend 21 percent in fiscal 2018 to a 30 percent payout ratio. Assuming the company continues to return 50 percent to 60 percent of its operating cash to shareholders, Fisher said, Deere will have $1.25 billion in cash flow left over to buy back shares. The equipment maker upgraded its sales outlook earlier in the year, citing stronger conditions in its agricultural and construction markets. For the past four years, Deere has been struggling against weaker demand for farm equipment as global oversupplies kept a lid on prices. \"Given the recovery ongoing in 2018 and management's expectation that operating cash flow will grow 56 percent year over year, we think it is very likely that Deere could raise its dividend and continue to buy back shares,\" Fisher said. The expectation of shareholder-friendly activity prompted Fisher to increase his 12-month price target on Deere's stock to $185 from $175, implying 18 percent upside over the next year.

On Tuesday, the White House announced it would have a final list of $50 billion in imports that would be subject to 25 percent tariffs by June 15, and two weeks later would announce investment restrictions on Chinese acquisitions of U.S. technology. In response, China is reportedly looking to line up countries against the U.S., the Journal reported. The countries in question are mostly in Europe and Asia, where companies could benefit from China's plans to give foreign companies more open access to its markets.

As part of that deal, China would reduce its trade advantage by buying more U.S. goods such as agricultural and energy commodities.

Ahead of the planned listing, HNA is seeking to raise about $350 million by selling new shares, expanding its equity base by 22 percent, according to the document dated April 2018. That would give the 12-year-old airline a pre-IPO valuation of about $1.6 billion, based on Reuters calculations. Greg Baker | AFP | Getty Images The company also wants to raise up to $550 million via convertible bonds or tradable bonds before the listing, the document showed. The bond issue will be at a coupon rate of 8-to-10 percent for a two-to-five year period, according to the document. For comparison, Virgin Australia Holdings, a partner of Hong Kong Airlines \u2014 which also lacks an investment grade rating \u2014 this month raised A$150 million ($113 million) through a senior unsecured bond at a coupon of 8.25 percent, according to Thomson Reuters IFR. HNA referred fund raising questions to Hong Kong Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines declined to comment. HNA Group declined to comment on its relationship with HK Airlines. These latest moves, previously unreported, signal its IPO plans for Hong Kong Airlines are back on after HNA tried to take it public a few years ago, eventually abandoning those plans in 2015. That attempt failed as it was unable to satisfy questions from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the timeline provided. It did not refile its listing application. The document reviewed by Reuters did not contain the reasons behind the new push for an offering, or the investor interest HNA may be able to generate. The Chinese aviation-to-financial services firm, which struck M&A deals worth about $50 billion in 2016 and 2017, is faced with soaring debt and a Beijing crackdown on aggressive Chinese acquirers. Tyrone Siu | Reuters A floor trader checks share prices at the Hong Kong Exchange in Hong Kong. HNA, which is selling a number of assets, is undergoing a wider reorganization under which it is partnering with companies to manage some of its assets. Reuters reported last month that HNA Group is seeking to raise as much as $1.5 billion by the end of this year in an investment fund that will serve a vehicle for the group's acquisitions. Some of HNA's other recent IPO efforts have been delayed or scrapped. HNA Group's Swiss ground services and cargo handling unit, Swissport Group, deferred plans to float shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange, citing market conditions. HNA Group scrapped its planned listing of Swiss-based airline caterer Gategroup. The new capital raising plans come at a time when Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings has expressed interest in buying into Hong Kong Airlines and its unit Hong Kong Express Airways, Reuters reported last month. The document obtained by Reuters shows that Hong Kong Airlines is targeting annual revenue of HK$14.97 billion ($1.9 billion) in 2018 and a compound annual revenue growth rate of 15 percent between 2015 and 2018. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) \u2014 a measure used by hospitality companies \u2014 are estimated to have grown 11.4 percent in 2017 to about HK$4.21 billion. Estimates for 2018's earnings were not provided in the document. Hong Kong Airlines is a carrier that operates 38 aircraft and flies to 40 cities in the Asia Pacific, Australia and North America. Its asset base is estimated to have grown 65 percent to HK$12.97 billion by 2017 from net assets of HK$7.84 billion in 2016, according to the document. Cathay Pacific Airways, another Hong Kong-based carrier, had annual revenue of HK$97.3 billion in 2017 and has a market value of $6.4 billion.

Geopolitical turmoil and policy certainty are combining to make businesses more cautious about investing, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Thursday. With nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea breaking down, the central bank leader said the development was \"a surprise\" and part of \"downside risks\" for the economy. \"Uncertainty has its own contribution,\" Bostic told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas, where Fed officials were attending a conference on disruption and technology. \"Then we actually have to ... figure out what the policy ends up being. If the policy turns out in certain ways, then business can go forward.\" Markets reacted negatively to the morning news, with the Dow industrials down about 200 points and government bond yields down substantially as well. In a letter to Kim Jung Un, Trump said that recent rhetoric from North Korea made a summit impossible at this point. Trump also announced possible new tariffs on imported vehicles to the U.S. even as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier this week said a trade war with China had been averted at least for the moment. \"You're at the fork in the road, and there are multiple ways you can go,\" Bostic said. \"What I'm hearing from business is we're going to wait and we're going to see what happens, and I think that will offset some of the impact.\" On other matters, Bostic said he thinks the Fed is getting close to the end of its rate-hiking cycle. The so-called neutral rate, he said, is probably around 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent, which would imply three to five more increases in the Fed's benchmark funds rate. The comments came a day after the Federal Open Market Committee, of which Bostic is a voting member, released minutes from a meeting earlier this month that indicated officials are comfortable with letting inflation run a little hot for a short period as the economy grows. \"For me, I think we get to the neutral and we let the economy work,\" Bostic said. Correction: Bostic's Fed affiliation was misstated in an earlier version.

The drugmaker announced the review earlier this year, but Brent Saunders, its chief executive, has said he was opposed to fundamental changes to its business strategy. Still, the review considered options such as splitting up the company, selling assets, making acquisitions and using capital to buy back shares. Saunders is scheduled to make a presentation at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions investor conference in New York on Wednesday morning. Allergan, the maker of Botox, is trying to right itself after a difficult year. Its shares are down 32 percent over the last 12 months and fell nearly 2 percent in trading on Tuesday. They dropped more than 1 percent in early trading Wednesday. The sale of the units would allow Allergan to refocus on four key areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastrointestinal. Proceeds from the sales could be used to pay down debt and buy back shares. A recent note from Cowen analysts valued the women's health business at $4 billion and the infectious disease business at $2 billion.

Many companies are trying to create a digital payments economy, but they face stiff competition from regular currencies, according to Sri Shivananda, senior vice president and chief technology officer at PayPal. \"The competition is cash,\" Shivananda told CNBC in an interview last month. \"It's not even, like, you're fighting for each other's volumes. It's actually cash.\" Last year, a study from consulting firm Capgemini and bank BNP Paribas predicted that by 2020, people around the world would make about 726 billion transactions using digital payment technology. The study found that emerging markets are expected to drive the upward trend. Developments in new technologies such as contactless bank cards, wearable devices and augmented reality will drive cashless transactions in the future, according to the study. Still, it acknowledged that cash remained the main method of payment among users. In fact, other research findings and surveys have demonstrated that many around the world still prefer to use cash. Cash is king Last August, a PayPal study found cash was still king in Asia, with China being an outlier where majority of the respondents said they preferred using digital payments. The European Central Bank said in November that a majority of people in the Euro area used cash when paying for goods and services in 2016 \u2014 especially for small-value items below 15 euros ($17.62). Still, in recent years, new forms of online payments have emerged, including mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies. show chapters Our merchants not interested in crypto\u2014it's too volatile: PayPal CFO 7:17 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 01:06 But the move away from cash will take time and it would be the \"digital natives\" \u2014 people born after 1980 \u2014 who would lead the change, according to Shivananda. \"Their primary mode of interaction with everything in the world is digital,\" he said. Even then, it would not be easy to dislodge cash from society and move solely to digital payments, according to David Ng, a principal at investment firm B Capital Group's Singapore office. \"Cash is going to be around for a bit, especially in many emerging markets,\" Ng told CNBC. He explained that in many countries, it's not easy to obtain credit or debit cards, or use digital payment platforms. But a systematic push from governments and the availability of good digital payment platforms, like WeChat Pay and M-Pesa, might drive more people toward cashless transactions, he said. Even then, \"consumers will still choose a hybrid of both,\" he added. Convincing consumers to switch There are three things that payments companies must do to convince people to make the jump from using cash to digital payments, according to Shivananda. \"Security is definitely number one,\" he said. \"Privacy is number two and reliability is number three.\" With cash, most transactions happen directly between a buyer and a seller and, therefore, is usually both secure and private. But with digital payments, users would want to know that, not only is their money secure, but the way they spend is also kept private, Shivananda explained. That becomes a fine line which digital payments companies have to tread, because one benefit of digital payments include the ability for businesses to collect data that can give them insights into customer behavior. Being a reliable payments service is therefore a competitive advantage for companies, said the experts. \"It is often hard for consumers and merchants to distinguish who has a better technology,\" B Capital's Ng said. \"But they will make their judgment based on ease of use, performance and network.\" Protecting users' trust Fraudulent online transactions, data breach and privacy issues would likely erode user trust in digital payments and other financial technology \u2014 or fintech \u2014 services, according to experts. Scott Galit, CEO of Payoneer, a payments processing company based in New York, added that some fintech companies today underestimate issues surrounding regulation, risk and compliance. That may potentially increase the risk of events, such as a cyber attack, where consumer trust is destroyed because a start-up did not follow anti-money laundering procedures, according to Galit. \"Overall, I think there's too much tech, not enough fin,\" he said, adding, \"Most of the people that get into this don't come from the financial services side. They come at it with a 'oh, I can be a disruptor' [and] use technology to do some cool stuff.\" WATCH: PayPal CFO on mobile opportunity show chapters PayPal CFO sees opportunity in consumers who have mobile devices, but not bank accounts 1:23 PM ET Thu, 17 May 2018 | 09:06 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/21/105220540-GettyImages-860933814.jpg?v=1526892859", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Matt Cardy"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images Cash"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Sri Shivananda"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Shivananda"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last month"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Last year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Capgemini"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BNP Paribas"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2020"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 726 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Last August"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "PayPal"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Asia"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "China"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The European Central Bank"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "November"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Euro area"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2016"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "15"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "17.62"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "recent years"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "PayPal CFO 7:17 PM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "16"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1980"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Shivananda"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "David Ng"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "B Capital Group's"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Singapore"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "WeChat Pay"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Shivananda"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Privacy"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "number two"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "number three"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Shivananda"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Scott Galit"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Payoneer"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "today"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Galit"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "PayPal CFO"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "1:23 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "17"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "There are three things that payments companies must do to convince people to make the jump from using cash to digital payments, according to Sri Shivananda, senior vice president and chief technology officer at PayPal.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/cash-is-still-the-biggest-threat-for-digital-payments-firms-paypal-cto.html", "author": "Matt Cardy | Getty Images", "title": "Cash is still king even as digital payments are set to rise, says PayPal CTO"}, {"time": "2018-05-22T08:13:38-0400", "body": " show chapters Yield curve points to challenges for US economy, warns investor 8:13 AM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 03:51 The bond market is signaling an upcoming correction and investors should sell their shares in listed companies, a strategist told CNBC Tuesday. Borrowing costs have gone up over the last few weeks, with the yield on both the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and the two-year bond reaching multiyear highs last Friday. Higher yields, which move inversely to bond prices, pose a risk for equity markets, given that they mean higher costs for companies and, thus, fewer chances for shareholders to make profits. At the same time, the difference between long and short-term borrowing costs keeps narrowing, in what investors describe as a flattening of the yield curve. This indicates that investors see debt that is to be repaid in two years being nearly as risky as lending it for 10 years. In a normal, functioning economy, lending in the short term has fewer risks \u2014 the underlying thought is that you can more easily predict what's happening tomorrow rather next month. \"Yields are going up and the yield curve is flattening, you very rarely get good outcomes from this,\" Michael Howell, chief executive officer at Border Capital, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Tuesday. \"I am dancing closer to the fire exit than I have been for some time.\" -Neil Dwane, Global strategist at Allianz Global Investors He added that those fully invested in equities should be \"very worried.\" Apart from the uptick in yields, there is a group of factors posing the seeds for a potential correction. These are: higher risk appetite, reduced capital flows and a continued monetary policy tightening from central banks, Howell said in a note. Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S. The most influential central banks across the world are set to slowly end the era of cheap money, by increasing borrowing costs. Ultimately, this could exacerbate the problem of higher yields even more. Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC that the markets haven't fully understood that central bank policy is changing. \"We are concerned the market is understating the impact of quantitative tightening, particularly in the U.S.,\" he said, adding, \"I am dancing closer to the fire exit than I have been for some time.\" Amid expectations of a storm in equity markets and higher short-term yields, Howell suggested investors should exit the equity market. \"Take your money off the table,\" he said, adding that investors should then only put that money back after a correction has taken place.

It would be a great pity if the occasion were missed because \u2014 as some foreign leaders argue \u2014 Trump was too absorbed by watershed Congressional elections in early November. There is no doubt that the president realizes how much the world affairs are inextricably part of key events that will determine the fate of his time in office next fall. Wall Street is reminding him of that every day with asset price changes in the wake of tax cuts, jobs and income gains and hopes of stopping America's decades-old losses of material wealth and cutting-edge intellectual property to unfair and predatory foreign trade practices. It is urgent to begin showing some progress on those issues. Not by one-liner tweets, but with a clearly stated call for action on America's vitally important national interests. That should be a comfortable exercise. America's trade case is solid. In the opposite corner are people posing as defenders of multilateralism and free trade who are, in fact, responsible for excessive trade surpluses at the expense of the U.S. and the rest of the world. Here is a thought on how that could go. The combined surplus of China and Germany on current transactions with the rest of the world came in last year at $463.4 billion. During the same period, the U.S. trade deficit on the equivalent external account was $466.2 billion. If those three countries \u2014 representing nearly 40 percent of global demand and output \u2014 were taken as a proxy for the world economy, you would have a perfect textbook case to show that the balance of payments of the world is zero, exactly as it should be, with minor measurement errors. What that also shows is that the Chinese and German trade surpluses would be enough to finance American deficits through purchases of U.S. government debt instruments. In other words, the Chinese and the Germans would be adding to their net foreign assets by recycling the dollars America paid them for their goods and services. America, of course, is left holding the bag: It is accumulating net foreign debt. At the end of last year, that debt was recently estimated to have stood at $7.8 trillion. Big deal? Of course it is, on several counts. First, large and systematic trade deficits indicate an economic policy that excessively relies on external demand to generate income and employment. These are export-driven growth strategies also known under a less flattering name of \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policies, because the countries pursuing such objectives live off their trade partners. Second, those countries are in violation of the long-established rules of trade adjustment. They are also flouting constant G-20 recommendations to balance trade accounts for a stable world economy. Third, these two major surplus countries are doing nothing in response to U.S. trade complaints over the last year-and-a-half. In the first quarter of this year, the combined trade surpluses of China and the Germany-led European Union accounted for 62.4 percent of America's total trade gap. That is almost identical to 65 percent for last year as a whole. With all that, the trade miscreants, and their apologists, continue to vilify the U.S. as a protectionist destroying the rules-based multinational trading system \u2014 simply because Washington sought relief from soaring debts and deficits, with losses of jobs, incomes and intellectual property. And that outrageous perversion continues. As recently as last Friday, the International Monetary Fund, the U.N.'s key economic and financial agency, warned at an international business meeting in Russia about \"the darkest cloud\" over the world economy caused by the \"determination of some (read: the U.S.) to actually rock the system that has actually presided over the trade relationships that we have all undertaken and enjoyed to some extent over the last many decades.\" Enjoyed, indeed \u2014 at America's expense. That's what Trump is told by a U.N. agency whose original charter calls for a symmetrical obligation of deficit and surplus countries to balance their trade accounts in order to make possible a system of stable exchange rates in a steadily growing world economy. Essentially, that is still the IMF's mission. Washington should take a note of that, and stop whining that balancing America's trade accounts will be very difficult. That defeatist stand sounds like the countries that, in Trump's vernacular, are \"ripping us off\" should be doing the country a favor by buying more American goods and services. This is no time for a trade discourse via tweets and occasional off-the-cuff broadsides. The G-7 meeting next week is a stage to demand a rapid reduction of America's excessive trade deficits. Trump should also know that his trade opponents are regrouping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel completed last week her 11th visit to Beijing, where, apparently, she secured substantial alternatives to German export sales on American markets. German media are reporting that she even explored a free-trade agreement with China \u2014 a total reversal of recent threats and accusations she leveled at Beijing's discriminatory trade and investment practices, and the Chinese meddling in Germany's Central and East European backyards. That's called realpolitik, and it came with kudos from German media for showing Trump how things are done. Investment thoughts With the Federal Reserve poised for interest rate increases in response to rising inflation and a strengthening economy, markets are increasingly sensitive to trade frictions and military confrontations. The U.S. should calm things down by making sure that China and the EU accept \u2014 without the usual equivocations \u2014 to fully cooperate in a rapid balancing out of trade accounts with America. Overseas tensions with proxy wars and debilitating sanctions is another source of problems depressing U.S. asset prices \u2014 in spite of a favorable market environment created by supportive fiscal policies and the Fed's measured pace of liquidity withdrawals. Unless Trump can reduce trade frictions and geopolitical confrontations in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and East Asia, he should not count on another tax cut to rev up financial markets in anticipation of next November's elections.

That's 3.3 percent more than the year-earlier period as strong equities trading results offset declines in bond trading and investment banking, the firm said Thursday. show chapters Banks race to incorporate artificial intelligence 7:41 AM ET Fri, 25 May 2018 | 04:00 But the industry still eliminated 6,000 employees in the quarter, falling to 52,100 front-office jobs such as trading, sales and advisory. That's 13 percent fewer employees than in 2013. Europe struggling Nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the industry is still in contraction mode as a handful of U.S.-based winners \u2014 think J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 take market share from beleaguered European rivals. German lender Deutsche Bank said Thursday it will eliminate 7,000 jobs, including a quarter of its equities trading personnel. Also hurting headcount is the continued migration of stock and bond trading to electronic platforms and away from human-to-human interaction. European firms bore the brunt of the recent job cuts, according to Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition. That's because American banks benefited disproportionately from the first quarter's 28 percent bump in overall stock trading revenue, he said. \"Most of the uptick is going to the American banks, with one or two exceptions,'' Shahani said. \"The gap between the Americans and Europeans has widened.'' The five biggest U.S. banks claimed 62 percent of global revenues, while seven European firms shared the rest, according to Coalition's data. That gap was the widest since at least 2012, showing that European firms have been steadily losing ground.

U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp has agreed to buy smaller rival MB Financial in a stock-and-cash deal valued at about $4.7 billion as it looks to expand in Chicago and broaden its middle market customer base. A windfall from last year's Republican tax overhaul has encouraged more investment among mid-sized U.S. lenders and banks are also hopeful that legislative moves to roll back some rules on capital requirements will free up more cash. That runs contrary to the several years of minimal merger activity in the sector due to stricter rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis which effectively put limits on expansion. As part of the deal announced on Monday, each MB Financial shareholder will get $54.20, comprising 1.45 shares of Fifth Third common stock and $5.54 in cash, a 24 percent premium to MB Financial's last close. The merger with Chicago-based MB Financial will result in the combined entity having a total Chicago deposit market share of 6.5 percent, ranking it fourth in total deposits among the nearly 200 banks in the marketplace, Fifth Third said. Fifth Third Bank, which operates 1,300 branches and 2,600 ATMs across 12 states, said the deal is expected to reduce its regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 45 basis points. Fifth Third also said once the deal closes, two members of MB Financial's board of directors were expected to join the Fifth Third Bancorp board. Citi served as financial adviser to Fifth Third, while Sandler ONeill + Partners advised MB Financial.

It's a mixed bag \u2013 a green energy developer, a shoemaker, a telecom equipment manufacturer and a port on the border with North Korea. But the businesses all have one thing in common: they're among a rash of bond defaulters that has players wondering whether a day of debt reckoning in China's US$2.8 trillion onshore corporate bond market is finally dawning. At least 20 corporate bond defaults have occurred in China so far this year, with the latest coming on Monday from CEFC Shanghai, the troubled Shanghai-based energy conglomerate controlled by tycoon Ye Jianming. More from the South China Morning Post: CEFC defaults on 2 billion yuan of bonds as fallen oligarch's asset-buying firm goes rudderless China's private firms default on US$2 billion bond repayments as Beijing's deleveraging efforts bite How Trump's obsession with China could turn America into Japan China had 15 corporate bond defaults in the first four months of this year, involving a combined 12.9 billion yuan (US$2 billion), or a third more in value than the same time last year, according to China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing, the official source for bond data. The defaults continued in May. While the amounts are a drop in the bucket of the overall industry, analysts said defaults were set to grow this year and beyond as China's central bank tightened up on monetary policy. Observers said the tightening would make it more expensive and harder for Chinese corporate borrowers to get funds from investors. There are signs that this could already be happening. On Monday, Shenzhen-listed gardening firm Beijing Orient Landscape and Environment said in its exchange filing that it had planned to raise 1 billion yuan by selling bonds with an annual coupon of 7 per cent but it only managed to raise 50 million yuan from investors. Christopher Lee, managing director of S&P's corporate rating department in Hong Kong, said corporate defaults in China were set to grow and spread from private businesses to state firms. \"[China's] deleveraging campaign is affecting the liquidity [of borrowers who] relied on shadow banking channels for funding,\" Lee said. With control of financial risks a top national priority, the People's Bank of China is putting the squeeze on shadow banking, ending a decade of financial exuberance where debts could be easily rolled over and defaults were rare. Vice-Premier Liu He, one of President Xi Jinping's top economic aides, told a gathering of political advisers last week that wrongdoings must be corrected. \"You can't borrow all the money for your business. Debt must be repaid, investors must shoulder risks and wrongdoers must pay a price,\" he was quoted by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying. Most of the 21 defaulters so far this year have been private businesses but there have been signs of debt stress in the publicly traded sector, too. Tianjin Real Estate, a property developer backed by the municipality of Tianjin, was set to miss a 200 million yuan repayment to a trust investment plan due on May 18, with the trust product's manager, China Citic Trust, issuing a warning to investors on May 10. The developer came through with the cash at the last minute but it still has a debt mountain of over 180 billion yuan. Li Yang, director general of the National Institution of Finance and Development, a state-backed think tank, said that investors were reluctant to buy corporate bonds because the coupons were \"inadequate to cover risks\". Li, a former adviser to the central bank, said Beijing was now determined to deleverage. \"The previous logic was that we must drive up GDP growth in times [of financial stress],\" he said. \"Now the central government has great determination [to reduce financial risks at the cost of short-term growth].\" Peng Xingyun, a senior monetary policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the central bank might follow the US Federal Reserve in raising market rates, a change that would make it even harder for borrowers to honour their debts. \"The US Fed rates have become an anchor since Beijing made the yuan exchange rate a higher priority,\" Peng said. But Brokerage house China Everbright Securities argued in a note on Tuesday that the ongoing bond defaults in China were caused by regulation more than economic fundamentals. \"This wave of defaults is a result of credit crunch caused by enhanced regulation,\" China Everbright said. \"The wave will retreat in about a quarter.\" Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

About 110,000 students applied for Deutsche Bank's graduate scheme this year in the most striking example of millennials' appetite for careers at even the most troubled banks. The applications for Deutsche, which recently announced 7,000 job cuts to drop its workforce to less than 90,000, were up 20 per cent in a year when rivals including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup also saw significant increases in applications, data gathered by the Financial Times shows. Several other large investment banks would not reveal application numbers but said they had increased graduate hires. UBS said it increased its UK hires by almost 50 per cent, to 100, despite the uncertain climate created by Brexit. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. Graduate hiring has been a vexed topic since the financial crisis, with banking steadily falling in popularity among the Ivy League and Oxbridge pools from which banks traditionally filled their benches. Brexit was expected to blunt London hiring. \"We had all of the top universities pre-crisis \u2026 now [our demand] is more varied. We're going broader in terms of the places where we source from,\" said Manolo Falco, Citi's head of Emea corporate and investment banking. Citi drew 60,761 applications for its corporate and investment banking programmes globally, up 12 per cent year on year. The candidates were vying for 520 jobs, which was down from the 575 offered a year earlier. Figures for Citi's markets division are not available. Deutsche's candidates were applying for jobs across the bank, according to a person with knowledge of the bank's hiring. The person said that Deutsche had hired 619 graduates globally last year, and that \"we expect that to increase this year too\". Deutsche has spent much of the last year mired in crisis, culminating in the chaotic replacement of its chief executive in April and the announcement of another round of cuts that will largely fall on the investment bank, a popular destination for graduates. Its investment bank has been one of the most progressive in its graduate hiring techniques, using groundbreaking AI assessment tools to screen a broad pool of talent for those who are the best emotional and cognitive fit for the bank. Morgan Stanley attracted about 100,000 applications for about 1,000 places on its summer analyst programme for undergraduates and its summer associates programme for MBA students. The bank said applications were up 8 per cent year on year. Barclays International will hire about 500 graduates this year, up from 450 in 2017. \"We continue to see high levels of interest in our programmes globally, including from students early in their university careers,\" said Margaret Capote, head of Barclays' International Graduate Resourcing and Development, adding that the bank had expanded its spring programmes in both the UK and the US. UBS would not give details of its application levels but said it had hired about 400 graduates so far this year, including about 100 in the UK. Last year, UBS hired about 400 graduates globally, of which 70 were in the UK. Citi's Mr. Falco said that banks' efforts to promote work-life balance had \"definitely had an impact\" on application levels, but the jobs were still very demanding. \"You can't hide it; banking is a hard-working kind of industry \u2026 Even with all of what we've done, it's high intensity over long hours.\" Banks have rolled out measures including mandatory weekends off and flexible working arrangements to make life as a junior banker less gruelling and more attractive to talented graduates weighing offers from other sectors. Citi looked at whether the intensity and hours could be reduced by simply hiring more graduates but concluded that it would not work, Falco said. \"When a client has a problem, the solution has to be the next morning, having more people wouldn't obviously fix that, the client wants specific [directors or managing directors] and those people want people around them they can trust.\" More from the Financial Times: Britain's foreign policy lacks vision for its post-Brexit future The world's progress brings new challenges Oil lower again as market mulls supply pressure ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/29/105237249-GettyImages-951434652.jpg?v=1533306421", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Krisztian Bocsi"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bloomberg"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Getty Images"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche Bank AG"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Frankfurt"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Germany"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "About 110,000"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche Bank's"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "7,000"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "less than 90,000"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20 per cent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Morgan Stanley"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Citigroup"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Financial Times"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "UBS"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "UK"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "almost 50 per cent"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "100"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Brexit"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "4 weeks"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Financial Times"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "just $1"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Oxbridge"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "London"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Manolo Falco"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Citi"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "60,761"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "12"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "520"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "575"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "a year earlier"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Citi"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "619"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Deutsche"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "April"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "AI"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Morgan Stanley"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 100,000"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 1,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "summer"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "summer"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "8 per cent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Barclays International"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 500"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "450"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Margaret Capote"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Barclays' International Graduate Resourcing and Development"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "spring"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "UK"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "US"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "UBS"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 400"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 100"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "UK"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Last year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "UBS"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "about 400"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "70"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "UK"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Citi"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Falco"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "long hours"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Falco"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "the next morning"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Financial Times"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Britain"}], "description": "Even after banking climate post-Brexit has left some concerned; Deutsche bank, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup has seen significant increase in graduate applications for temporary work, the Financial Times reports.

The industrial conglomerate is down about 47 percent from 12 months ago. It also cut its dividend in half in November. \"It's got a great mix of a whole bunch of portfolio companies,\" said Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers' Retirement System. GE is part of CalSTRS' portfolio, which had $224.7 billion in total investment assets as of April 30. On Wednesday, GE dropped the most in a single day of trading since April 2009 after CEO John Flannery said the company will \"have to see how\" the turnaround plan \"plays out\" before deciding whether to cut the company's dividend again. However, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday that GE does not plan to cut its dividend in 2019. Flannery's remarks may have been misinterpreted, according to those sources. Ailman told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday that while GE has been one of the laggards in the Dow Jones industrial average, the future looks optimistic. \"We think it's going to improve in value over time,\" he said. \"The dividend is important but it is not critical. It is more important for the pensioners but for us as a shareholder, we're interested in the total return of the stock.\" Meanwhile, he thinks Flannery, who took the helm of the beleaguered company in August, is off to a good start. \"He needs to continue to diversify the board. We'd like to see more outside ideas come into that board because there's such a diverse set of product mix,\" said Ailman. \"One of the challenges for Wall Street is trying to figure out what exactly GE is.\" However, he anticipates a trying time ahead for the new CEO.

The US's banks have largely sat out the mergers and acquisitions wave of recent years. While deal records have fallen in almost every other sector, big banks have done almost nothing, shrinking rather than expanding. And merger activity among small and mid-sized banks \u2014 some 5,607 of them, at last count \u2014 has been subdued. But when Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati revealed its $4.7bn swoop for Chicago's MB Financial on Monday morning, shares in other Chicago-area banks began to move, too. Wintrust, a similar-sized bank based in Rosemont, Illinois, ended the day up almost 4 per cent, while First Midwest of Itasca closed up 3 per cent. The implications were obvious: after years of thin activity in bank M&A, this deal could mark a turn. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The conditions for dealmaking look better than at any time since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates and lower taxes have pumped up bank profits, giving management teams stronger platforms from which to contemplate doing something radical. Data released on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that net income across the banking industry rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter, to a record $56bn. Shareholder activists have also begun to flex their muscles, calling for fresh ways to boost returns at Ally Financial, Comerica, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Regions Financial, among others. And then \u2014 most importantly \u2014 there is the shifting regulatory landscape. For much of the post-crisis period, agencies generally frowned on any transaction that might make a bank bigger, more complex and tougher to police. Several proposed combinations were abandoned because regulators took too long to approve them, among them New York Community Bancorp's bid for Astoria Financial and Investors Bancorp's move on The Bank of Princeton. A $5.3bn tie-up between M&T Bank of New York and Hudson City Bancorp of New Jersey took more than three years to limp over the finish line. Now, under the administration of Donald Trump, there are clear signs that attitude is changing. Last year, the Federal Reserve made it easier for banks to merge by lifting the combined size threshold that would trigger a much deeper regulatory probe, from $25bn in assets to $100bn. On top of that, the Fed is considering a change to the way it grades banks' management teams, moving from a five-point to a four-point scale. In practice, said Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell, that may mean many managers will be bumped up from a grade 3 (\"less than satisfactory\") to a grade 2 (\"satisfactory\"). In the past, a three-rating has been an effective bar on doing deals, keeping many would-be acquirers on the sidelines. Another spur to consolidation comes with the new bank-relief bill passed on Tuesday by Congress, which is set to free small and mid-sized lenders from many of the restraints that apply to the trillion-dollar banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. What does the new bank-relief law change? Financial stability regulation: Raises the size threshold at which the strictest supervision kicks in from $50bn in assets to $250bn. Volcker rule and bank capital requirements: Exempts small banks with assets of under $10bn from the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading. Mortgage lending rules: Makes it easier for small banks to offer mortgages by increasing legal protection and reducing data requirements. The most obvious \"winners\" are regional banks in the $50bn-in-assets to $100bn bracket, said Quyen Truong, a Washington-based partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. She noted that such banks now find themselves freed from all of the Fed's \"enhanced prudential standards\" \u2014 tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test. Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets will still face periodic stress tests, but will be exempted from other tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill's enactment. All of which suggests that more bank acquisitions are likely. \"I think we are at a potential real tipping point,\" said Mr Cohen. \"You've got positive incentives to do deals, and the removal of obstacles to do deals.\" The one caveat, for now, is the valuations of bank stocks. Shares in Fifth Third slumped the most in almost two years on Monday, down 8 per cent, after investors turned their nose up at the MB deal. In particular, they criticised the meagre 2 per cent boost to earnings per share next year \u2014 even with some very aggressive assumptions on cost-cutting \u2014 and the projection it will take seven years to overcome the hit to tangible book value, which is much longer than the three to five years that is normal for bank acquisitions, according to M&A bankers. Chris Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique, said Fifth Third may have been bounced into a deal, following rumours of interest in MB from other potential acquirers last week. Two of the banks linked to MB, US Bancorp and Bank of Montreal, declined to comment. Fifth Third's share price slide was \"clearly a wake-up call\" for other potential acquirers, said Mr Marinac. \"You've got to have your transaction buttoned up and with a quicker payback period.\" If dealmaking does begin to pick up, investors may ultimately look more kindly on banks that move early rather than miss out on potential partners. On Tuesday, Fifth Third's stock recovered some of the lost ground, closing up 3 per cent.

Carl Icahn is joining his protege Keith Meister in a deal that may ultimately lead to their purchase of oil and gas producer Energen Corp. Meister founded his own firm, Corvex Management, in 2010 after years learning the activist trade at Icahn Enterprises, where he was vice chairman of the board and principal executive officer. Any deal for Energen could also affect activist Paul Singer's Elliott Management, which took a stake in the company last year and sided with Corvex in pushing for a sale. Corvex has spent more than a year pressuring Energen to seek a buyer, saying the company had valuable assets in the prolific drilling terrain known as the Permian Basin but that its shares were undervalued. Earlier this year, it nominated four candidates to Energen's board to ratchet up the pressure. The two sides came to an agreement in March, when Energen agreed to appoint two board members and begin a strategic review of its business. show chapters When you're lucky you can't always confuse it with being smart: Carl Icahn 2:28 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 06:34 One of those new board members was Vincent Intrieri, a former senior managing director at Icahn Capital Management who retired from that firm last year. He served on the boards of several companies on behalf of Icahn during his time there, including Hertz Global Holdings and Transocean, where he still sits, and Chesapeake Energy, where he sat from 2012 to 2016. He joined Energen's board in March. But the story is not ending there. On Monday, Corvex said in an amended securities ownership filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a deal to sell 2 million shares of its stake to Icahn and the option for him to buy 2 million more. In total, Icahn would end up with about 4.1 percent, the filing said. Following the transaction, Corvex will have 8.46 million Energen shares, or about 8.7 percent, about even with fellow top shareholder Vanguard Group, but smaller than the nearly 10 percent it previously held, according to FactSet. In March, Energen said its board had begun an in-depth review of its strategic options, getting advice from J. P. Morgan and Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co. Corvex said in the filing on Monday that it believes the company's shares are undervalued and that it may \"have an interest in joining with other parties to acquire the issuer as part of the strategic initiatives process or otherwise.\"' Last year, Singer's Elliott Management joined Corvex in pushing Energen to sell. It holds about 3 percent of Energen's shares, according to FactSet. Elliott said in March it supported Energen's decision to review strategic alternatives. \"We expect that any such review, to be considered truly comprehensive, will be conducted with shareholder input and will include full engagement with interested acquirers,\" it said. A spokesman said Elliott wasn't commenting on Monday's news. On CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Monday, Icahn said he hadn't talked to Singer about the deal. Icahn also said he believed Energen was worth possibly $100 a share and that it might be an attractive purchase for a major energy company, particularly a pipeline operator. The additional pressure from him and Meister seems to be aimed at pushing the strategic review along more quickly. \"We have a lot of cash around. We could buy this company,\" he said, with or without help from others. \"However, I don't presume to feel I'm the right buyer for it because there are such synergies for another company.\" But, Icahn added, Energen's board \"agreed to do a process on March 7 and nobody's heard about that process yet.\" Shares of Energen are up 6 percent in Monday trading. When Energen announced its settlement Corvex, Meister released a statement saying, \"We are pleased to have worked constructively and to have reached a resolution that will bolster the Board with new highly qualified directors as we pursue our common goal of enhancing shareholder value.\" A spokesman said Energen declined to comment.

Enthusiasm around the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, remains strong despite warnings from investors such as Warren Buffett that they're worthless. That mania and attempts to launch new units of money have existed in different forms since the 1800s, Shiller said. Shiller, best known for warning about the housing and dot-com bubbles, pointed to the early 19th century, when merchants tried to replace the gold standard with \"time money.\" The \"Cincinnati Time Store\" for example sold merchandise in units of work and closed just three years after it launched. One hundred years later during the Great Depression, economist John Pease Norton proposed a dollar by electricity, which also failed to catch on. show chapters Bitcoin craze is more psychological than economic: Nobel laureate 10:10 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:56 \"Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story,\" Shiller wrote in a blog post Monday. \"But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\" Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no different, he said. They were introduced by a community of entrepreneurs who, as Shiller put it, \"hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\" The mania around bitcoin today is also due in part to its mystery, the Yale University professor said. \"Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,\" Shiller said. \"None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\" The height of the public's fascination was also undoubtedly tied to bitcoin's meteoric rise in price. The world's first cryptocurrency rose to near $20,000 last year before losing roughly half of its value in the first quarter of 2018. Here is the full post by Shiller.

Heitkamp: Bank reform bill puts community banks back in the mortgage lending business 8:05 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 02:07 Small and regional banks are the big beneficiaries of the House-approved bank regulatory relief bill making its way to President Donald Trump's desk for signature this week. The bill, which passed the House on Tuesday evening by about 100 votes, cuts dozens of large regional lenders off the list of banks considered too big to fail and frees all but the biggest banks from required annual stress testing by regulators. It is seen as a victory for the banking industry, which has been pushing back at the restrictions since the financial-crisis era Dodd-Frank rules were enacted in 2010. \"I see this as allowing banks to be banks again,\" said Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James. Immediately, banks with assets that fall below $100 billion, such as Dallas-based Comerica, Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp and San Francisco's First Republic, lose the systemically important designation and won't have to submit to stress tests by the Federal Reserve or adhere to higher capital requirements. The previous threshold was $50 billion. The Fed reserves the discretion to enforce higher standards on banks above that threshold. In 18 months, when that threshold is raised to $250 billion, major regional lenders such as BB&T, SunTrust and FifthThird, will also fall off the too-big-to-fail list. The number of banks that remain on the list, facing the harshest restrictions, drops to 12 from 38 under the new rules. Those big banks still deemed systemically important include J. P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. The market has anticipated the moves. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking index (KRX) is up 8 percent this year, and the bigger-bank index, the KBW Bank index, is up 3 percent. \"For the first time in nearly a decade, lawmakers from both parties have chosen to right-size financial rules that were not working as intended and holding the economy back,\" Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement. Raymond James' Mills said the effect of the bill could be more lending by smaller banks, which have been wary of adding assets that would put them over the old Dodd-Frank thresholds. \"We will see more risk-taking,\" he said, such as a possible increase in bank lending to construction companies. Banks may take back some of the lending that has been getting done by nondeposit-taking firms, such as real estate investment trusts, he added. The bill also exempts banks with less than $10 billion of assets from restrictions on trading for themselves, a controversial provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. But it does leave other Republican bugaboos in place, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Democrats had pledged to abandon the bill if it cut that agency out, even though the administration has worked to weaken its powers. The Senate passed the bill in March. Tuesday night's vote in the House was 258 to 159, opposed by one Republican and 158 Democrats. It is the first significant change to Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in response to the financial crisis, when big banks were cast as the villains that nearly brought down the U.S. financial system. The bill, which Trump has said he will sign, also hands small banks a victory by loosening the rules on how much mortgage lending data they have to report under federal anti-discrimination laws. It is expected to be just the first wave of regulatory relief, though the dynamic may change depending on the outcome of midterm elections that could upend the balance of the currently GOP-controlled Senate and House.

According to Bianco Research President James Bianco, most economists mistakenly believe that leading indicators are signaling an \"A+\" economy that can withstand rising interest rates. \"It's more like a B- economy,\" he told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Friday. \"It's not this screaming home run that everybody thinks it is based on the survey data.\" Bianco said social media is creating the bandwagon effect among survey respondents, a psychological phenomenon characterized by people following the herd. \"The advent of social media is allowing us basically to be inundated with financial news or economic news,\" he said, adding the bulk of the news about the world's largest economy has been largely favorable. \"When somebody is asked 'what do you think about the economy,'' they are not answering 'what do you think about the economy,' Bianco said. \"They are answering 'What have you read about the economy?'\" Bianco fears the Fed will make a policy error based on respondents' answers. \"Economists like at the Fed say 'Wow, look at that data. It's even better than we thought. We have to raise rates even faster,'\" he said, adding that the tightening could derail the bull market. \"The 10-Year [yield] could very well be at 3 percent by the end of next year with a 3 percent funds rate,\" Bianco said. \"[That's when] you get an inverted yield curve.\" He suggested Fed officials should evolve and begin looking at other types of data. A solution would be favoring Google Trends, according to Bianco. His research suggests it's a far more accurate predictor of how the economy is faring. \"We bare our souls to Google,\" Bianco said. \"If we lose our job, we type in 'I lost my job.'

While it hasn't been exactly rosy for the company \u2014 with sales weighed down by challenges so far, and a slow entry into e-commerce, Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners, believes that things are looking up. \"There's just a myriad of opportunities here to generate value,\" Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners told CNBC. His firm owns 3.4 percent of the company's outstanding shares. \"More importantly, we see a business, over the next year or two, that could rapidly turn around produce profits of a dollar or maybe even $2 per share, again roughly on just under $3 per share base here,\" Miller said on \"Closing Bell\" Wednesday. Destination Maternity has a market cap of just $43 million, while stock prices have declined 75 percent over three years, or 90 percent since 2011. \"I think that points to the value destruction that's gone on by the past management and the past board of this company,\" Miller said. Management changes, reduced mall traffic and changes in the retail industry have all contributed to the company's diminished sales. The maternity apparel company has also been slow to enter the e-commerce market, manage its inventory and sales, general and administrative expenses have been \"exceptionally high,\" Miller said. \"The biggest thing that went awry was just their strategy on cost-control,\" Miller said. Destination Maternity would not respond to a request for comment. But Miller said the company's \"online piece is growing very rapidly right now. We see opportunity for them to consolidate three brands.\" The company, which is parent to A Pea in the Pod and Motherhood Maternity, made headlines Wednesday over a proxy battle to determine whether prior board experience should preclude women from obtaining future board seats. In the company's 25-year history there have been only three female directors. Shareholders, including Gullane Capital Partners, voted in favor of the female-dominated board. Shares fell 2.5 percent after Wednesday's vote.

Its multibillion-dollar fundraising effort more than doubles the next biggest offering of that type. But investors still don't know how the majority of that capital will be used. Many have been pouring in money based on hype and a promise that its founders, who have run other well-known blockchain projects, can repeat their success. Through the ICO, Block.one is offering a cryptocurrency called eos. Unlike an IPO, which gives investors stock ownership in a company, an ICO gives out tokens whose use case is based on a promise the platform will be useful in a digital network once it gets built. show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 Participants in the ICO used cryptocurrency ether instead of U.S. dollars in exchange for the new eos tokens.

At Thursday's U.S. dollar exchange rate of $576 per ether, the ICO has brought in the equivalent of $4.1 billion. This amount could change depending on the price of ether once the sale closes. In a March episode of \"Last Week Tonight,\" talk show host John Oliver highlighted eos in a monologue warning viewers about the \"speculative mania\" and risks of investing in cryptocurrency. \"It can be incredibly hard to tell which companies are for real,\" Oliver said during the episode, which has 5.98 million views on YouTube. \"If you want a good example of this, look at Block.one, which has raised $1.5 billion.\" \"It hasn't launched yet,\" Oliver said. He listed a host of concerns: the apparent lack of seriousness by advisor and noted early bitcoin investor Brock Pierce, the exponential pace of fundraising relative to established tech giants such as Facebook, and a Wall Street Journal report that called eos \"a software startup that doesn't plan to sell any software.\" The system, according to its founders, will support more efficient operations for \"decentralized applications\" than existing platforms such as ethereum.

U.S. regulators are set to rewrite rules reining in banks' risky trading behavior, making changes that will cut compliance costs but stopping far short of allowing firms to return to their gambling days seen before the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The Federal Reserve's long-anticipated proposal to alter the so-called Volcker Rule on Wednesday marks another step by Trump administration regulators to ease banking rules in a bid to boost lending and economic growth. Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Volcker Rule is aimed at preventing banks from making market bets while accepting taxpayer-insured deposits. It has forced many Wall Street banks to overhaul their trading operations and hive off billions of dollars worth of hedge funds and private equity funds. show chapters Powell: 'Sensible' for community banks to be exempt from Volcker rule 8:20 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 03:33 Banks have long complained that the rule, which took four years to write and runs at more than 1,000 pages, is vague and complex, creating a disproportionate compliance burden and limiting their ability to facilitate investments and hedges for investors. \"This revision is likely to make only modest changes to the rule that would benefit banks at the margin. It will not mark the wholesale return of bank proprietary trading. The fundamental framework remains,\" said Isaac Boltanksy, director of policy research at Compass Point Trading & Research in Washington. Still, Wednesday's proposal should provide clarity over how banks can show trades qualify for certain safe harbors, especially when facilitating client trades, according to people familiar with the matter. Reuters had reported the expected changes in February. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was once quoted as saying traders would need a lawyer and a psychiatrist by their side in order to prove their trading intentions complied with the rule. The proposed changes will also likely tailor compliance requirements to an institution's size and alter aspects of the rule so it no longer encroaches upon some overseas firms, the people said. JPMorgan is looking forward to more clarity on its requirements and to spending less to prove compliance, Daniel Pinto, chief executive for the bank's corporate and investment banking business, said at an investor conference on Tuesday. But the Volcker Rule proposal \"is not going to change too much what we do and how we do it,\" Pinto said. Banks of all sizes, as well as private-equity funds and investor groups, have lobbied hard for the rule to be simplified, according to public records and sources. U.S. Congress wrote the broad strokes of the Volcker Rule into law, but five regulators oversee the rule and wrote its finer details. Industry attempts to persuade Congress to overhaul the Volcker Rule so far have failed, but regulators agree after three years of trying to enforce it that revisions are necessary to help all parties. They have been working on tweaks ever since the rule became effective in 2015, but efforts behind the scenes to draft a new rule accelerated over the past two months, the sources said. The Fed has been leading the efforts and other regulators are expected to propose the same changes in the coming days. Some bank lobbyists hope for another opportunity to push for a more radical overhaul. But such changes could take years, analysts said. \"The only way that the Volcker Rule can be fundamentally altered is if Congress chooses to do so, and that clearly isn't happening this year or anytime in the near future,\" said Boltansky.

Here's why 8:04 AM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 03:00 The Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulatory agencies proposed Wednesday to revise the Volcker Rule to apply to financial firms based on their trading activity. \"This proposed rule will tailor the Volcker rule's requirements by focusing the most comprehensive compliance regime on the firms that do the most trading,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. \"Firms that do more modest amounts of trading will face fewer requirements.\" The Volcker Rule was proposed during the financial crisis in an effort to prevent banks from speculating in markets. The rule went into effect four years ago and generally prevents banks from trading for their own profit or having stakes in a hedge fund or private equity fund. Wednesday's proposal allows banks to have stakes in those funds in order to hedge risks for customers that aren't banks. The financial firms would also be able to trade for themselves on a limited basis, under the proposal. To determine the level of necessary compliance, the proposal divides banks into three categories. Those with trading assets and liabilities of at least $10 billion would need to comply with the strictest rules. Banking entities with trading assets and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion would be subject to \"reduced compliance requirements and a more tailored approach.\" Firms with less than $1 billion in worldwide trading assets and liabilities would be presumed compliant with parts of the rule and not have to demonstrate compliance. The proposal also said trading desks reporting an absolute daily net gain and loss for the past 90 days not exceeding $25 million would be presumed compliant with the prohibition on proprietary trading. \"The banking entity would have no obligation to demonstrate that such trading desk's activity complies with the rule on an ongoing basis.\" \"All of that is to say, I view this proposal as an important milestone in comprehensive Volcker rule reform, but not the completion of our work,\" the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, Randal K. Quarles, said in a statement.

But that could end soon as markets start to acknowledge the differences between these assets, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. \"There's a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies,\" Garlinghouse told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" Wednesday. \"It's early, over time you'll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that.\" Ripple is the name of the San Francisco-based company developing a network for faster global financial payments, while XRP is the name of the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. The company itself had a record first quarter, signing 20 production contracts with new firms, Garlinghouse said. Ripple announced a deal with the largest bank in Kuwait on Wednesday, adding to companies like MoneyGram that are already testing XRP for cross-border payments. show chapters Trader reveals one big thing investors are missing about ripple 8:23 PM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 04:42 Yet in that same time period, XRP lost 70 percent of its value and was the worst performer among the top digital currencies. The entire sector took a beating in the first quarter, and the market capitalization for cryptocurrencies fell by more than 50 percent, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin lost roughly 50 percent in those three months. \"It's still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity,\" Garlinghouse said. \"I think it's a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.\" There are more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The CEO predicted that 99 percent of those digital assets won't exist in 10 years. \"There's gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don't actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,\" he said. Not only do some cryptocurrencies have no proven use case, they have been accused of fleecing investors through a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned of pump-and-dump schemes, shut multiple down, and recently charged one backed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid with fraud. \"The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed,\" Garlinghouse said. \"We have been an advocate of yes the government should get involved, the government should be protecting investors and companies but there's also examples of real utility. The issue of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security has been a major focus for the financial watchdog. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities. But Ripple has maintained that the XRP cryptocurrency should be categorized differently. Garlinghouse pointed out a few differences between XRP and classic securities, like stocks. \"If you own XRP, you don't own rights to the profits or any dividends to the company,\" he said. \"XRP has real utility.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/03/08/105053492-_MG_4154.JPG?v=1520542014", "keywords": [{"category": "NORP", "term": "Momentum"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ripple"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "2:53 PM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "30"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "02:17 Cryptocurrency"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "thousands"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Brad Garlinghouse"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Power Lunch"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "San Francisco"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "first quarter"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "20"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Garlinghouse"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Kuwait"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "MoneyGram"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Trader"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:23 PM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "30"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "04:42"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "70 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first quarter"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 50 percent"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "roughly 50 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "those three months"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "more than 1,500"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "99 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "10 years"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Securities and Exchange Commission"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Floyd Mayweather"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "DJ Khalid"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jay Clayton"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "March"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ripple"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "XRP"}], "description": "Cryptocurrency prices have been highly correlated with bitcoin but that influence could end soon, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.

Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska stepped down as a director of his aluminum firm Rusal as part of a choreographed series of steps which he hopes will persuade the U.S. government to rescind sanctions that have crippled his businesses. Deripaska is now actively preparing the next step: reducing his stake in En+, the group which controls Rusal, to a level where Washington would be willing to remove his businesses from its sanctions blacklist, three sources familiar with the discussions said. Deripaska and the biggest companies in his empire were included on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions blacklist in April. Washington said he and fellow tycoons were profiting from association with a Kremlin conducting \"malign activities\" around the globe. show chapters The Trump-Russia ties hiding in plain sight 1:33 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 07:56 The sanctions paralyzed Rusal's supply chain, scared off many customers, froze Deripaska out of Western debt markets and sent shares in his major companies plummeting. In an illustration of the damage dealt by the sanctions, Russia's VTB bank said it had become owner of a 9.6 percent stake in En+ after the firm's stocks sank. The price slump triggered a margin call, forcing a minority shareholder, Singapore's AnAn Group, to relinquish the stake to the lender, a VTB executive said. In a statement issued in Hong Kong, where it is listed, Rusal said Deripaska, a non-executive director of the company, had stepped down as director. That came a day after the chief executive and seven board members quit, also in a move to distance the firm from Deripaska and his associates. Deripaska is seeking to persuade Washington to ease the sanctions on his businesses in exchange for him scaling back his association with his companies. The key element now is for him to reduce his controlling stake. One source familiar with the discussions said Deripaska had been intent on holding on to control, but has now accepted there is no alternative if his businesses are to survive. The maneuver under consideration, according to three sources familiar with the discussions, would mirror steps taken by another sanctioned Russian tycoon, Viktor Vekselberg. His Swiss-based company Sulzer bought some of Vekselberg's shares, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to say that Sulzer was not at risk from sanctions. Deripaska currently holds a 66 percent stake in En+. The group declined immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. show chapters We are not lending new money to Oleg Deripaska: VTB's Kostin 2:02 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 02:52 The three sources, who asked not to be named, said that the share buyback maneuver was one of several options under consideration for reducing Deripaska's stake. Talking to Washington The sources said Deripaska's representatives were in discussions with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which oversees sanctions, to establish if the maneuver would be deemed enough to remove the companies from the sanctions blacklist. \"It's one of the options being discussed now with OFAC,\" said one of the sources. A U.S. Treasury official, asked about any discussions with Deripaska's representatives on him reducing his stake, said OFAC does not generally comment on ongoing discussions about sanctions relief. \"OFAC reviews each request based on the facts and circumstances of the case and individual merits,\" the official said. Underlining the depth of the difficulties facing Deripaska's firms, a Russian government source said that Rusal had asked the Russian government to buy some of its output. Since sanctions hit, stocks of aluminum ingots have been stacking up at at least one Rusal plant, because buyers have canceled orders. The government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deripaska had also applied for loans for Rusal from Russian lender Promsvyazbank. The bank is under the control of the Russian central bank and has been earmarked by the Kremlin to provide finance to sanctioned Russian firms, a task most regular banks will not undertake because of the sanctions risk. Deripaska also sought state support for automaker GAZ, which is part of his business empire and has also been affected by the sanctions, the government source said. Russian authorities have approved a loan for GAZ, but no decision has yet been made on the loan request for Rusal, according to the source. Rusal did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on requests for state help.

Worldwide dealmaking for 2018 topped the $2 trillion mark this week, on track for the biggest year for mergers and acquisitions ever, according to data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. Global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start to a year ever, totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter and that action has continued in the second quarter. Media, telecom, consumer staples, healthcare and retail sectors have been especially hot. This week began with a standout \"Merger Monday\" of announced deals: General Electric confirmed it will merge its transportation business with U.S. manufacturer Wabtec in an $11.1 billion deal. Data firm IHS Markit said it will buy smaller rival from private-equity funds of Blackstone and Goldman Sachs for $1.86 billion, and U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp announced a $4.7 billion deal to buy MB Financial. Meanwhile, Blackstone said it would buy U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties for $3.7 billion. Global deals year-to-date Source: Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence Data as of May 21, 2018 Tax cuts helped set the stage for the recent boom in deals. The Republican tax reform bill, which was signed by President Trump in December, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and made it cheaper for multinational companies to repatriate foreign cash. Companies have been putting putting the extra savings to work with additional investments. The value of M&A deals globally increased 67 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows but the number of deals dropped by 10 percent, reflecting that the average size of deals is getting bigger. Among the mega- deals this year; U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp said it will acquire U.S. pharmacy chain Express Scripts for $67 billion, and German utility E.ON SE announced a $38.5 billion deal to buy RWE AG's renewable energy business. On the regulatory front though, there is still uncertainty. The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner over antitrust concerns, and later called the deal \"illegal\" and \"harmful\" to consumers.

We continue to look to broaden our core businesses, expand our franchise and find ways to enhance our growth and diversity of revenue streams.\" Goldman Sachs announced the $5 billion plan in September after being stung in recent years by a decline in fixed-income trading. The firm is the most dependent on trading revenue among the big U.S. investment banks, and its push involves growing clients beyond the hedge funds that were its historic strength. Part of the effort includes a new emphasis on consumer retail through its Marcus brand. \"We're now building a digital consumer finance platform,\" Solomon said. \"We think digital finance is at a very, very interesting pivot point. And we think we're in a position where we can be part of the disruption.\" The consumer business offers savings accounts and loans, but could ultimately spread to credit cards, mortgages, car loans, life and health insurance through Marcus, according to a bank presentation.

SoftBank Group said on Wednesday it is selling its roughly 20 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart to Walmart. Walmart said earlier this month it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, the U.S. retailer's largest-ever deal. SoftBank did not disclose terms of the sale but this month CEO Masayoshi Son said its investment in the Indian firm was worth around $4 billion. The Vision Fund invested 2.5 billion in Flipkart in August last year. It also did not comment on its reasons for cashing out. The Flipkart exit comes far more quickly than SoftBank's average investment duration of 13.5 years. The Vision Fund has invested $30 billion in startups in the last year.

Lastly, adjacent businesses, including OnStar, GM Financial and the company's aftermarket business, could add between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in profit over the next few years. \"That's another 10 bucks a share,\" said the analyst. Shares of General Motors were trading around $43 on Friday. But Susanin said it's worth closer to $75. New investments in self-driving vehicles will also help drive the stock higher. On Thursday, General Motors announced that SoftBank Vision Fund plans to invest $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, helping boost the company's stake in autonomous vehicles. Shares surged about 11 percent after the announcement. \"This is a very big deal,\" Susanin said. He said the company's market cap \u2014 currently close to $61 billion \u2014 will only continue to expand after GM launches a commercialized autonomous ride share, if the company can maintain lower prices than competitors such as Uber. GM said it will have the necessary capital to reach commercialization at scale in 2019. But investors have known about many of the strategies employed in GM's base business for some time, said Jamie Albertine, managing partner and automotive analyst at Consumer Edge Research, a research firm. And they likely won't move the market. \"On the pullout of GM Europe, we've known that for some time,\" Albertine said on \"Closing Bell\" Friday. He also pointed out that GM is overexposed in its car business in the United States and that the trucking business isn't growing that much. \"GM probably is in the best position of its OEM peers right now,\" Albertine said, referring to companies with goods used as parts in other company's products. \"But to see it double in two years, we think it's low probability,\" he said. \"It'll take more like five to seven years for this to play out, in our view.\" Disclaimer ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/20/105017154-GettyImages-167243747.jpg?v=1522687983", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "two years"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "6:43 PM ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "1"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "June 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "General Motors"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the next two years"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Christopher Susanin"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Levin Capital Strategies"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "about $30"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "about $10"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Susanin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Closing Bell"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "three"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "European"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Asian"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Cadillac"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Korea"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Susanin"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "a couple billion"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "two"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Cadillac"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "General Motors"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "almost a dollar"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "maybe 75 cents"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "almost another $10"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Susanin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "OnStar"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM Financial"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "between $1.5 billion and $2 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the next few years"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "General Motors"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "around $43"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Susanin"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "75"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "General Motors"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SoftBank Vision Fund"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$2.25 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM Cruise Holdings"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "about 11 percent"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Susanin"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "close to $61 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Uber"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2019"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jamie Albertine"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Consumer Edge Research"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM Europe"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Albertine"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Closing Bell"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "the United States"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "GM"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Albertine"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "two years"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "more like five to seven years"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Disclaimer"}], "description": "An analyst predicts General Motors stock will double in the next two years.

Bernstein | Bloomberg | Getty Images Randal Quarles, vice chairman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, speaks during a meeting with the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, May 30, 2018. He added, \"We're looking closely at where we can do that.\" On Wednesday the Fed and other regulators released a proposal to loosen restrictions on bank trading activity. The so-called Volcker Rule aimed to curtain risk taking, but the banking industry has long railed against the restrictions. \"The changes that we've proposed we think will significantly reduce the burden without undermining the objective,\" Quarles said Thursday. The rule went into effect four years ago and prevented banks from trading for their own profit or investing in hedge funds and private equity funds. The new proposal would allow banks to trade for themselves on a limited basis and would allow stakes in funds in order to hedge customer risks. It also applies the strictest rules on banks with big trading businesses and lifts them for banks that don't do much trading at all.

The bank is expected to raise rates in June, beginning a gradual series of increases that could span into the middle of next year. But some say the U.S. Federal Reserve won't be able to raise interest rates faster than its European and Japanese counterparts. \"It is hard for U.S. rates to get too far out of line with the global rate situation, and obviously both the [Bank of Japan] and the [European Central Bank] are continuing very accommodative policies,\" James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, market watchers were on edge Tuesday amid political turmoil in Italy and concerns over weak interest rates and a decline in global credit that could spell bad news for international debt holders. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 391.64 points, or 1.58 percent, to close at 24,361.45. The S&P 500 was down 1.16 percent to close at 2,689.86, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined by 0.5 percent to finish at 7,396.59.

Adobe CFO John Murphy said the program \"is reflective of our strong cash flow expectations and balance sheet, and reinforces our commitment to returning value and excess cash to our stockholders.\" Adobe also on Monday announced the $1.68 billion acquisition of e-commerce platform Magento Commerce, which executives expect will make the Adobe experience more \"shoppable.\" Shopify stock dropped nearly 3 percent in extended trading after Adobe announced its acquisition. Magento and Shopify are rivals in the e-commerce space. Pure Storage stock tanked nearly 8 percent in extended trading.

Pure Storage reported a loss of 7 cents on revenue of $255.9 million versus the 12 cent loss on $251.5 million analysts expected.

A U.S. recession probably won't happen for another two years, and in the meantime stocks are a good bet, according to closely followed Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Garthwaite. \"We conclude that a US recession is unlikely until Q3 2020,\" Garthwaite wrote in a note to clients Friday. \"Remain overweight equities.\" Typically, an inverted yield curve, when longer-term interest rates dip below shorter-term rates, and full employment with wage growth at 3.5 percent happen about a year before a recession. Garthwaite predicted those phenomena wouldn't hit the U.S. until halfway through 2019. Based on that timing and historical behavior, stocks could keep rising until 2020. In the past 50 years, with the exception of 1987, when the equity risk premium hit a very low 1 percent, \"equities have never peaked more than 13 months ahead of a recession,\" he said. High volatility is also here to stay, meaning credit is riskier than equity, Garthwaite said. He told clients to sell and \"remain cautious\" on highly leveraged companies with low free cash flow, such as GlaxoSmithKline. But the Credit Suisse analyst is not bullish on all sectors. Garthwaite suggested staying underweight non-financial cyclicals such as consumer discretionary, materials and industrials, calling them \"expensive\" and \"over-owned.\" He instead favors lowly leveraged defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, health care and telecoms. \"At this stage of yield curve flattening, normally software and energy are the best performing sectors, while consumer staples and utilities perform the worst,\" Garthwaite said.

has conceded the bank faces an uphill battle against a barrage of bad \"newsflow.\" Deutsche Bank's long-running turmoil was dealt a fresh blow Thursday, when share prices tumbled after it was reported that the Federal Reserve labeled the bank's U.S. business as being in a \"troubled condition.\" Less than 24 hours later, influential group Standard & Poor's slashed its credit rating, potentially raising the cost of its borrowing. The ratings agency also questioned whether Deutsche Bank's CEO Christian Sewing would be able to return the bank to profit. \"Let's be straightforward: the newsflow is not good... I know that the current newsflow must give you the feeling that the bank is not getting any respite. That's why I think it's important for me to put this news in perspective,\" Sewing said in a letter to staff Friday. \"At group level, our financial strength is beyond doubt,\" he added. Germany's biggest bank 'vulnerable to speculation' Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the Federal Reserve had downgraded Deutsche Bank's U.S. business to one of the lowest possible designations last year. Meanwhile, the Financial Times also reported Thursday, citing a source, that Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiary was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's list of \"problem banks,\" or those with weaknesses that threaten their financial survival. The news prompted shares of Deutsche Bank to collapse to their lowest-ever closing level Thursday. Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters Christian Sewing, CEO of Germany's Deutsche Bank, addresses the audience during the bank's annual meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, May 24, 2018. Nonetheless, in in his letter to staff Friday, Sewing insisted that credit and market risk levels had rarely been so low, speculation it was exposed to Italian turmoil was unfounded and funding plans for 2018 were progressing at a steady pace. \"Let's face it, this is a situation where we are \u2014 if you look at our share price yesterday \u2014 vulnerable to speculation,\" Deutsche Bank's chief spokesperson, Joerg Eigendorf, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Friday. \"The management has a plan, the management is executing on their plan and I can promise you there is no lack of determination,\" he added.

Economic Cycle Research Institute co-founder Lakshman Achuthan warned on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" that an economic slowdown is already here \u2014 suggesting that Wall Street is dangerously optimistic right now. \"There's some tension here between what's going on with the economy outside your window and what's going on with expectations on Wall Street,\" Achuthan said Monday. \"There is a stealth slowdown already happening.\" He provided a chart that showed real consumer spending and income growth \"rolling over.\" \"Since late last year, consumer spending growth has been easing, as has personal income growth,\" he noted. \"That points to a fresh softening in a big part of the U.S. economy.\" That's not the only bearish trend in the chart, according to Achuthan. \"Spending is outpacing income growth,\" he said. \"That puts a lot of pressure on consumers, especially if interest rates are starting to rise.\" His thoughts came as the Dow was rallying to close above the 25,000 mark for the first time since March. The index is now positive for the year. The S&P 500 also had a strong day, settling up 0.74 percent on Monday for its best day since May 10. Achuthan wasn't sure when Wall Street could begin taking the economic sluggishness more seriously. But he still concluded that stocks are \"cruising for a bruising right here.\" \"From an economic cycle risk point of view, the risk is rising,\" Achuthan said. \"We have further slowing to go.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

The Tallinn, Estonia-based start-up secured a $1 billion valuation after the investment, helping it enter the ranks of Europe's unicorn companies. Korelya Capital, a French venture capital fund, Taavet Hinrikus, the co-founder of U.K.-based money transfer start-up TransferWise, and existing investor Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing firm, all participated in the round. Daimler, which owns Uber competitor MyTaxi, will join Taxify's board following the investment. \"Taxify is an ideal addition to our existing and extensive mobility services portfolio,\" Joerg Lamparter, head of mobility services at Daimler Financial Services, said in a statement Wednesday. Taxify currently has 10 million customers signed up to its platform and is present in 25 countries. The company entered London, a key battleground for Uber, last year. Taxify said it would use the latest investment to develop its technology and further expand in home markets like Europe and Africa. The investment comes as Uber, the world's best known ride-hailing start-up, tries to reshape its public image under new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. Under former boss Travis Kalanick, Uber was hit with a series of scandals, from sexual harassment complaints against the company, to allegations that it tried to evade regulation in various cities. In London, the company is fighting to keep its license to operate after a ban by the city's transport regulator last year. Also in 2017, a British judge ruled that Uber drivers should be classified as formal workers rather than as self-employed, presenting a challenge for both Uber and the so-called \"gig economy.\" Uber has long maintained that its drivers are self-employed rather than employees, and are therefore not entitled to rights including holiday pay and a minimum wage.

Nordstrom's recent earnings sell-off presents a compelling buying opportunity, according to Deutsche Bank, which upgraded the stock to a buy rating and called the drop in share price \"overdone.\" \"We believe Nordstrom has the best developed digital strategy within our department store coverage, with 29 percent of sales now digitally enabled,\" analyst Paul Trussell wrote Wednesday. This, \"combined with a relatively small store network and increasing penetration of exclusive/limited distribution brands, positions the company well in the long run for market share gains.\" Though the company missed first-quarter earnings in March, the analyst argued that the fact it raised the lower end of its earnings per share estimates for fiscal year 2018 was encouraging. The analyst estimates the retailer will generate fiscal 2018 earnings per share of $3.55 versus the Wall Street consensus of $3.46, according to FactSet data. \"We see modest upside to estimates as a number of initiatives gain traction throughout the year, including the focus on the addition of new, differentiated and exclusive brands, combined with lean inventory positions at both Nordstrom and department store peers and improving macro data points,\" he said. Trussell revised his price target on shares of Nordstrom higher to $55 from $52, implying more than 20 percent upside from Tuesday's close. The stock, however, has underperformed in 2018; shares are down 3.4 percent since January against the S&P 500's 1.9 percent climb.

But the first step is, let's legislate first; let's regulate first. So we know what the playing field looks like.\" The Department of Justice this week launched an investigation into whether traders have been manipulating the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2014 part of increased regulatory scrutiny in the sector. Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched HoweyCoins.com, a phony website designed to teach investors what fraudulent initial coin offerings might look like. The North American Securities Administrators Association's \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" a look into 70 possible crypto schemes, also began in May. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital investment firm BKCM, told CNBC on \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday that the DOJ's probe is not necessarily a bad thing. \"They'll be able to clean [cryptocurrency exchanges] up a little bit,\" said Kelly. Neu-Ner said that with a smaller market size and fewer people in an unregulated and often misunderstood industry, it was easier to take advantage of what was unknown. Now though, he said, regulations are a good thing, as manipulation would be harder with \"eyes everywhere.\" \"Everyone is worried about who's watching,\" he said. Kelly agreed, pointing out that clear regulatory guidelines and a manipulation-free market were some of the SEC's guidelines for a physically backed exchange-traded fund. \"This is one more step toward the maturation of this process,\" Kelly said. Neu-Ner has previously warned investors and regulators alike about the need to establish regulations on ICOs. Without them, he said, the U.S. could risk \"falling behind\" other countries in terms of innovation and hosting companies that use blockchain technology.

TWEET The statement comes as the White House negotiates the framework of a deal to avoid tariffs between the countries. The administration has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports unless China cuts its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion in two years, aiming to spur China's buying of billions more in U.S. goods. Investors were hopeful a deal could be close after Treasury Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the trade war was \"on hold.\" On Saturday, the U.S. and China issued a joint statement on trade consultations saying \"both sides agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports. The United States will send a team to China to work out the details.\" The tentative deal would involve increased U.S. exports of goods such as agricultural and energy commodities and China lowering of trade barriers. In tweets Monday morning, the president said China \"has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products,\" and wrote separately that barriers and tariffs would \"come down\" for the \"first time.\" Trump's key advisors are still working on the details.

But on Tuesday, Trump said he was \"not satisfied\" with the trade talks taking place. His comments hit the stock market and continued to weigh on stocks Wednesday. Another deal is apparently on thin ice as well. Trump said Tuesday that the highly anticipated summit with North Korea may not happen after all. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave more details Wednesday, saying the U.S. is prepared to walk away from negotiations with North Korea if upcoming talks on its nuclear weapons program head in the wrong direction, and that \"a bad deal is not an option.\" \"The American people are counting on us to get this right. If the right deal is not on the table, we will respectfully walk away,\" Pompeo said in his opening remarks for a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.

Pity the Wall Street analyst. The ranks of investment-bank research analysts have been shrinking for years amid new regulations and subdued trading markets. Now European rules that unbundle research and trade execution has resulted in clients spending about 25 percent less on reports compared with a year earlier, according to Daniel Pinto, JP Morgan Chase co-president. Asset managers and hedge funds are likely to continue penny pinching when it comes to research, Pinto said Tuesday at a conference in New York. Previously, clients paid for research by funneling trade commissions to banks. That changed when European regulators rolled out the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, in January, forcing clients to pay for research and trades separately. \"Now that everyone is seeing what they are consuming, what they aren't, and the value of it, there will probably be another shrinkage of consumption'' beyond the 25 percent that has already happened, Pinto, 55, said Tuesday in a conference in New York. ``I think there will be one more leg down.'' Speaking about the industry, he added: \"The millions of pages we write about many things, it may not be what clients are willing to pay for.\" There is a silver lining at investment banks, but it's for traders, not research analysts who write reports and offer recommendations on stocks. While firms make less money from research, the biggest banks with the latest technology will get a larger share of trade orders, Pinto said. \"There is some evidence of that happening already,\" he said. \"Great analysts will always be valuable,\" Pinto said, adding that he hasn't reduced head count in his research department yet because he wants to see several more quarters of client behavior before making cuts. An unexpected change resulting from the rules is that clients are more likely to attend \u2014 and pay for \u2014 in-person events such as conferences, where it's possible to get analysts' views in person rather than paying for the research. Clients are heading to \"environments where they can see a lot of it at one time, so the conferences are being better attended than they were before,\" Pinto said.

Stacey Cunningham, NYSE Group's newly named president, said initial public offerings are lined up for June as the Big Board continues to battle Nasdaq for new listings. Regulation and private equity capital have kept many smaller companies out of the public markets for far longer than they used to wait to start trading stock, and that is one of the challenges to the business, she told CNBC Tuesday in an interview from the floor of the NYSE. As of Tuesday, 77 initial public offerings have filed this year, up 8.5 percent from this time last year, according to Renaissance Capital. Companies listing have raised $22.7 billion, up 35 percent. NYSE has scored some of the higher profile new listings in the last year, including Snap and Blue Apron. Spotify also listed there for the first time earlier this year, though using a slightly different method. \"We do have a strong pipeline coming up in June,\" Cunningham said on CNBC. \"But we want to make sure we haven't gone too far to a market structure that has created and environment that's good for big companies and big investors. We want to be able to welcome companies of small sizes earlier in their life.\" NYSE's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, named Cunningham NYSE Group''s president on Tuesday. Cunningham, who began working on the floor of the exchange after college in the mid-1990s is the first woman to hold that title there. She takes on the role officially on Friday. At Nasdaq, Adena Friedman has been CEO since last year. In the early 2000s, before ICE acquired NYSE, Catherine Kinney was co-president of the exchange. Cunningham said she doesn't plan to make drastic changes like getting rid of the NYSE's physical trading floor, even though she admits it's no longer really necessary to have one. \"I grew up down here. I certainly hope we are sitting here in five years,\" she said. \"This community provides value.\" Cunningham is taking over from Tom Farley, who is moving on to head up Far Point Acquisition, a blank check company that will focus on acquiring fintech businesses. Far Point is an affiliate of Dan Loeb's Third Point. It plans to raise $400 million in an initial public offering, it said Tuesday in a regulatory filing. The IPO will be at NYSE, though the timing is unclear.

Speaking a day after the central bank released minutes from its May meeting, Kaplan said the Fed still has work to do before it can say it has its benchmark funds rate at a level that is considered \"neutral\" for growth. \"My own view is we should be raising rates until we get to neutral,\" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas. \"We should do it gradually. I'm not prepared to say yet I want to go above neutral.\" The release of the minutes moved markets Wednesday afternoon, likely on commentary out of the meeting summary that indicated the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, of which Kaplan is a nonvoting member, is willing to let inflation run a bit hotter than normal as the economy continues in recovery phase. That could mean the Fed will take a more dovish approach to policy, holding off on raising rates even if inflation climbs above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Kaplan said he is in the camp that would be willing to let conditions heat up a bit. \"I want to run around 2, and if we got a little bit above it and I thought it would be short term and not long term, I could tolerate it,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"If I thought it would persist I think it would affect my policy views.\" On top of the increase already approved in March, market participants widely expect the Fed to hike its benchmark rate a quarter point in June, followed by another move in September. However, traders have sharply pared back expectations for a fourth move in December. Last week, the market saw chances of a fourth increase above 50 percent; that fell to just above 40 percent as of Thursday morning. Fed officials have been discussing where they might reach a \"neutral\" rate that is neither stimulative nor restrictive. Kaplan said he estimates that it's between 2.5 percent and 2.75 percent, compared with the 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent current target range. On a separate matter, Kaplan said he is watching conditions in emerging economies such as Turkey and Argentina and the effects that Fed rate increases have in those parts of the world. He said that Fed tightening could trigger restraints on capital flows. \"If that gets pronounced enough, that could lead to a rapid tightening in conditions in the United States, which in turn could slow the economy,\" he said. He spoke before President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of his summit with North Korea.

A British court has dismissed charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) against Barclays over its 2008 capital raising, the bank said on Monday, suspending for now the threat of regulatory sanctions on its business operations. The SFO was, however, not prepared to let the case drop. \"We are likely to seek to reinstate the charges by applying to the High Court,\" an SFO spokesman said. It was not clear when that application would be heard. Barclays denied the SFO's allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped it avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis, unlike its rivals Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. An end to the SFO's case against Barclays and its operating subsidiary would remove the biggest remaining legal headache facing Barclays over its conduct during the financial crisis. The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions would also represent a major setback for the SFO, with the prosecutor's office under fire from politicians in recent years. Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing itself, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as \"financial assistance\". The SFO had been pursuing charges that Barclays unlawfully received such financial assistance, and that it had conspired with former senior executives to commit fraud over two so-called 'advisory services agreements' between Qatar and the bank which facilitated the fundraising. Not over yet Even if the SFO were to fail in its efforts to reinstate the charges, Barclays still faces other legal and regulatory problems related to the 2008 fundraising. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the advisory services agreements. Separately four former Barclays bankers face a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, in a trial due to start next January. Jack Taylor | Getty Images Former Chief Executive of Barclays John Varley (C) arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court on July 3, 2017 in London, England. Mr Varley today appears with three other former executives of Barclays in relation to a Serious Fraud Office investigation over the way the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. The four are former chief executive John Varley, and senior executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath. Barclays said the dismissal of the charges against itself should not be taken to have any bearing on whether other people may have committed a criminal offence. Lawyers representing Boath and Jenkins declined to comment, while lawyers for the other two did not immediately respond to requests for comment. British businesswoman Amanda Staveley has a separate $1 billion civil lawsuit against Barclays over the same fundraising. Staveley's private equity group PCP Capital Partners is claiming damages for alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in a row over whether Barclays offered Qatar and Abu Dhabi investors the same deal terms for participating in a fundraising in 2008. Barclays has called the PCP lawsuit \"misconceived.\" Staveley declined to comment. Barclays shares were up 0.7 percent by 1300 GMT, in line with the FTSE 350 British banks index.

Analysts on Wall Street are really divided on the trajectory of electric car maker Tesla and it shows in their stock price forecasts.

By comparing coefficients of variation \u2014 a statistical measures of the dispersion of targets around an average \u2014 the stocks Wall Street is most uncertain about become more obvious.

For example, Baird reiterated its outperform rating on Wednesday, predicting the Palo Alto, California-based automaker will make significant progress in its Model 3 output. The firm''s analyst, Ben Kallo, reaffirmed his $411 price target for Tesla shares, representing 48 percent upside to Thursday's close. \"Negative headlines have increased substantially in the past month and, in our opinion, increasingly immaterial reports have dominated news cycles,\" Kallo said in a note. \"We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment.\" German investment bank Berenberg also remained upbeat earlier this week, contending that Model 3 gross margins will \"positively surprise.\" The firm raised its price target for Tesla to $500 from $470, representing 80 percent upside to Thursday's close, predicting it will be able to meet its 25 percent gross profit margin forecast for the Model 3. The investment bank also reiterated its buy rating on the stock. Some analysts aren't convinced, however, including Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas. The analyst slashed his price target to $291 from $376 for Tesla shares last Tuesday, saying the firm is \"making material reductions to our earnings estimates to reflect lingering manufacturing issues.\" \"It is our view that the challenges in ramping up Model 3 production reflect fundamental issues of vehicle design, manufacturing process, and automation levels that can weigh against the profitability of the vehicle,\" Jonas wrote. Tesla's share price, which has declined nearly 11 percent this year, is closely related to Model 3 production. The percentage of Tesla's available stock currently sold short exceeds 30 percent, according to FactSet. Goldman Sachs isn't a fan, either. \"We believe the sustainable production rate for the second quarter of 2018 is most likely below the 2,000 vehicle mark the company achieved in the final week of the [first] quarter,\" Goldman analyst David Tamberrino wrote last month. \"We see the company likely sustaining Model 3 production around the 1,400 per week mark.\" Disclosure: Jon Najarian is a frequent guest on CNBC's \"Fast Money: Halftime Report.\" WATCH: Tesla's troubles continue show chapters Tesla's troubles continue 6:03 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 05:11 Disclaimer ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/07/104994086-RTX4RL3Z.jpg?v=1534179983", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Joe Skipper"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Reuters"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Elon Musk"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "only two"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Dish Network"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "more than 800"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "more than $5 billion"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "500px;border"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Commenting"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jon Najarian"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Najarian Family Office"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bill Ackman"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Najarian"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "LANGUAGE", "term": "Dish"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "AT&T"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "AT&T"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "4:30 AM ET Fri"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "25"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "02:50 Still"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past few weeks"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Baird"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Palo Alto"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "California"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Model 3"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Ben Kallo"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "411"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "48 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past month"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Kallo"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "German"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Berenberg"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "earlier this week"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Model 3"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "Tesla to $500"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "470"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "80 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "25 percent"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "the Model 3"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Morgan Stanley's"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Adam Jonas"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "291"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "376"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last Tuesday"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Model 3"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jonas"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "nearly 11 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Model 3"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "30 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "FactSet"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Goldman Sachs"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the second quarter of 2018"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "2,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the final week"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Goldman"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "David Tamberrino"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last month"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Model 3"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jon Najarian"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Fast Money: Halftime Report"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tesla"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "6:03 PM ET Mon"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "21"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Analysts at the nation's top brokerages are divided on the trajectory of electric car maker Tesla.

Siegel, who helped lead 2017's rally cry, told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" that he isn't blaming Italy's political turmoil, the latest headline to rock the markets, for a borderline bearish forecast. Rather, he cited risks from rising rates to trade tensions. \"The major threat of the market is higher interest rates going forward. Too many people read the FOMC minutes as being too dovish,\" he said Wednesday. Siegel expects the Federal Reserve to hike rates a total of four times this year, a number Wall Street may be dangerously underestimating. As rates rise, stocks historically look less appealing to investors. He's also viewing trade tensions with China as a \"wild card\" for the market. \"[President Donald Trump] feels he has to tread very, very carefully on this. It doesn't mean for sure he won't go full blast forward,\" Siegel said. \"Caution is going to be the word here.\" His thoughts came as stocks staged a comeback a day after Italy tensions rattled the market. The Dow grabbed 306 points to close at 24,667. But it still fell short of breaking even from Tuesday's losses. Siegel has been warning since December that 2018 wouldn't be as robust as 2017, and stocks would be flat to up 10 percent by year-end. \"This is a great year for earnings, no one argues with that. But the tax cut is front-loaded which means that the write-offs on capital equipment are going to accrue to 2018 and not nearly as much in 2019,\" Siegel said.

For starters, the size of the Chinese market presented an attractive proposition. \"It's too big to ignore. This year, Guangdong Province has become larger than the entire Russian economy and I could reel off about a dozen other statistics like that. It's just so big now and yet people have always treated it as a tactical bet, so they've never really owned much of it,\" Matthews said. Foreign ownership of A shares, or Chinese stocks traded on the mainland, is relatively low, with most estimates currently putting the figure at around 2 percent. Better management in the country on a macro level was another positive factor, said Matthews. He cited the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy to boost local industry, the far-reaching Belt and Road Initiative and deleveraging as examples of those improvements. \"And the companies are much better than they were 10 years ago,\" he added. Chinese assets also did not look expensive, according to Matthews. \"There's no other market in Asia that has this kind of value,\" he said. Ahead, MSCI's addition of A shares to its equity indexes is set to take place on June 1. \"We know that's just a first step so there'll be a lot more allocation to come,\" Matthews said.

The world is becoming a much more dangerous place to live,\" he said. \"And that's a great concern.\" Kostin's comments come amid a cold front \u2014 the coldest in a while \u2014between Russia and the West. Among the sources of tension are Russia's support for the authoritarian regime in Syria, a suspected Moscow-directed nerve agent attack on U.K. soil, and alleged meddling in elections in the U.S. in 2016, alongside accusations of state-sponsored cyber warfare.

VTB is majority-owned by the Russian state.

But he called the restrictions \"unfair\" and denied he was a government official, saying \"I am a banker.\" On a wider level, although Kostin conceded that economic sanctions had weakened the Russian economy \u2014 which went through a recession in 2015 and 2016 amid sanctions and low oil prices, but grew in 2017 \u2014 it had helped to unify the population. \"Unfortunately, they strengthened anti-American feelings inside the Russian society,\" he said. show chapters Russia's macro outlook is stable, but its lack of labor is a problem: VTB Bank 3:24 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 03:11 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/19/104718723-GettyImages-843351248.jpg?v=1505835842", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "Diplomatic"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Moscow"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Cuban"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "America"}, {"category": "EVENT", "term": "World War III"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Andrei Kostin"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "VTB Bank"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Geoff Cutmore"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Moscow"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "55 percent"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russians"}, {"category": "EVENT", "term": "World War III"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "the United States"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kostin"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "\u2014between"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "West"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Syria"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Moscow"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.K."}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2016"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Crimea"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2014"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russian"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Ukraine"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "same year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Oleg Deripaska"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "VTB"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kostin"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "2:02 AM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "23"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "02:52 Moscow"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.K."}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the U.S."}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "April"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the U.S. Treasury"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russian"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "VTB"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kostin \u2014"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Vladimir Putin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "VTB"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russian"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kostin"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Kostin"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russian"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2015"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2016"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "American"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Russian"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Russia"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "VTB Bank"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "3:24 AM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "23"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Diplomatic tensions and the \"aggressive policy\" of the U.S. toward Russia are of more concern than sanctions, Andrei Kostin told CNBC.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/world-war-iii-worries-me-more-than-sanctions-do-says-vtb-bank-chief.html", "author": "Salvatore Laporta | Kontrolab | LightRocket | Getty Images", "title": "'World War III' worries me more than economic sanctions, says chief of Russia's VTB Bank"}, {"time": "2018-06-01T02:52:32-0400", "body": " Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Close to 230 China A shares debuted on index provider MSCI's emerging markets benchmark on Friday, a move investors expect will attract billions of dollars in inflows to the mainland market. The partial inclusion of the A shares \u2014 yuan-denominated stocks traded on the mainland \u2014 to MSCI's Emerging Markets Index takes place in two phases, with the second step only coming in August. Among the names included were a mix of financials, consumer and developer names such as Kweichow Moutai, which makes premium liquor; BYD, an electric vehicle manufacturer; China's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Ping An Insurance. ZTE, the telecommunications equipment company currently banned from purchasing U.S. technology, and four other names were not added, MSCI said earlier in the week. Upon completion of initial A shares inclusion, China's proportion of the index \u2014 which currently includes shares of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong \u2014 will stand at 31.3 percent. Full inclusion would see A shares account for 16 percent of the index and China making up 42 percent of the index. Friday's inclusion, however, failed to buoy sentiment in greater China markets, which slipped in afternoon trade: The Shanghai composite declined 0.53 percent and the smaller Shenzhen composite fell 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was lower by 0.17 percent. The dip came after more than 1 percent gains on benchmarks in Hong Kong and on the mainland in the last session. Mostly symbolic, for now The move is seen as an important symbolic one, even though the roughly $22 billion in capital inflows expected to go into A shares is seen as a drop in the bucket compared to the size of China's domestic market. \"The quantum of dollars right now is relatively small ... but what it does is it starts a process that will include China A shares as a bigger and bigger component of this very important benchmark over time,\" Jon Howie, head of equity index strategy at BlackRock, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" show chapters The pros and cons of China's A-shares MSCI EM inclusion 3:06 AM ET Fri, 1 June 2018 | 04:41 Although the move will have a limited impact on the A share market, it was still an extremely significant step in the opening-up process of China's capital account, said Haibin Zhu and Karen Li, J.P. Morgan's chief China economist and head of China equity research, respectively. \"China's equity market now officially enters the global space,\" the J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note. A full inclusion in the future would also suggest more changes on the horizon for the mainland market. \"Certainly if you get up to full weighting, then it's going to be a very different emerging markets index, but you would think also it's going to be a very different China as well,\" said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst. \"Ultimately, MSCI is agnostic on the stocks to a large extent, they're looking at them for structure: Can I get my money in and out? Is it safe to invest? Have I got some degree of investor protection? And if you're at 100 percent, then China's really opened up in quite a dramatic way,\" he added. Lingering concerns But even though the event, which was some five years in the making, \"could change the face of EM investing,\" concerns over issues such as market intervention and capital controls have persisted. \"Of course there are some issues remaining. Trading suspension is one of the issues, there is also potentially a CNH (off-shore yuan) issue. But the process is very progressive,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale. He added that MSCI's decision to give A shares the thumbs up after three years of rejecting them meant that some efforts to rectify issues had been taken by Chinese regulators and exchanges. \"Liquidity risk and market intervention, unfortunately, would be part and parcel of investing in A shares at this stage,\" Pruksa Iamthongthong, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, told CNBC's \"Street Signs.\" Still, as more institutional investors participate in the market and as regulators deal with new rules, things could \"become more conventional\" in the future, Iamthongthong said. \u2014 CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.

In fact, she said the U.S. market has been overweight from a combination of added stimulus from tax reform, a February spending package that filters into government agencies and global turmoil that benefits the U.S. market. \"We've found over the last few decades, when you have market panic, even if the U.S. causes the panic, the U.S. tends to outperform,\" Patterson said Wednesday on \"Fast Money.\" \"Some of that is Americans bringing money home in times of stress, and we bring a lot of money home,\" said Patterson, who serves as managing director and chief investment officer at Bessemer, a privately owned wealth management firm. \"And it's also that capital repatriation lifts the dollar,\" she said. The U.S. market fell sharply Tuesday with all three major indices closing lower. Amid concerns about Italy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 500 points at its lows. But the market rallied Wednesday as the Dow jumped more than 300 points and banks rebounded. The S&P 500 also rose, adding 1.27 percent and closing at 2,724.01. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 index hit a record, adding 1.5 percent and closing at 1,647.99. In the European markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 and Italy's FTSE MIB also rallied. But Patterson pointed out that, in the last month, the FTSE MIB, the benchmark stock market index for the Borsa Italiana, the Italian National Stock Exchange, has been down about 10 percent. \"There's a decent probability you get a populist government [in Italy],\" Patterson said. \"If you get a populist government, it would be very hard for the ECB, the central bank, to continue buying Italian bonds as part of its quantitative easing program.\" \"I would prefer to put my money somewhere else right now,\" she said. And it's not just Italy that Patterson expressed concerns about: The Japanese Nikkei 225 is down approximately 9 percent in the last month, and Brazil's Bovespa is down about 13 percent since February.

A Goldman Sachs banker has been charged with insider trading. A seven-count criminal complaint unsealed Thursday charged Woojae \"Steve\" Jung with trading with an unnamed co-conspirator on material nonpublic information he accessed while working at an investment bank with offices in New York and San Francisco. The complaint did not mention the bank by name, but the only FINRA record for a Woojae Jung lists Goldman Sachs as the employer. A LinkedIn profile page for a Steve Woojae Jung states he is vice president, investment banking, at Goldman Sachs. show chapters Goldman puts VP Jung on leave after insider trading charges 3:55 PM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 00:28 \"We are aware of the situation regarding Mr. Jung and are cooperating with legal authorities on the matter,\" Goldman said in a statement. The bank also said it is putting Jung on leave. Jung's lawyer Christopher Steskal did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. W.R. Grace, SanDisk, KLA-Tencor and Microsemi are among the stocks allegedly involved in the insider trading scheme, the court documents showed. In each case, Jung accessed sensitive, market-moving information through the investment bank, which was involved in potential restructuring or acquisition deals, according to the documents. In all, 37-year-old Jung and his 38-year-old co-conspirator traded in securities of 12 different companies based on the material, nonpublic information and generated profits of about $140,000 between 2015 and 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate complaint Thursday.

Bullard, who has previously flagged the need for a caution in raising rates, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar in Tokyo on Tuesday the Fed had enough tools and policy options to respond if the U.S. economy falls into a recession. He said in a speech earlier in the day that U.S. interest rates may have already hit the \"neutral\" level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. \"It is hard for U.S. rates to get too far out of line with the global rate situation, and obviously both the (Bank of Japan) and the (European Central Bank) are continuing very accommodative policies,\" Bullard told reporters. \"Is it constraining? It is in the sense that there is a global equilibrium of rates and if you get too far out of line things have to happen, exchange rates have to move, and other things have to happen.\" Bullard said he did not want to prejudge the Fed's next meeting in June, but he reiterated his view that the Fed does not need to raise interest rates further because inflation expectations are low. The Fed held interest rates steady in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent on May 2. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates in June, and continue a gradual series of increases until perhaps the middle of next year. In prepared remarks, Bullard repeated his views that inflation expectations remain a bit below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, and that interest rates worldwide are being held down by longer-term economic and demographic trends. There are \"a few reasons for caution\" in further rate increases, said Bullard, who has argued before that the Fed should halt its rate raising cycle until it is clear that economic growth and inflation have moved into a higher gear. If the current policy rate is at neutral, \"it may not be necessary to change the policy rate\" in order to keep the economy close to or at the Fed's goal, Bullard said. Holding off on further rate increases, he said, would help improve market-based measures of inflation expectations and make the Fed's commitment to meeting its inflation target more credible. It would also lower risks that short-term interest rates might rise above long-term ones, an \"inversion\" of the yield curve that has often preceded a recession. When asked whether the BOJ should change its 2 percent inflation target, Bullard said he saw no need for a change because 2 percent inflation has become a global standard for price targeting. He added that a central bank that changed its inflation target from 2 percent effectively commits itself to a significant change in its currency level, due to the consequent shift in interest rate expectations.

Goldman Sachs made $200 million in profit on a single day this February as calm in stock markets was shattered with a historic surge in volatility, according to people with knowledge of the move. That's on par with what the firm's derivatives unit typically makes in an entire year, said the people. The investment bank had positioned itself to benefit if the Cboe Volatility Index, the product sometimes called the \"fear index\" because it reflects expectations of future volatility, climbed, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about internal matters. After months of tranquil markets, on Feb. 5 the VIX surged 116 percent, the biggest one-day move on record, as the S&P 500 plunged 4.1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 1,100 points. Source: CNBC As a result, Goldman's hedge fund and asset management clients clamored for VIX exposure on the chance it would climb further, and the New York-based bank's positions were suddenly highly profitable. It was a boon for Goldman's flow derivatives group, run by managing director David Casner, who joined in 2002. The business, a team within Goldman's larger equities division that trades securities like VIX options, had been stung in recent years by calm markets and regulation. During all of last year, the bank's entire trading business exceeded $100 million in revenue on just four days, the company said in February. Pushing for No. 1 Driven by their recent performance and investments in trading technology that are starting to pay off, Goldman equities executives are optimistic they can regain the No. 1 ranking they have ceded to rival Morgan Stanley by year-end, according to the sources. J.P. Morgan Chase has also made gains against Goldman in recent years, a move that the investment bank's traders are eager to counter. Goldman's volatility bet helped fuel the 38 percent increase in first-quarter equities trading revenue to $2.3 billion, exceeding the increase by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan. The firm is known for managing risks well, but such trading moves aren't without potential hazards. If the market had gone the other way, they were exposed to losses, similar to wrong-way bets in commodities that stung Goldman in 2017. Perhaps with his recent equity performance in mind, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein defended his bank's beleaguered trading business when he spoke at a conference later in February. \"I don't think it would be a good strategic move to forgo the upside in the business from here,\" Blankfein said. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

The chances of a landslide victory for Mexico's far-left presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, are growing and that is scaring investors. Mexico's benchmark stock index, the S&P/BMV IPC, plummeted 7.6 percent in May, marking its biggest one-month decline since February 2009. The iShares MSCI Mexico exchange-traded fund (EWW) \u2014 which tracks Mexican stocks \u2014 plunged 13.4 percent last month, its largest monthly loss since September 2011. The move lower in Mexican stocks comes as Lopez Obrador, better known as AMLO, extended his lead over his opponents last month. show chapters NAFTA good for US, Mexico, and Canada, says former Mexican President Fox 3:42 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 01:08 A poll conducted by Mexican daily Reforma between May 24 and May 27 showed 52 percent of voters would choose AMLO to become the country's next president, up from 48 percent in late April. Parametria, a polling agency based in Mexico City, found AMLO's preference among voters grew to 45 percent in late May from 38 percent earlier in the month. People are realizing that AMLO might not just win the July 1 contest, but win by a landslide, said Jorge Mariscal, emerging markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. \"There was an expectation that he would win, but that he would have a check from other parties in congress.\" \"If he wins by a landslide, it is a given that his party, Morena, will get significant participation in congress. It's not clear that they will get the 51 percent majority, but it's certainly possible,\" Mariscal said. He added that a congressional majority for AMLO's Morena party would allow him to change the constitution. Some of AMLO's proposals include giving free access to telecommunication services like the internet and doubling the pension for the elderly. He also said in his platform that salaries \"will rise as a principle of justice and to promote domestic consumption and markets.\" AMLO's rise to the top of the polls and the fall in Mexican equities come as Mexico continues negotiations with Canada and the United States on a new trade deal. President Donald Trump has railed against the current deal, NAFTA, calling it the worst ever. Trade tensions between the three countries rose this week after the Trump administration said it would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico.

The company announced a partnership with 17 schools Monday, including the University of North Carolina, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. Through the \"University Blockchain Research Initiative\" program, Ripple will donate $50 million for research and development in blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital payments. The donation is in dollars and not the cryptocurrency, the company said. \"As globalization increases, so does the demand for technological solutions and talent to solve the world's hardest financial problems, such as retail remittances,\" Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple's SVP of business operations, said in an email. The company said the initiative was launched in part because of a demand for jobs. More than 4,500 job openings with the terms \"blockchain\" or \"cryptocurrency\" were posted on LinkedIn last year, Ripple said, a 150 percent increase from a year earlier. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While there are countless uses for that technology, Ripple's focus is on real-time transaction settlements for banks. It has announced partnerships with U.S. money transfer giants MoneyGram and Western Union as well as American Express and Santander. Ripple is officially the name of the San Francisco-based company, which is developing a network for faster global financial payments. XRP is the name of the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. Some university research and projects will involve Ripple's technology and the cryptocurrency XRP but it is not a requirement, the company said. The cryptocurrency was trading near 65 cents Monday, according to CoinDesk. XRP is one of the worst performing digital currencies in 2018, down more than 70 percent year to date. Ripple owns about 60 billion of the 100 billion XRP ever made, bringing its market cap based on Monday's price and its holdings alone close to $39 billion.

The investor recommended gold as the best hedge to protect against any negative geopolitical outcomes. \"Two confrontational, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders playing chicken with each other, while the world is watching to see which one will be caught bluffing, or if there will be a hellacious war,\" Dalio wrote in August 2017 on LinkedIn. \"We can also say that if ... things go badly, it would seem that gold (more than other safe haven assets like the dollar, yen, and treasuries) would benefit.\" At the time, the hedge fund manager suggested investors allocate 5 to 10 percent of their portfolios to gold. The hedge fund manager also said it is important to be nimble and not be too concentrated during times of geopolitical uncertainty. \"When it comes to assessing political matters (especially global geopolitics like the North Korea matter), we are very humble. We know that we don't have a unique insight that we'd choose to bet on,\" he wrote last year. \"We aim to stay liquid, stay diversified, and not be overly exposed to any particular economic outcomes.\" Bridgewater is the world's largest hedge fund, managing about $160 billion, according to its website.

But in this kind of fight, history seems to indicate there are very few winners. Economists are warning about hypothetical scenarios where Trump takes it too far, and other countries strike back, inevitably sending the global trade community down a spiraling path of retaliation. That scenario played out in almost real time this week. The White House on Thursday unveiled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and European Union countries. And those countries swiftly announced they would retaliate with their own tariffs and trade actions. No one knows exactly what will unfold, but if history is any indicator, we can make a pretty good guess. There have been a number of trade battles in the last 80 years. Reagan imposed some pretty significant tariffs on Japan in the 1980s. And in the '90s, countries were agreeing to stricter rules under the World Trade Organization. More recently, former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. He was met with threats of retaliation from European trading partners. And soon after, he ended the tariffs. Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images George W. Bush But in one case, a trade war had dire global consequences. Let's take it back to the 1930s. America was turning inward with protectionist policies. The government was restricting trade with other countries. And in an effort to save U.S. factories, a couple of congressmen came up with a plan. It was formally called the Tariff Act of 1930, but it's more commonly known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The plan faced a lot of opposition, but it ultimately became law. The act raised tariffs on American imports to nearly record levels. But instead of reviving the economy, it actually exacerbated the Great Depression. Nations across the world were striking each other with tit-for-tit tariffs. European countries put a tax on American goods, which slowed trade between the U.S. and Europe. That made it harder for the U.S. to crawl out of its economic slump. Nationalist rhetoric was heating up, with countries blaming others for their struggles. All of that eventually escalated, turning a trade war into a real war when World War II began. That's why after the war ended, nations formed the World Trade Organization to regulate international trade, in the hopes that nothing like the global trade war of the 1930s would ever happen again.

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Warren Buffett told CNBC on Wednesday that it was true his Berkshire Hathaway considered investing in the privately held ride-hailing company Uber earlier this year, but he wasn't always so enthusiastic about the sharing economy. During Berkshire's 2014 annual meeting, Buffett handled a question about whether the disruptive business model used by Airbnb and Uber was here to stay and what implications that had for their sectors. \"The ones you name, I don't know anything about,\" he said in a clip found through CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive. \"I mean, I know what they do, but I don't know their specific prospects, which is why we kind of stay away from that sort of thing because we don't \u2014 we know there'll be change, and we don't know who the winners will be. And we try to stick with businesses where we know the winners.\" But a lot has changed in four years, apparently. On Wednesday, after reports came out that Berkshire had offered a $3 billion investment in Uber, Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick that while some of the details weren't correct it was true the two had talked and the discussions fell apart over terms. But, he told CNBC, \"I'm a great admirer\" of Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. For his part, Khosrowshahi told CNBC's Carl Quintanilla in an interview at the Code conference that it's always possible talks will resume. \"We are a company that has, as you know, an enormous growth trajectory but at the same time it comes with considerable risk,\" he said. \"So I don't think we necessarily fit in with the typical Warren Buffett investment. Maybe we can be a different kind of investment, a portfolio diversification play for him.\" Buffett has a history of taking big stakes in private companies or buying them outright, such as Dairy Queen and, more recently, Pilot Flying J. But the Uber investment would have been along the lines of Berkshire's financial crisis-era investment in Goldman Sachs, backing it with his reputation at a time when Wall Street banks were reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and thirsty for capital. In deals like this, Berkshire helps a company boost capital in exchange for lucrative terms allowing it to reap significant gains. In 2008, Berkshire got $5 billion of preferred shares of Goldman with warrants to buy $5 billion of stock down the road at a low strike price. It did a similar deal with Bank of America in 2011, and is now that bank's biggest shareholder. Uber has been trying to recover after cultural issues and management turnover, as well as a fatal driverless car crash. Earlier this year, it got $1.25 billion from a group led by SoftBank, which also bought shares from existing investors and employees.

The research found that social pressure to compete with one's neighbors on exciting new purchases is so great that it leads to a significant increase in both the amount of credit and mortgages people are willing to incur, the paper finds. \"We find that the magnitude of the neighbor's lottery win is related to the dollar value of more visible, but not less visible consumption assets,\" wrote Sumit Agarwal of Georgetown University and Vyacheslav Mikhed of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. \"The magnitude of lottery wins increases the value of risky financial assets (securities) on the balance sheets of nonlottery-winning neighbors at the time of bankruptcy filing,\" they added. \"On the other hand, the magnitude of the lottery win has no effect on cash and (weakly) decreases less risky assets.\" The researchers studied the effects a one-time income boost for one person on the financial stability of that person's neighbors. Limiting the sample to a collection of small neighborhoods in Canada, the researchers wrote, helped guarantee that neighbors witnessed any obvious changes in consumption by lottery winners. The one lucky winner, they reason, should be clear thanks to flashy purchases like a new car or a larger house. Among its main findings, the study observed that a lottery win equal to the median annual income for the communities studied increases the rate of bankruptcies among neighbors by 0.03 in the three years after the win, a 6.59 percent increase relative to the average bankruptcy rate. In turn, that type of \"conspicuous consumption\" pressures neighbors into spending more themselves. But while social pressures can lead to compelling academic theories, upticks riskier borrowing appeared to have more insidious economic implications. While the size of the lottery win didn't affect neighbors' credit in the years prior to a lottery win, the researchers found increases in both the number of accounts as well as the dollar balances after lottery wins, implying a net increase in borrowing in neighborhoods following an isolated income shock. In terms of magnitude, Agarwal and Mikhed found that a 10 percent increase in the lottery amount would buoy all credit accounts by 0.003 and total balances by $134 in the second year after the win. They also observed a shift in the housing market; according to their calculations, a 10 percent increase in the lottery prize would result in 0.0007 additional mortgages and an additional $165 in mortgage balances in the second year after the win. \"Taken together, these findings are suggestive of the increased borrowing of neighbors because of relative income comparisons, leading to financial distress,\" Agarwal and Mikhed wrote. \"While the results in this paper are based on microgeographies, [by] examining the very close neighbors of lottery winners, future research could possibly examine whether these results are important for the entire economy,\" they said.

When it comes to proving the tangible benefits of the blockchain technology that many expect to change the world, it is still very early days and the earliest viable applications will likely be in supply chain management, rather than financial services, executives say. In fact, Cisco stopped researching blockchain applications in financial services after 18 months because it will take a while for the many players in the complex markets to get up to speed, Anoop Nannra, head of the company's blockchain initiative, told CNBC in May. Instead, for the last year or so he said the team has been investigating blockchain applications in supply chain management. Even still, their research indicates it will be roughly 10 years before blockchain really becomes prevalent in supply chain management. For financial services, Nannra predicts somewhere from five to 25 years. \"It's anyone's guess,\" Nannra said. \"When you're trying to drive a mindset shift it's almost a generational thing.\" Expected years for widespread adoption of blockchain Source: Altman Vilandrie; Cowen and Company. Companies and governments across industries are exploring blockchain. Market intelligence firm IDC predicts global spending on blockchain solutions will more than double to $2.1 billion this year, according to a Cowen report on May 24. However, Cowen also said a survey of 23 executives and experts in the field expect on average the technology will take 5.9 years to gain widespread adoption. In theory, blockchain \u2014 often referred to as distributed-ledger technology by corporations \u2014 cuts costs and increases transaction efficiency because the technology eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology, with a focus on payments. Its price, and that of many other cryptocurrencies, skyrocketed last year as investors speculated on the potential for blockchain to change the world as much as the internet did. But by late last year it was becoming apparent to many that blockchain technology isn't necessarily the best solution in many cases. It could add complexity to existing systems. Mark Smith, CEO of blockchain development company Symbiont, said that after four years of research, the firm has found the technology works best when there's an opportunity to automate processes, such as data collection. \"I think supply chain is going to be the first, if not near the first, to really show the value of blockchain,\" Smith said. \"There aren't any regulatory questions in supply chain management that you have to deal with.\" Anatomy of a supply chain Source: Cowen IBM, the most outspoken corporation on blockchain, has announced major projects in applying the technology to global supply chains: \"Big Blue\" partnered with UBS in 2016 to improve trade financing by using blockchain to verify transactions and automatically release payments as a shipment travels from a warehouse to an airplane, truck or boat and arrives at a port. Bank of Montreal, CaixaBank, Commerzbank and Erste have since joined the project, called Batavia. In August 2017, IBM announced Walmart, Tyson Foods, grocery supply chain company McLane, Driscoll's and other major companies in the global food supply chain formed a consortium to develop a blockchain application for the industry. In January, Maersk and IBM announced plans to form a joint venture to improve efficiency in global trade by using blockchain technology to standardize data collection. IBM is in a quiet period about the venture and could not speak directly about it. \"Blockchain's really about trust in data and business processes,\" said Ramesh Gopinath, vice president of blockchain solutions at IBM. \"When you have to rely on data, four or five hops upstream, you have to have a reason to trust it and blockchain provides that.\" He said four key elements for a viable blockchain-based platform are: members, data, applications and the application programming interface for third parties. If trust is blockchain's real value, many enthusiasts say the technology will work best not as a new system within private enterprise, but in its pure form \u2014 an open-source, publicly accessible platform powered by a global network of users. In supply chain management, start-up Eximchain is looking to launch the first public platform for the industry using blockchain. The company plans to keep user transactions encrypted using Quorum, an open-source blockchain program spearheaded by J.P. Morgan. Hope Liu, formerly of UBS, co-launched Eximchain through MIT in 2015 and has raised $20 million for the company. Her immediate goal is to give millions of small and medium-sized enterprises a jump-start at gaining enough credibility through blockchain records to get better financing. Suppliers have the earliest upfront costs, but typically get paid last. Having a record of their contribution to a finished product on a blockchain could help suppliers get loans to fund new orders before getting paid for prior work. \"The longer the supply chain \u2026 the more parts, the more value,\" Liu said. \"We actually turned down some of the customers because their use case doesn't make sense [for blockchain].\" In finance, some companies have found they didn't need blockchain either. \"The return on investment for large-scale DLT solutions in highly efficient, deep and mature markets does not exist today,\" Michael Bodson, CEO of clearing and settlement giant DTCC, said in the company's 2017 annual report. \"New technology isn't always needed to drive innovation. As we demonstrated last September, the move to a T+2 settlement cycle in the U.S. was achieved using current technology,\" Bodson said. DTCC began exploring blockchain more than two years ago. But financial institutions aren't about to abandon their research in blockchain. DTCC is planning to test the technology for managing credit derivatives records. Citi and Goldman Sachs rank among the five corporations exploring and investing the most in blockchain in the six years through the first quarter of 2018, according to CB Insights. Blockchain represents \"a big change, honestly, in the financial system,\" said William D'Angelo, partner at law firm Drinker Biddle in Los Angeles. \"The people that are most worried are the banks. They're spending millions and millions of dollars to build private blockchains so they don't feel like they're shut out.\" In the meantime, far younger blockchain companies are looking for areas in finance in which the technology does make sense. Some start-ups are using the technology for cross-border payments. Five-year-old Symbiont is working with Vanguard to process some index data, and developing a blockchain platform for investment in private equity funds. Many of the blockchain projects have also decided to circumvent traditional funding routes by directly issuing digital tokens through initial coin offerings. The ICOs have raised $9.1 billion so far this year, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. But it remains to be seen whether start-ups or major corporations will be the first to unlock the full value of blockchain. \"We haven't disrupted a single industry yet with blockchain technology yet, but the industries we are disrupting are going to respond,\" said Robert Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a cryptocurrency focused on user privacy.

Profitability at parts of AK Steel remains limited, according to Goldman Sachs, despite support from President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on foreign steel. The bank downgraded shares to sell from neutral on Wednesday citing increased competition within its core automotive U.S. business . \"AK Steel shares are now trading below their level from early November 2016, having given back the gains made with the election of President Trump in November 2016, the initial run-up of the current cycle in domestic steel prices starting in November 2017, and the Department of Commerce announcement in February 2018 of more stringent-than-expected recommended Section 232 remedies,\" Goldman analyst Matthew Korn wrote Tuesday. \"Now, with our updated estimates reflecting lower forecasts for realized pricing and profitability, the risk/reward for AK Steel looks unfavorable,\" he added. Shares of AK Steel fell more than 2 percent in premarket trading following the Goldman Sachs note. Shares of the nation's major steel producers have gyrated in recent months, rising and falling on the nuances of the Trump administration's pursuit of tariffs on imports of steel. The White House's decision to push back the tariff deadline in early May, for example, sent shares of rivals U.S. Steel and Nucor down 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. Hoping to address creeping doubts over the future of the taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports \u2013 a key target of the original policy \u2013 will stay in place even as the administration suspends separate tariffs on Chinese goods. \"As it relates to China, the steel and aluminum tariffs will remain enforced,\" he said. \"Those were not part of our discussions. We were merely focused on the proposed $150 billion.\" \"Those are not being touched,\" he added. Notwithstanding the assurance from Mnuchin, AK Steel's stock price, which rallied more than 60 percent in the months immediately following President Trump's election, has tumbled back to their pre-election levels above $4. With weaker-than-expected quarterly guidance on pricing and profits, Goldman Sachs believes the stocks could sink further. Analyst Korn cut his 12-month price forecast for the company to $4 from $6, implying 9.5 percent downside from Tuesday's close.

Top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would acquire trading platform Paradex in the start-up's latest attempt to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive crypto economy. The San Francisco-based company, which landed at the No. 10 spot on the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, is also overhauling its flagship trading platform GDAX designed for professional investors. GDAX and the new product, Coinbase Pro, will exist side-by-side until June 29 when all customers will be rolled over to the newer version. Paradex will be integrated into that new product in the coming weeks, the company said. \"This will significantly enhance the proposition for our customers in terms of what they want to trade and how they want to trade it,\" Asiff Hirji, Coinbase president and chief operating officer told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. show chapters Coinbase launches new products for retail & institutional crypto investors 6:41 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 09:30 A key distinction between Paradex and other exchanges is that it does not hold tokens on behalf of its customers. Users instead trade peer-to-peer, directly from their own \"wallets.\" Coinbase in contrast, acts as a trusted custodian for digital assets on its exchange. \"This peer-to-peer trading removes the need for third-party custodianship and the associated security risks,\" Coinbase said in a blog post. \"It is another step toward creating a truly decentralized crypto economy.\" Paradex's platform offers hundreds of digital tokens for trading, while Coinbase notoriously only offers four. Initially, only customers outside of the U.S. will have access to the new exchange but Coinbase said it's \"actively working toward\" regulatory clearance for the product in the U.S. \"As soon as we can we're going to turn it on in the U.S,\" Hirji said. \"We're greatly increasing the number of things you can trade and we're doing it in a compliant way.\" Some U.S. exchanges have been cautious about listing ICO tokens because of concerns that they might be considered unregistered securities and could require platforms that list them to be licensed by regulators. In March the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors that platforms offering trading of digital assets that are securities and operate as an \"exchange\" must register with regulators. Hirji said Coinbase would like to list \"as many assets as possible,\" but despite increased discussions with regulators, the company has not gotten increased guidance. \"As soon as there is more clarity we will list them as long as they adhere to our framework,\" Hirji said. \"But clarity is needed and I don't think we're close to that unfortunately.\" Coinbase has traded $150 billion in assets for more than 20 million customers and had a reported revenue last year of $1 billion as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed. While the company is best known as the leading U.S. cryptocurrency trading platform, Coinbase has been pouring money into plans to stay ahead in a larger cryptocurrency economy. The company is looking to lure institutional investors, a group that have been especially careful when entering the volatile cryptocurrency market. Coinbase launched four new products last week: Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Markets, The Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group and Coinbase Prime to cater to the \"white glove\" investors. Like GDAX, Coinbase Pro customers will have access the single pool of liquidity shared by all Coinbase products.

He managed a fund at Legg Mason that beat the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years through 2005 before he founded Miller Value Partners in 2016. The opposite mentality has generally factored into daily market moves in recent years. Stocks fell earlier this year as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed toward 3 percent. Even on Wednesday, stocks closed higher after minutes from the latest Fed meeting said the central bank would be comfortable letting inflation temporarily run above the 2 percent target, a statement that caused yields to decline. But over the long term, Miller's analysis appears to be holding true. The S&P 500 is up more than 30 percent since the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in December 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade. Miller pointed out that: During the bull market of 1980, bond yields rose 210 basis points and the market was up 26 percent. In 1983, bond yields rose 146 basis points and the market was up 17 percent. In 1996, bond yields rose 85 basis points and the market gained 20 percent. In 2009, bond yields rose 160 basis points and the market gained 23 percent. In 2013, bond yields rose 126 basis points and the market rose 30 percent. He said the connection between higher yields and stock prices has become more complicated since the financial crisis. \"But overall, I think it looks like the market actually wants to go up.\" The S&P 500 is up more than 3 percent for the second quarter so far, and markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least two more times this year.

An official who could have a big say in whether Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. can merge is keeping an open mind. Makan Delrahim, who heads antitrust efforts for the U.S. Department of Justice, said he doesn't see reducing the number of major wireless carriers from four to three as inherently bad for the market, Bloomberg reports. \"I don't think there's any magical number that I'm smart enough to glean about any single market,\" Delrahim told reporters on Friday. Antitrust concerns are seen as one of the biggest potential hurdles for the proposed $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. The carriers control 18 percent and 14 percent, respectively of the market. Together, their market share edges out Verizon Wireless's 31 percent share and trails only AT&T's 36 percent share. Bad vibes from federal officials during the Obama administration were cited as the reason Sprint pulled back on an earlier effort to acquire T-Mobile. And while the Trump administration is seen as potentially more open to a merger, its court battle to stop an $85 billion merger of AT&T and Time Warner has given mixed signals.

The stocks of some of China's biggest companies are set to join a key global index by the close Thursday, giving ordinary U.S. investors greater access to mainland China. More than $1.9 trillion in assets is benchmarked to MSCI's Emerging Markets index, which is tracked by the EEM ETF. The index has so far excluded hard-to-access mainland Chinese-traded stocks known as A shares and only includes Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong or the U.S. But by Thursday's close, around 230 of the A shares are scheduled to be included, kicking off a process that could eventually give A shares 16 percent allocation in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and China a 42 percent weighting. \"This is a really important event that could change the face of EM investing,\" Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research for MSCI, said in a call with media Thursday morning New York time. Emerging markets includes countries such as China, India and Brazil that tend to be growing rapidly towards a developed economy. For U.S. investors looking to invest in those foreign stock markets, U.S.-traded ETFs such as BlackRock's iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) can offer access. show chapters Discussing the likely impact of China's A-share MSCI inclusion 12:38 AM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 02:10 According to MSCI's April 23 provisional index, Chinese stocks up for addition to the index include: BYD, an electric automaker that Warren Buffett has invested in; SAIC Motor, a major automaker with a joint venture with General Motors; Kweichow Moutai, manufacturer of a popular Chinese liquor with 53 percent alcohol; major Chinese oil producer PetroChina and China Construction Bank. MSCI announced Wednesday that five Chinese stocks, including ZTE, will not be added. Trading in shares of the telecom equipment giant has been halted since the U.S. in April banned American companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years. For Beijing, getting some of its mainland stocks added to a major global index is a major step towards its goal of opening up domestic markets to foreign investment. MSCI decided against adding the A shares for three years due to issues such as foreign market access and trading suspensions. Last June, the index company finally decided that China had made enough improvements, particularly by expanding a stock connect program to link Hong Kong's markets with that in Shenzhen as well as Shanghai. Due to daily trading limits on the Stock Connect program, MSCI said it will add the A shares in two phases. Thursday's A share inclusion will add just 2.5 percent of the market capitalization of the 230 A shares. Another 2.5 percent is set for addition to the index in August, raising China's weighting in the overall index by 0.8 percent to about 31 percent. That should result in $22 billion in inflows to Chinese A shares, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated in a Tuesday note. However, other estimates point to a more limited immediate impact. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in a May 15 report that Thursday's inclusion should result in just a $1.7 billion passive fund flow. The second phase of inclusion set for August should result in another $1.7 billion, the report said. The total $3 billion to $3.5 billion represents about 0.9 percent of the total free float market cap for A share markets, the analysts said. KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF (KBA), which seeks to track the A shares set for inclusion, traded more than 1 percent higher Thursday afternoon. EEM itself has struggled this year, falling about 3 percent. But it is up 10 percent over the last 12 months and has $37.7 billion in assets.

"body": " Adam Jeffery | CNBC Republicans finally managed to roll back some of the Wall Street regulations passed by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis after years of trying. While it wasn't a full repeal as some had hoped, it's the first legislative overhaul since the Dodd-Frank Act became law in 2010. This debate has primarily been framed as a fight over regulation. Democrats generally want more to protect taxpayers and investors from the next crisis; Republicans want less because they argue it stifles economic growth. More from The Conversation: The US economy is in desperate need of a strong dose of fiscal penicillin How money is destroying the world Recent stock market sell-off foreshadows a new Great Recession So who's right? Based on our combined 35 years of experience with securities markets and the research we've done for our book, \"When the Levees Break: Re-visioning Regulation of the Securities Markets,\" we think both sides are wrong. The issue isn't about more or less regulation but about the need for a streamlined system that supports 21st-century investing. If we had our way, the whole system of financial regulation would be burned to the ground and replaced with something entirely different. Of bonds and banks When we think of financial markets, we tend to jumble securities markets like stocks, bonds and commodities with conventional bank lending such as checking accounts and lines of credit. Dodd-Frank, for example, was ostensibly focused on regulation of securities markets, but the rules that got the most attention were those that affect the \"too big to fail\" banks. That those banks straddled both worlds \u2013 securities trading and traditional banking \u2013 is what made the 2008 financial crisis life-threatening. But only securities trading, and in particular derivatives, was at the root of the crisis. So for our purposes, when we talk about financial regulation, our focus is on the securities markets. How did we get here? The financial markets meltdown in the fall of 2008 devastated the U.S. economy, but it wasn't nearly as bad as the stock market rout that preceded the Great Depression in October 1929. After the 1929 crash, lawmakers reacted by passing laws aimed at ensuring investor protection. Two groundbreaking pieces of legislation, passed in 1933 and 1934, required companies to submit quarterly and annual reports and established the Securities and Exchange Commission. These laws form the cornerstone of modern securities markets regulation. But they were only the beginning. As markets expanded and changed, Congress continued to craft new laws that added more agencies to oversee Wall Street activities. As a result, we have more than two dozen agencies, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges \u2013 such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Justice Department \u2013 not to mention state securities agencies, all with overlapping regulatory jurisdictions. Moreover, the laws have been reactionary \u2013 rather than visionary \u2013 resulting in competing concerns and duplicative audit and enforcement procedures. Not surprisingly, there is largely no coordination or communication between them. Meanwhile, the SEC \u2013 as primary regulator \u2013 is bogged down with too many directives, many of which are under- or unfunded. For decades, whenever Congress passed a bill to \"regulate\" big changes in the markets \u2013 from market crashes to \"advancements\" such as mutual funds and investment advisers \u2013 the SEC has been required to add oversight of these new practices to their existing responsibilities. Dodd-Frank, for example, expanded the SEC's role and called for additional internal audits of existing practices but \u2013 like past market-related legislation \u2013 failed to include funding for those activities. Amid all the regulation, investor protection seems to have gotten lost. Enter Dodd-Frank The severity of the 2008 crash and its economic impact \u2013 including investment company failures and unprecedented government bailouts \u2013 goaded Congress into action. In 2010 Democratic lawmakers passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the most extensive revision of securities regulation since the 1930s, with the hope that more regulation would prevent another crisis. Republicans have argued for its repeal ever since, claiming the law and the regulations designed to implement it \u2013 some of which have yet to be implemented \u2013 inhibit prosperity. Both parties are missing the point. The current system of financial regulation is built on how stocks were traded in the 1930s \u2013 when computers and algorithmic trading had yet to be a glimmer in a quant's eye. To paraphrase an Oldsmobile commercial, it's not your father's stock market anymore. My, how markets have changed Financial markets have undergone a fundamental transformation over the past 80 years. First of all, there are the investors themselves. The mom and pop investor who the SEC was created to protect has by and large been replaced by institutional investors, including quantitative analysts, or \"quants,\" that use complex algorithmic formulas to predict the best trading strategies. In fact, algorithmic trading makes up the majority of volume in today's markets. Then there's the issue of disclosure. Since the dawn of federal securities regulation, lawmakers and regulators have relied on disclosure to protect investors. Public companies are required to disclose volumes of information, from financial information to dealings with Iran and even their code of ethics. As a result, a company can spend over a million dollars each year complying with disclosure regulations that few people actually read. Yet every time there's a new disaster, Congress piles on the disclosure requirements, as happened with Dodd-Frank. But for all the hundreds of pages of disclosure, at no time in the past 80 years has there been a mandate to review the actual securities products issued by public companies and investment banks. There are no \"safety\" standards for stocks, like there are for cars or toasters. The products that brought down the house in 2008 \u2013 mortgage-backed securities and products derived from them \u2013 continue to be offered to the public, including new ones backed by credit card debt and student loans. Finally, the SEC and other regulators are unequipped to keep up with the breathtaking changes in technology, let alone anticipate potential advances and challenges. To understand why, one must only consider the breadth of organizations that have fallen victim to hackers, from Target and Yahoo to the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Reserve itself. Unfortunately, however, Congress does not fund the SEC in a way that would allow it to pay for the skills or systems it needs to keep up with technological and other market advances. Following Dodd-Frank, for example, the SEC's budget was actually reduced, even as its responsibilities multiplied. In sum, what we have is a regulatory system that fails in its mission to protect investors. The structure used to oversee current investment practices, corporate disclosures, product development and technological advances is based on the market failures of 1929. It's a bit like trying to surf the internet using a typewriter. Preparing for the next crash The next \"big\" crash will likely be bigger than the last one. So how do we prepare for it? What we've done so far won't protect us in the future. Dodd-Frank is largely an extension of the existing patchwork structure. While the new legislation won't make things worse \u2013 as it's targeting small and mid-sized banks \u2013 Republican hopes to repeal the rest of it and return banks to the pre-crisis period of self-regulation would. After the next crash, institutions will not be too big to fail, they'll be too big to save. The answer, in our view, is to move away from a fight about how much regulation toward a complete rethinking of how we regulate investing. Only then will the U.S. begin to prepare for the next big one.

One of the more hawkish central bankers when it comes to monetary policy, Harker said he envisions a scenario where the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark overnight rate three times total in 2018 and three more times next year, then stops as the economy hits equilibrium. \"I think we're getting close to neutral,\" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas. \"If we see inflation start to accelerate, then I would be open to a fourth increase this year. But I'd have to see evidence of that first.\" The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, of which Harker is a nonvoting member this year, approved a quarter-point rate hike in March and is widely expected to add another in June and one more in September. Whether the committee approves a fourth rate rise in December remains an open question, with traders currently assigning it a 39 percent chance. Policy doves, who favor lower rates, seemed to get a boost Wednesday, when minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting indicated that officials would be willing to let inflation run above the Fed's 2 percent target for a temporary period. Harker said he, too, would consider that, though it would depend on conditions. \"I don't think of it so much as a number around 2 percent, although that's part of it,\" he said during the \"Power Lunch\" interview. \"It's the acceleration or deceleration. If we're creeping up to 2 percent and we creep up to, say, 2.25 percent, that's a different story than [if] we're accelerating past 2 percent. I think we'd behave differently. At least I would as a policymaker.\" Fed officials were in Dallas for a conference on technology and disruption.

The earnings growth will have to slow because the year-over-year comps get so tough,\" he told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" on Thursday. \"When you've got slower earnings growth and higher interest rates, that's going to knock down equity valuations.\" It's a scenario that's already unfolding. \"It's not strong, but it's broad-based. We're seeing it in things like higher oil prices and higher gas prices where oil is up 50 percent year over year. Gas is up 20 percent year over year. We're seeing it all throughout wages,\" he said. Despite his cautious outlook for next year, Zidle believes it's way too premature for investors to head into the bear camp \u2014 saying that the \"tug-of-war\" between macro headwinds such as North Korea tensions and fundamentals will end favorably for stocks by summer. \"When you're lifting up the hood on the earnings story, it really tells you they're quite healthy. So, I think the fundamentals are going to ultimately win out here,\" said Zidle. \"I'm optimistic. I think the second half is actually going to be a very good environment for equities.\" He has a 3,000 year-end forecast on the S&P 500, about a 10 percent increase from current levels. According to Zidle, energy, materials, industrials and emerging markets will lead the markets back into record territory. But Zidle pointed out that many investors are sabotaging themselves right now by abandoning overweight positions in stocks in favor of fixed income, an area of the markets often seemed safer when there's fear of an economic slowdown. \"Investors are overweight fixed income, and they're intermediate to long-term durations. So, they're not positioned for that rise in rates,\" Zidle said. \"They are taking duration risk at a time when they ought to be very short duration and taking credit risk.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

AT&T attempted to acquire T-Mobile in 2011 but backed down after the Department of Justice sued to block the deal. AT&T paid T-Mobile a breakup fee that Deutsche Telekom, which owns the majority of T-Mobile, valued at $6 billion in cash and wireless spectrum, when the deal failed. Since then, cable companies have begun to enter the wireless market, including CNBC parent company Comcast.

The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is a long-held measure of volatility and fear in the marketplace illustrated by way of S&P 500stock options prices. The index is sometimes referred to as the market's \"fear gauge.\" But Stutland told CNBC that bitcoin is just as good of an indicator. \"There is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, that is starting to measure out credit risk in the market,\" Stutland said. \"That's what cryptocurrency is becoming. It's becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.\" Stutland said that makes sense considering cryptocurrency is still an unregulated way for investors to transfer capital. \"Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets,\" he said. \"Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.\" And investors are more likely to be cautious with their money when banks have increased credit risks, Stutland said. \"As credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market,\" he said. The VIX shot up to highs of 18.39 Tuesday, from Friday's lows of 12.59. The market also had a turbulent day Tuesday.

A former executive at State Street is set to face trial on U.S. charges that he participated in a scheme to defraud the bank's clients by charging them secret commissions on billions of dollars in trades. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in Boston in the case of Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president at the bank accused of committing securities fraud and wire fraud. McLellan is one four former employees of the Boston-based bank who have since 2016 faced charges by the U.S. Justice Department that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. Two of those former executives \u2014 Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt \u2014 pleaded guilty last year and are expected to testify at trial, according to court papers. McLellan, 46, has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. In January 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. According to prosecutors, McLellan, Pennings, Boomgaardt, and others from 2010 to 2011 conspired to add the secret commissions for trades performed for the six clients, which had been utilizing bank's \"transition management\" business. That service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments. The six clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund and Irish and British government pension funds, according to court papers. Prosecutors say that McLellan also participated in a separate scheme to apply hidden fees to fixed-income trades conducted for funds advised by a New York-based insurer, resulting in about $700,000 in overcharges.

Bittrex, a Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange, has struck an agreement that allows investors to buy digital coins with American dollars. In the past, only coins traded on Coinbase, a digital currency exchange in California, could be bought with dollars. That is a fraction of the approximately 1500 digital coins floating around the universe of cryptocurrenices. To buy any of the other coins, investors had to convert their money to bitcoin first. Now they have Bittrex. Founder and CEO Bill Shihara told CNBC that the goal is to \"expand out to as many markets as possible on Bittrex,\" he said on \"Fast Money\" Friday. \"As well as expand it so that every customer on Bittrex will be able to have access to U.S. dollar trading,\" he said. The exchange might even help move the market. Since so many alt coins could only be purchased by way of bitcoin, the value of bitcoin and many other digital currencies were closely correlated. The value of those crypto units may now begin to decouple from bitcoin, Shihara said, as more investors transact in dollars. Currently, nearly 200 different digital coins can be traded on Bittrex. The CEO said that a \"small, select number of launch partners\" are working with the exchange to pay in dollars. \"In this phase, we're stress-testing our system,\" he said. \"We're working with the banks very closely to ensure that they can process the FIAT deposits and withdrawals. Also, the engine itself that we use to trade, is going to be able to properly handle the load.\" Cryptocurrency is still largely unregulated in the United States, which has led many financial institutions and investors to be cautious of the coins, amid a landscape of widespread fraud and fake ICOs. Other traders have sought out foreign markets to invest in digital assets like bitcoin. But Shihara said working with U.S. regulatory agencies on better ways to use cryptocurrency will add value to the space. \"We think that solving the regulatory puzzle in the United States really unlocks a lot of capital that really can't trade on a foreign exchange that doesn't have proper [anti-money laundering] controls or proper compliance,\" Shihara said.

U.S. ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has been in Washington for a months-long effort to arrange a formal meeting between the two leaders, the publication said, citing a senior administration official. The purpose of a summit would be to resolve thorny issues between the two nations, the report said. Syria, Ukraine and nuclear-arms control are among expected discussion topics, the publication added. In 2017, Trump and Putin met twice on the sidelines of international meetings. Although Trump has been criticized frequently for not aggressively confronting Putin, Moscow and Washington have differed sharply on a range of issues \u2014 most recently the U.S.-led strike on Syria for its suspected chemical attack on civilians. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Saturday. The discussions are taking place against the backdrop of a probe by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director.

Jose Manuel Barroso, now non-executive chairman at Goldman Sachs International, told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that Beijing is getting on with development in AI. \"The Chinese are not only making statements, they are investing money,\" he said at the AI Deep Dive in partnership with Feedzai at Money2020. Barroso added that his sentiment was not negative toward China and that, in the main, Chinese-led science would benefit the world. The Goldman employee said Europe, in particular, \"should not be naive\" and must defend itself by ensuring that more money is committed to AI development. He said there was evidence that this was happening with European countries that are net contributors to Brussels being asked to provide 100 billion euros ($117 billion) over the next seven years to scientific research. Barroso said Goldman Sachs itself was heavily increasing investment in AI and, at times, it felt like there were more software engineers than financiers within the company. On data privacy, Barroso said a \"revolution\" was going on after the Facebook data scandal and that stronger regulation was set to come in globally. Alongside London-based elections consultancy Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is at the center of an ongoing dispute over the alleged harvesting and use of personal data. \"I don't believe that our democracies will accept their private data not to be protected,\" Barroso said.

The price of the S&P 500 component fell 41.8 percent Monday, down $37.78 from Friday's closing price above $90. Nektar's market cap, which was over $15 billion by Friday's close, was reduced to roughly $9 billion by the end of the session. The drop in stock price was the company's worst one-day fall ever. The precipitous fall came after data released Saturday suggested that patients diagnosed with melanoma aren't reacting to the company's experimental treatment as well as earlier samples did. The prior data, released last year, was in part responsible for the company's rally to all-time highs in the first half of 2018.

It's time for investors to go long shares of Macy's because classic brands and retailers have finally innovated their way into the digital era, according to Evercore ISI. Analyst Omar Saad, who double-upgraded his rating on shares of the iconic department store to long from short, says Wall Street's fears about a \"retailpocalypse\" stemming from Amazon's ascent are overblown. \"In a nutshell, we are convinced that old-world brands and retailers are figuring out how to manage inventory and market to consumers in the digital era, a critical turning point for the sector,\" Saad said in a note Sunday. \"Macy's and others will have equal opportunity in the coming years to compete for the attention of discretionary consumers given a core set of competitive advantages that are not going away.\" \"Multi-year share price underperformance and still modest valuations despite a very healthy consumer macro environment tell us that the market is still married to the sensational 'retailpocalypse' narrative which assumes that Amazon and other digital disruptors will continue unabated,\" he added.

The analyst raised his 2018 earnings per share estimate to $3.15 from $2.95 and his 2019 estimate to $3.40 from $3.10. Shares of Macy's rose 4.3 percent Monday following Saad's bullish note, adding to a 47 percent climb so far this year. Macy's said it acquired New York-based concept shop Story earlier this month in one of its latest attempts to develop brands that resonate with customers. The add-on has worked with brands like Jet.com and Dressbarn to curate rotating shopping experiences, with themes ranging from \"well being\" to \"made in America.\" The department store also rolled out a pop-up marketplace earlier this year to select locations, designed to bring Macy's closer to young brands looking to grow as well as provide the company with ways to offset unprofitable square footage. These types of initiatives, Saad argued, are key to an ongoing evolution in softline retailers across the country. \"A centralized pool of inventory will enable Macy's to service the same (if not more) demand with less inventory, an incredibly healthy dynamic. In recent years, Macy's has been implementing processes to improve inventory flow and management,\" he wrote. \"These efforts are just starting to pay off, with inventory continuing to decline over the past year while retail gross margins held relatively steady and finally inflected to positive in the first quarter of 2018.\" Disclaimer WATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become show chapters Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become 9:00 AM ET Sat, 14 April 2018 | 03:56 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/22/105223301-GettyImages-530665640.jpg?v=1526988235", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "Getty Images Pedestrians"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "FAC", "term": "Herald Square"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Evercore ISI"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Omar Saad"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Saad"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Sunday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the coming years"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Multi-year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Brick"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "17"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Access"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Saad"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "3.15"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "2.95"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2019"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "3.40"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "3.10"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "4.3 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Saad"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "47 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "earlier this month"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Jet.com"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Dressbarn"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "America"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "earlier this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Saad"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "recent years"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Macy"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the first quarter of 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Disclaimer WATCH"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "9:00 AM ET Sat"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "14 April 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "03:56"}], "description": "Evercore double-upgraded its rating on shares of Macy's to long from short, adding that fears of a \"retailpocalypse\" at the hands of Amazon are overblown.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/the-retailpocalypse-is-over-and-its-time-to-go-long-macys-evercore-isi-says.html", "author": "Getty Images", "title": "The 'retailpocalypse' is over and it's time to go long Macy's, Evercore ISI says"}, {"time": "2018-05-29T19:00:49-0400", "body": " Mike Segar | Reuters Digital display signs on the exterior of the headquarters of Morgan Stanley in New York's Times Square. Morgan Stanley shares dropped 5.7 percent on Tuesday amid a broad decline in bank stocks and after an executive cited more challenging business conditions in the second quarter for its wealth management division, which contributes about half of the bank's revenue. The stock drop is the deepest in almost two years and made Morgan Stanley the worst-performing of the big U.S. banks on an already down day for stocks. The KBW Bank index fell 3.9 percent amid concerns around European countries, including Italy and Spain. The firm is seeing \"obvious headwinds\" in transaction revenue among retail clients as activity slowed in March and remained slower through April and May, Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, said Tuesday in a New York conference. Saperstein also cited relatively low pricing on fee-based accounts. Those accounts are pegged to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter, when the market was swooning. Morgan Stanley will spend more on interest expense than before as it diversifies its deposit sources, slowing the growth of net interest income, Saperstein said.

For analysts with a long-term view, that price action fits with their thesis that increased scrutiny will shake out the bad actors and make the markets healthy enough for institutions to invest. \"In the long run this is WILDLY bullish,\" Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and head of BKCM, said in a note to clients Thursday. \"If the DoJ and CFTC feel as though they have 'cleaned' up the market, then it paves the way for a U.S. Physically backed Bitcoin ETF, and brings in institutional investors.\" Bitcoin briefly hit a six-week low of $7,272 on Thursday morning after Bloomberg reported the U.S. Department of Justice opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies. The report, citing sources, said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was assisting in the investigation. However, bitcoin soon recovered its losses for the day and was trading near $7,570 in the afternoon, down just 8 percent since Friday. The CFTC, which oversees bitcoin futures, declined to comment, as did the Justice Department. \"I have not seen any evidence of price manipulation in bitcoin markets, but am certainly in favor of increased oversight, as it can only help to instill further confidence in the crypto markets,\" said Joe DiPasquale, founder and CEO of BitBull Capital, a cryptofund that invests in other cryptofunds. show chapters Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin 8:40 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 07:38 Other negative news could have hit bitcoin's price harder this week, but did not. On Monday, the North American Securities Administrators Association announced that an \"Operation Cryptosweep\" crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud has resulted in nearly 70 inquiries and investigations nationwide since the beginning of this month. Thirty-five enforcement actions are pending or completed. \"These actions signal that 'adult supervision' is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for the crypto-currency investor,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a Thursday report. Lee maintained his midyear price target of $20,000 on bitcoin and a year-end forecast of $25,000. That said, it may take longer for the cryptocurrency market to recover from the regulatory uncertainty that has contributed to bitcoin's more than 50 percent plunge at the start of this year. Lee had predicted bitcoin would get a boost last week from Consensus and other cryptocurrency conferences during New York City's \"Blockchain Week.\" But the regulatory overhang persisted. On the Friday heading into the week of conferences, bitcoin fell to its lowest since April 20, a three-week low, after news prosecutors raided the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. \"The crypto market is still in its infancy \u2014 we are in the stone ages comparatively \u2014 and very sensitive to news and manipulation,\" said Matthew Roszak, co-founder of blockchain company Bloq and chairman of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. \"As the market matures with better infrastructure (exchanges, futures, etc.) along with increased participation from global institutional investors,\" he said, \"the market will get past these growing pains.\" WATCH: DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe show chapters DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe 8:39 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 03:41 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/18/105217570-blockchain.jpg?v=1533336284", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": " Chesnot | Getty Images Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this week"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "WILDLY"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "\" Brian Kelly"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BKCM"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "DoJ"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CFTC"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin ETF"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "six-week"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "7,272"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "morning"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bloomberg"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the U.S. Department of Justice"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the day"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "7,570"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "the afternoon"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "just 8 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CFTC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Justice Department"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Joe DiPasquale"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "BitBull Capital"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:40 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "24"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "07:38 Other negative news"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this week"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "nearly 70"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the beginning of this month"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "Thirty-five"}, {"category": "NORP", "term": "Fundstrat"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tom Lee"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Lee"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "midyear"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "year-end"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "25,000"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 50 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the start of this year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Lee"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Consensus"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "New York City's"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Blockchain Week"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the week"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "April 20"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "three-week"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "South Korea"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Matthew Roszak"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Chamber of Digital Commerce"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "DOJ"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "8:39 PM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "24"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Bitcoin has held up relatively well this week despite negative headlines about regulatory crackdowns.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/bitcoin-tracking-for-slight-weekly-losses-despite-regulatory-crackdown.html", "author": "Chesnot | Getty Images", "title": "Bitcoin tracking for slight weekly losses despite news of regulatory crackdowns"}, {"time": "2018-05-28T03:00:19-0400", "body": " Christian Hartmann | Reuters The Swiss Re building in Zurich is shown in this Feb. 19, 2009 photo.

The digital currency's increased number of use cases is proof that the popular form of money is being institutionalized. \"Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,\" Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Friday. \"Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk,\" he added. \"A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive,\" he said.

On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again \u2014 this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400. Regardless, Bogart said it's still a buy. In fact, he said it's the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream. Many of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\" Bogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO. \"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart said. \"They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\" Alternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as \"neutral\" \u2014 and he told investors to hold for now. Bogart said he's especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don't work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on. Bitcoin, however, should \"at least\" end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind. \"But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,\" he said of bitcoin increasing value. \"Could bitcoin trade lower?

It was after hours, and Silvergate's exhibit booth had closed for the day. The man, one of thousands of people who paid $2,000 for access to the conference, had seemingly broken a sweat tracking down the unassuming booth in search of the man known for bankrolling cryptocurrency start-ups: Silvergate Bank CEO Alan Lane. He noticed Lane's stray card sitting on the table, and lit up. \"This is exactly what I need.\" Google Earth Silvergate Bank in La Jolla, California. San Diego-based Silvergate is a 30-year-old community bank with three branches in southern California. Yet, it has become known as a lifeline for cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that had their accounts closed or were turned down by Wall Street banks wary of an emerging asset with potential ties to money laundering. Even Warren Buffett has expressed his skepticism about bitcoin, calling it \"rat poison.\" Undeterred, Lane is one of the most aggressive executives in cryptocurrencies. Alongside the recent surge of interest in bitcoin and its rivals, Silvergate doubled its assets to $1.9 billion last year. The bank now has more than 250 international clients in the industry, drawing new customers by acting more like a 24/7 clearinghouse for cryptocurrency exchanges. On the surface, the 56- year-old seems much more like a college professor, or a priest, than a wheeling-and-dealing bank executive. During a recent interview, Lane took off his glasses before answering a question he has clearly been asked before: Why would you bet this small bank's reputation on one of the biggest headline risks of the past five years? The grandfather of 21, and devout Catholic, said he became interested in cryptocurrency in 2013. At the time, he had been reading about bitcoin and how it might disrupt banking, an industry he had grown to love and started working in when he was a student at San Diego State University. Because of what's known as \"distributed ledger\" technology, people could theoretically become their own banks, without the need for third parties, he found out. \"I thought \"uh oh, what am I gonna do?\" Lane said with a laugh. The first thing he did was buy some. In his research, he also learned that companies trading bitcoin were being turned down left and right by other banks. \"I put two and two together and I thought, well it might disrupt banking long-term but in the short-term these companies need banks,\" he said. \"They're not doing anything wrong. They're not doing anything illegal or immoral. If they were we wouldn't be banking them.\" Embracing crypto Five years ago, when bitcoin was still at the fringes of mainstream awareness, Silvergate invited in young crypto exchanges and asked them what problems they were trying to solve and how the bank could be helpful. In order to do business with them as a state chartered bank, Silvergate needed the California State Banking Department on board as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In the summer of 2014, they brought the two regulators in and put on a presentation on bitcoin. \"That open communication with the regulators early on has proven to be really foundational,\" Lane said. \"We're very collaborative with the regulators, we ask them if they have suggestions, and what we can do better.\" Silvergate has a track record of timely reinvention. The bank was founded as a thrift in 1988. Less than a decade later, current Chairman Dennis Frank, an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, reorganized it into a bank. Frank had left Wall Street during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s to buy up failed thrifts through Houston's Coastal Banc. After selling Coastal in 2004, he moved on to California, where he would recruit investors from his Goldman days to invest in, and re-capitalize Silvergate in 1996. Under Frank's leadership, Silvergate stopped its mortgage operations in 2005 before the subprime meltdown. And when the 2008 financial crisis hit, the bank was in a solid position to lend as many other banks were paralyzed by bad mortgages on their balance sheets. That's when Frank asked Lane to come in as CEO. By then, Lane had worked his way up in the industry through several executive positions: CFO of Independence One Bank, CEO of Business Bank of California and president of Southwest Community Bancorp. Lane also had a two-year stint as a professor and co-founder John Paul the Great Catholic University in San Diego. Lane recalled Frank telling him, \"I'm a Wall Street guy and I need a banker as a partner, would you join me?\" Silvergate's ability to stay profitable during the financial crisis meant it had no shortage of lending opportunities, Lane said, but the problem was getting enough customer deposits to fund those loans. Silvergate looked to cryptocurrency companies to fill that gap. Major Silvergate clients include the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange, Paxos, bitFlyer and Kraken. David Ripley, COO of Kraken, said in an email, \"For the most part, the larger banks in the U.S. have stayed away from banking cryptocurrency businesses. In the U.S. and particularly Europe, we see smaller, more technologically advanced banks partnering with cryptocurrency businesses.\" About half of the bank's shareholders are betting that crypto is the way to go, too. They and some other investors contributed to $114 million in order to expand Silvergate's cryptocurrency businesses. Lane said the investors were drawn in as a way to invest in cryptocurrency without looking for the next new token. \"We've got institutional investors who traditionally invest in banks, and they just liked this strategy,\" Lane said. \"They're looking to get exposure in the asset class via something they understand.\" Working with cryptocurrency companies Silvergate's willingness to work with cryptocurrency companies is key to the growth of the digital asset industry overall. \"One of the ways governments had tried to make digital currency exchanges harder to operate is to cut off their banking relationships,\" said Travis Scher, Digital Currency Group's vice president of Investments. \"It hasn't always been easy for them to secure [a banking relationship].\" Run by cryptocurrency enthusiast Barry Silbert, Digital Currency Group participated in Silvergate's latest funding round and invests in about 20 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its subsidiary, CoinDesk, was the host of the Consensus conference. Wall Street banks have been hesitant to take on bitcoin-related clients, and many have banned customers from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrency. Barclays in the U.K. is among the few large banks to offer banking services in the space, and is working with start-ups Coinbase and Circle. Goldman is an investor in Circle. Apart from money laundering concerns, the crypto market was simply too small for most big banks to notice. Until last year, when bitcoin neared the $20,000 mark, the industry was a blip on the radar of regulators and most investors. Silvergate \"saw this opportunity when others didn't, to start banking the cryptocurrency companies in the space,\" Digital Currency Group's Scher said. \"The bigger banks didn't want to do this.\" Hesitance from others on Wall Street has opened up the doors for other small regional banks. They include Metropolitan Bank and Cross River Bank in Fort Lee, N.J., which are also working with cryptocurrency companies, according to people familiar with the banks. A new payment network But Silvergate appears to have an edge because of how it is using its network of cryptocurrency clients. Rather than just providing a place to store money, the bank has become somewhat of a clearinghouse, facilitating real-time transactions that can otherwise take days. \"Being able to move the payments efficiently is probably one of the biggest things holding back the space,\" said Chad Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, which owns cryptocurrency exchange itBit. \"One of the difficult issues is not actually moving crypto assets. Moving the payments is the hard part.\" Silvergate customers can transfer U.S. dollars to other Silvergate bank accounts in what's known as the Silvergate Exchange Network. This network effect helped the bank double its customer base in the first quarter through word of mouth, the CEO said. If a Silvergate customer wants to do business with someone who doesn't have a Silvergate account, they have to initiate a wire or ACH transfer, which can take longer. \"The primary benefit people see when they're signing up with us is the ability to participate in the Silvergate Exchange Network,\" Lane said. \"It becomes really powerful and our clients are the ones reaching out to others saying are you on the network? Are you a client of Silvergate?\" Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency marketplace in the U.S., did not dispute a report it is working with the bank. Previously, Coinbase was cut loose twice by Silicon Valley Bank, according to Mark Williams, a Boston University professor and a former Federal Reserve Bank examiner. \"Silvergate appears to be the only bank in town willing to sign up cryptocurrency firms whose business attracts those customers who value the privacy such products can provide,\" Williams said. \"Considering that Silvergate Bank only received Federal Reserve Bank member status in 2012, its level of asset growth is remarkable.\" Expansion plans While Silvergate has benefited from the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies, the bank has not been immune to more questionable issues that have arisen at the same time. In their five years in the space, Lane said the bank had to exit a \"handful\" of relationships with cryptocurrency companies because of compliance issues. To ensure quality clients, Lane said they heavily vet companies to make sure they don't invest in the next fraud. \"There's always going to be an element that's out of our control. Our hope is that we're doing things right on the front end, so that we're not letting in bad actors, so to speak. Not letting them in through the front door,\" he said. This year, Silvergate plans to more than double its fintech team, which includes compliance, from about 15 people to 40 people, or 20 percent of the total employee count. The bank also mitigates much of its financial risk by the amount of cash Silvergate has sitting in its accounts, according to Bert Ely, a financial institutions and monetary policy consultant. \"They obviously have very substantial customers that are keeping very big balances in these accounts,\" he said. Because it's so cash-heavy, \"Silvergate has sufficient liquid assets to handle a very substantial outflow.\" Regardless of the risks, Silvergate and its customers are in the new asset class for the long haul, betting on an influx of institutional funds that will send cryptocurrency prices climbing again. Even as bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices lost more than half their value in the first quarter, Lane said the number of Silvergate clients more than doubled. Institutional clients are generally less \"fickle\" and reactive than some retail investors, he said. \"When the prices stabilize or go down we don't see a bunch of money leaving the bank,\" Lane said. \"They're sitting there, waiting for next opportunity.\" ", "urlToImage":

the guard of honour at Chigi palace in Rome, Italy, June 1, 2018. J.P. Morgan is selling European stocks and buying American ones in the wake of Italy's political crisis. \"The weaker Euro helps Eurozone, but the global investor flows are likely to stay on the sidelines as Italy will remain an issue in the background, with the new populist government being potentially quite confrontational,\" Europe-based global equity strategist Mislav Matejka and his team said in a Monday report. They reduced their rating on euro zone stocks to neutral, from overweight, in a global regional portfolio, and moved the funds to the U.S., raising their allocation to overweight from neutral. show chapters It's really 'smart' to worry about Europe, says chief strategist. Here's why 8:35 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 03:27 On Friday, Italy swore a populist coalition into power, bringing some closure to political turmoil that hit global markets last week. Earlier in the week, the euro dropped to a low of $1.1506, its lowest since July 2017. The STOXX Europe 600 index fell 1.07 percent last week for a second straight week of declines. \"Within Eurozone, Italy was our top pick in '17 and entering '18, but in early May we closed this call, and called to recycle the profits into Germany. We reduce our year end targets for Eurozone by 5%, following the downgrade in GDP forecasts for the year,\" Matejka said. He added that likely delays in monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank also do not help euro zone stocks, which tend to fall into the \"value\" category of stocks that benefit more from higher yields. J.P. Morgan still sees about 12 percent gains ahead this year from Thursday's close for MSCI Eurozone and 8 percent for MSCI Europe. The bank's head of U.S. equity strategy, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, has a year-end price target of 3,000 for the S&P 500, a roughly 11 percent gain from Thursday's close. The forecast is the median of targets in CNBC's Strategist Survey. The \"S&P 500 posted solid gains every time yields rebounded, except during the Fed taper tantrum episode of May '13,\" Matejka said in Tuesday's report. \"The stocks - bonds correlation remains negative, which acts as an automatic valuation cushion in case of equity falls.\" J.P. Morgan expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times this year. Further growth in corporate earnings also should help U.S. stocks, Matejka said. The strategist is also overweight Japan but neutral on emerging markets until a better buying opportunity appears. \"We worry that EM might struggle if the USD firms, if Fed surprises on the upside, if the US political agenda moves strongly anti-trade or if China activity slows,\" he said. \"Also, we believe that Asian Tech might consolidate its dramatic outperformance as it is expensively priced.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/04/105249004-RTX675YT.jpg?v=1528120537", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Alessandro Bianchi"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Reuters"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Italy"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Giuseppe"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Chigi"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Rome"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Italy"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "June 1, 2018"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "J.P.

So now is a good time to buy. \"All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,\" said Morehead, who serves as CEO and co-chief investment officer of Pantera. As a whole, cryptocurrencies have declined about 65 percent from their highs this year, he said. \"It's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,\" Morehead said Thursday on \"Fast Money.\" Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, reached highs of $19,500 last December, only to dip below $6,000 in February. On Thursday evening at 5:30 p.m. ET, bitcoin was priced around $7,500. The volatile nature of all cryptocurrencies has left market watchers on edge amid looming regulatory concerns. Cryptocurrency is still a largely unregulated industry. But this might work in investors' favor, Morehead said. \"Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,\" he said. \"Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we're hearing about come online, they'll already have their positions.\" His tip for investors: Buy a currency once it breaks its 230-day moving average, wait a year and sell. \"Without even thinking about it,\" Morehead said, \"you make an average of 239 percent.\" The trader said this strategy is best illustrated in bitcoin, a coin in which it \"happened about five times in the last six years,\" he said. \"That's the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average,\" Morehead said. \"So today is a good day to be buying.\" Pantera Capital Management, which Morehead founded in 2013, is one of the first U.S. bitcoin firms. The company owns about 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including XRP, ethereum and bitcoin.

Workers transport imported soybeans at a port in Nantong, China April 9, 2018. The U.S. soybean industry is on edge again as relations with China have turned south. The Trump administration is trying to get Beijing to commit to multi-year purchase agreements, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with both sides of the matter. Those goods include U.S. soybeans, beef and poultry, the report said. But Chinese officials have been reluctant to commit, the sources told the newspaper. \"We don't expect these talks to be that fruitful,\" John Ferguson, director of global forecasting at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC. \"We expect the U.S. and China to move forward with the tariffs. For the U.S. agriculture sector, that means soybeans.\" A U.S. team is in Beijing for trade talks ahead of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' planned arrival in the city on Saturday. Members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies are involved in the discussions with China, which in 2017 was the second-largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, according to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. In early April, China's Ministry of Commerce put soybeans on its list of planned tariffs in retaliation against proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. After a pause in the trade dispute in late May, the Trump administration said Tuesday it would move forward with releasing a list of Chinese goods that will be subject to 25 percent tariffs. \"The Chinese side has confidence, capability and experience to defend the interests of our country and her people,\" the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Wednesday. \"We urge the U.S. to act in the spirits of the joint statement.\" Hopes were lifted about two weeks ago when the U.S. and China said they \"agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports.\" That week, soybean futures recovered from their lowest in more than a month to settle at their highest in three weeks. Prices have since fallen about 3 percent and were trading little changed Friday afternoon near $10.22 a bushel. On the other hand, shares of U.S. farm equipment manufacturer Deere climbed more than 2.5 percent amid broad stock market gains. \"We're confused right now,\" said Bret Davis, partner at Davis Farms in Ohio and a member of the governing board of the American Soybeans Association. I \"hope it's still a way to bring [Beijing] to the table, but still very anxious as a soybean farmer.\" In a report Thursday, the USDA Economic Research Service said that due to slower U.S. soybean exports to China, the agency expects overall exports of the crop will fall $100 million to $21.9 billion for fiscal year 2018.

Bitcoin prices have struggled this year, along with the cryptocurrency's ability to capture interest on the internet. Searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have dropped more than 75 percent since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months, according to research from Google Trends. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, pegged waning searches as a bad sign for prices. \"We use Google Trends to track search queries for 'bitcoin' as a proxy for potential new buyers,\" Colas said in an email to clients Monday. \"Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.\" Google Trends uses numbers to represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. As of January 1, bitcoin's popularity was 37 and fell to a 9 as of June 2. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":480,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-8tiab\"),window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"8tiab\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Colas also uses wallet growth as a proxy for interest, and said even small demand is a determinant for bitcoin prices. Wallets store the public and private keys which can be used to trade, or receive cryptocurrencies. Growth in new wallets was roughly 2 percent in both April and May, and first-quarter compounded monthly wallet growth was 3.7 percent this year, Colas said. But for the last quarter of 2017 when bitcoin prices were nearing $20,000, wallet growth compounded monthly was 7.6 percent. \"The comparisons between the 2017 back half comps (excellent) and 2018-to-date (poor) are stark and explain essentially all of bitcoin's fall from grace this year,\" Colas said. \"Simply put, history shows bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5%/month to see meaningful price appreciation.\" Bitcoin prices have dropped by roughly 50 percent this year, trading just below $7,500 Monday, according to CoinDesk. The world's first and largest cryptocurrency surged more than 1,300 percent last year, nearing $20,000 in December. \"This dog will have its day, but today isn't it,\" Colas said. \"While we love the idea of bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.\" Google searches for most other top cryptocurrencies has also cratered. For ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, searches are down 70 percent this year. XRP searches have fallen even more sharply, down 87 percent since January 1. Searches for the fourth largest digital currency, bitcoin cash are down 82 percent. But for EOS, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, searches gone in the opposite direction. Google searches for that term have jumped 97 percent this year. Much of that could be due to the company's recent fundraising efforts through what's known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. Start-up Block.one raised more than $4 billion through the cryptocurrency in a yearlong ICO that closed Friday. Unlike an IPO, which gives investors stock ownership in a company, an ICO gives out tokens whose use case is based on a promise the platform will be useful in a digital network once it gets built. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":480,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-tlBwr\"),window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tlBwr\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/04/105249087-GettyImages-963468364.jpg?v=1528122566", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Getty Images"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 75 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the beginning of this year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "three months"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Google Trends"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Nicholas Colas"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "DataTrek Research"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "Google Trends"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Colas"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Google Trends"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "100"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "January 1"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "37"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "9"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "June 2"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"8tiab\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Colas"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "roughly 2 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "both April"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "first-quarter"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "monthly"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "3.7 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Colas"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last quarter of 2017"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "monthly"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "7.6 percent"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "half"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018-to-date"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Colas"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "5%/month"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "roughly 50 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "7,500"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "CoinDesk"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "first"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 1,300 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "20,000"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "December"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "its day"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "today"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Colas"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Google"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "second"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "70 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "XRP"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "87 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "January 1"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "fourth"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "82 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "EOS"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "fifth"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Google"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "97 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Block.one"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "more than $4 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "yearlong"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Friday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tlBwr\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px"}], "description": "Searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have dropped more than 75 percent since the beginning of this year as interest in the cryptocurrency wanes.

Britain is selling some of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland for about 2.6 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), although it will realize a significant loss as it unwinds its holding and returns the bailed-out lender to private hands. The government said on Monday it would sell about 7.7 percent of RBS, which was rescued in a 45.5 billion pound bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, reducing its overall stake to 62 percent. Britain will make a loss on that investment, since the same number of shares were worth around 2 billion pounds more when the government made its initial and largest capital injection into RBS, at a price of 502 pence. The loss for taxpayers would be even greater when taking into account a break-even price of 625 pence per share estimated by Britain's National Audit Office, which includes the cost of financing. \"There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares,\" said British opposition Labour Party's finance chief John McDonnell, responding to reports on the sale. \"There should be no sales of RBS shares, full-stop. But because of this government's obsession with privatization, the taxpayers who bailed out the bank will now incur an enormous loss,\" he said. For RBS the sale marks the start of the last leg of a decade-long struggle to return to normality. \"Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge,\" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. RBS has reached a series of such milestones since the start of this year, including the resolution of an investigation by U.S. authorities into its sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis. \"As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long-term investment horizon,\" Khalaf said. RBS, whose shares closed at 280 pence on Monday, declined to comment on the sale process, which is being managed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The investment banks have already found buyers for all the shares, according to one of them, filling the order book within half an hour, in an indication of investor interest. The shares will be sold on Monday evening in a process known as an accelerated bookbuild to institutional investors, UK Government Investments, which manages the holding, said. Final pricing of the deal will become clear on Tuesday. The sale resumes a process the government began in 2015 when it sold the first tranche of its RBS shares - 5.4 percent of its stake - for 330 pence per share, at a 1.1 billion pound loss. That prompted criticism from opposition politicians, who accused the government of poor timing. Subsequent sales were put on hold pending the agreement of the multi-billion dollar settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.

The company, which is controlled by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, plans to accelerate the shift within the next few years, the sources said. They said the move was propelled, in part, by growing regulatory pressure on Ant's core financial businesses, including payments, microlending, credit rating and wealth management. Ant Financial was spun off from Alibaba, which went public in 2014, and has played a major role in shaping the financial technology landscape in China. Its Alipay online payment app is one of the biggest players in an increasingly cashless society. But in five years, technology services will make up 65 percent of Ant Financial's revenue, compared with an estimated 34 percent in 2017, according to confidential company projections viewed by Reuters. That would involve helping banks and other institutions with services like online risk management and fraud prevention. Meanwhile, revenue from financial services is projected to shrink to 6 percent from an estimated 11 percent, and the contribution from payments will be reduced to 28 percent from an estimated 54 percent in 2017, the figures show. Overall revenue is projected to grow at 40 percent annually from 2017 to 2021, the figures show. The shift better aligns Ant with the government's strategy for the financial sector while giving it room to grow and innovate, said Zennon Kapron, director at the Shanghai-based fintech consultancy Kapronasia. \"It makes a lot of sense for them to be focusing on the technology side because it plays to their strengths and it also fits within the government's view of the way that the financial industry would develop,\" he said. Ant Financial is preparing for long-awaited initial public offerings \u0393\u00c7\u00f4 expected to be in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2019 and expects to soon close a funding round to raise $10 billion that would give the company a valuation of $150 billion. The sprawling firm has amassed a range of financial licenses and has become a crucial part of China's massive and vulnerable financial system. That has concerned regulators, who want to make sure that the growing size of Ant and other private financial firms do not present systemic problems to the Chinese economy should they fail, the sources said. Ant Financial was singled out by the People's Bank of China as the only online finance firm for a trial programme to test stricter regulations on financial holding conglomerates, two of the sources said. \"As a non-bank, non-state-owned institution in China, it's not allowed to independently grow too big to manage,\" said one of the sources. \"Every aspect of the technology we have developed will one by one be opened up to current and potential partners,\" a spokesman for Ant said. For Ant and its investors, a successful transition is not guaranteed, as the company still has to figure out how to repurpose its advanced technology capabilities - which range from blockchain and artificial intelligence to security and cloud computing \u0393\u00c7\u00f4 for services tailored for customers like banks, the sources said. Away from financial services Ant has been feeling the pressure from regulators on a number of fronts. Under pressure from the central bank, Ant Financial's subsidiary Sesame Credit stopped issuing individual credit ratings, two of the sources with direct knowledge said. From now on, Sesame Credit will only be used for non-financial purposes, like credit checks for bike rentals and visa approvals, they added. Alipay, meanwhile, has been hit by a central bank decision to raise the reserve funds ratio of such third-party payment firms to 50 percent, two of the sources close to Ant's payment unit said. With the expectation that the ratio will be raised to 100 percent eventually, Alipay could face a further squeeze on profits, they added. Ant's micro-lending business has also come under pressure amid tighter regulatory control on key funding sources for the company like asset-backed securitization, leading it to look for loan-issuing partnerships with traditional banks, the other two sources said. One of the sources said the banking regulator keeps tabs on Ant's financial services almost daily at its headquarters in the city of Hangzhou. In recent weeks, Ant has announced agreements with mid-sized national lenders such as Hua Xia Bank Co, China Everbright Bank, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank to provide them with \"technology-driven solutions.\" Ant Financial has also set caps for its 1.69 trillion yuan ($263 billion) money market fund Yu'e Bao, the world's largest, to limit the amount users can invest per day and on some withdrawals. The moves followed a regulatory requirement for Ant Financial to control the size of the fund to reduce concentration and liquidity risks, according to one of the sources.

In an interview on CNBC's \"Futures Now,\" Tobias Levkovich said it's too premature to make investment decisions on whether a trade war will erupt over Trump tariffs, or if Italy's political crisis will spark a contagion. \"That's kind of geopolitical risks akin to what if there's a war with Iran. So, we don't predict those. If they occur, we have to react and we have to hedge portfolios,\" the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist said Thursday. His thoughts came as stocks tried to battle back into positive territory for the week. The Dow ultimately ended Friday securely in the green, gaining 219 points to close at 24,635. But it wasn't enough to give the Dow a winning week. The S&P 500 fared better. The index gained more than 1 percent to close around 2734, and saw its second positive week in a row. But by all accounts, Levkovich's stock market forecast isn't the rosiest. He's predicting a choppy year. \"We're actually trying to take advantage of some of the slowdown or the pullback,\" he said. He's particularly interested in select industrials, financials and energy. The groups have been showing weakness after 10-Year Treasury yields backed off levels over 3 percent. \"We still think bond yields are heading higher. Wage inflation is coming,\" said Levkovich. \"By the next six months, we should see higher yields which then benefit financials.\" Levkovich's S&P 500 year-end target is 2800, but his 2019 mid-year forecast isn't much higher. \"If you look at a 12 month time horizon, you'll probably get up to the high 2800s,\" he said. \"You're still talking about 7 or 8 percent total market return in terms of appreciation.\" Levkovich acknowledged his forecast may be disappointing to investors who want a record-breaking, double-digit performance like last year, adding \"We're all greedy.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Broadcom will handle all of Apple's need for a class of chip in its new iPhones, according to J.P. Morgan, spelling revenue of $10 per phone for the chipmaker. The semiconductor company will maintain total share of non-radio frequency chips used in the upcoming generation of Apple's phones, thereby becoming the sole provider of wireless charging, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS capabilities for the new models, according to analyst Harlan Sur. \"We believe Broadcom will maintain 100 percent share (non-radio frequency chipsets) on 2018 iPhone models with its dominant position as the premier connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS) chipset supplier and its close partnership with Apple on analog interface and wireless charging,\" Sur said in a note to clients Tuesday. \"We see 8 percent to 10 percent increase in non-radio frequency dollar content in the 2018 iPhone models \u2013 upgraded wireless charging chip, increased GPS/wireless charging attach rates are the big drivers,\" he added. The lucrative partnership should contribute to top-line growth, Sur added, ultimately driving profitability and free cash flow at the San Jose, California-based chipmaker. Broadcom declined comment for this story. J.P. Morgan expects Broadcom to report adjusted earnings per share of $4.77 on Thursday, when the company reports second-quarter earnings. Though in-line with consensus estimates for the second quarter, J.P. Morgan's third-quarter EPS projection of $4.63 is better than Wall Street expects, according to FactSet estimates. \"The market often forgets about Broadcom's dominance in wireless connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth, GPS), its close relationship with Apple as an ASIC supplier (mixed signal analog and wireless power) and this silicon content will continue to be a part of all of the 2018 iPhone models,\" the analyst added. \"Next year, we anticipate further content gains on the 2019 models as Apple will move to Broadcom's next generation\" of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi combo chips. In addition to the optimistic earnings projection, the analyst reiterated his overweight rating on Broadcom; his $337 price target implies more than 30 percent upside by the end of 2018 from Monday's close. Though the stock rose 0.3 percent Tuesday, Broadcom is underperforming the broader market so far this year, up 0.9 percent versus the S&P 500's 2.9 percent climb.

A cyberattack of devastating proportions is not a matter of if, but when, numerous security experts believe. And the scale of it, one information security specialist said this week, will be such that it will have its own name \u2014 like Pearl Harbor or 9/11. \"The more I speak to people, the more they think that the next Pearl Harbor is going to be a cyberattack,\" cybersecurity executive and professional hacker Tarah Wheeler told a panel audience during the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) annual forum in Paris. \"I think that the most horrifying cybersecurity attack is going to have its own name and I think it's going to involve something more terrifying than we've thought of yet.\" Wheeler is CEO and principal security advisor at Red Queen Technologies, a cybersecurity fellow at Washington, D.C.-based think tank New America, and former cybersecurity czar at multinational software firm Symantec. Explaining her premonition, Wheeler pointed to vital health and transport infrastructure she described as grossly under-protected. \"I think about the fact that most American healthcare technology is secured, if at all, with ancient, crumbling security infrastructure. I think of planes full of people, the kind of infrastructure that protects flu vaccinations. I think about fertility clinics losing years' worth of viable embryos,\" she said, stressing that people are not paying attention to that crumbling infrastructure. Critical infrastructure and industry Wheeler is not alone in her apocalyptic outlook. Not a single report from technology companies and researchers in this field claims that the cyberthreat environment is becoming less hostile or less significant. The World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Risks Report 2018 names cyberattacks and cyber warfare as a top cause of disruption in the next five years, coming only after natural disasters and extreme weather events. \"In a worst-case scenario, attackers could trigger a breakdown in the systems that keep societies functioning,\" the report said. Industry and critical infrastructure like power grids and water purification systems could be potential targets for hackers, whether they are small groups or state actors. show chapters Adm. Stavridis: We need to think about this cyberattack as a pandemic 7:58 AM ET Mon, 15 May 2017 | 03:06 Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who served as NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, echoed these warnings in a prior interview with CNBC: \"We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector... we need to think about this cyberattack as a pandemic.\" Artificial intelligence-focused security firm BluVector reported in February that almost 40 percent of all industrial control systems and critical infrastructure faced a cyberattack at some point in the second half of 2017. Unpatchable devices and the internet of things Companies and governments aren't doing enough to protect these systems, Wheeler said. \"The inevitability is based in the easy access to the kinds of exploits that still work 10, 15, 20 years after they've been revealed,\" she said, noting that there are still companies running critical infrastructure, including health infrastructure, on Windows XP and other platforms that are unpatchable \u2014 meaning they can't be updated for vulnerability and bug fixes. Many internet of things (IOT) devices, she described, are unpatchable by design. Valentyn Ogirenko | Reuters A message demanding money is seen on a monitor of a payment terminal at a branch of Ukraine's state-owned bank Oschadbank after Ukrainian institutions were hit by a wave of cyber attacks earlier in the day, in Kiev, Ukraine, June 27, 2017. IOT, which has been described as \"merging physical and virtual worlds, creating smart environments\" through devices connected to the internet and that communicate with one another, represents a whole new level of vulnerabilities. And cybercriminals have an exponentially increasing number of potential targets, the WEF report said, \"because the use of cloud services continues to accelerate and the internet of things is expected to expand from an estimated 8.4 billion devices in 2017 to a projected 20.4 billion in 2020.\" The chief executive of defense firm Raytheon International, John Harris, recently called cyberattacks the \"single biggest threat to global security,\" adding that \"the more we are connected, the more we are vulnerable.\" Listen to the hackers But Wheeler didn't specify who would likely be behind such acts, stressing that the nature of cyber warfare is asymmetric \u2014 and while there are state actors with hostile intentions, cyber weapons are accessible to just about anyone with the skills to deploy them. What's needed, Wheeler stressed, is \"sensible, deep, not broad, cybersecurity regulation that has teeth.\" She urged the private sector to listen to its \"early warning system\" \u2014 what she called the information security community, or hackers \u2014 rather than criminalizing their activity. Industry experts have encouraged best practices and a greater awareness of the threats across the public and private sectors, and call on both sides to improve collaboration. Niklas Halle'n | AFP | Getty Images The unprecedented global cyberattack has hit more than 200,000 victims in scores of countries, Europol said on May 14, 2017, warning that the situation could escalate when people return to work. In Britain, the attack disrupted care at National Health Service facilities, including The Royal London Hospital, part of the largest NHS Trust in England. The last two years have tested relations between countries amid allegations of Russian election hacking in the U.S. and cyberthreats emanating from North Korea, Iran and China, among others. In March, the Donald Trump administration blamed Russia for a string of cyberattacks going back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid. International attacks like the WannaCry virus, which affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries and NotPetya, the alleged Russian-directed attack that caused $300 million in damages to multinational companies, may be just a small glimpse of what is on the horizon.

Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist believes the stock market is in the midst of a cyclical bear market that could last through the end of next year. \"I think we're in a rolling bear market. Every sector has gone down at least 11 or 12 percent at least once this year. Some were down 18, 19, 20 percent,\" Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Thursday. \"It's fooling everybody at the index level, but there's a lot of pain out there: Staples, homebuilders, some of these semiconductor stocks that are more cyclical are having problems.\" The strategist's comment came as the major market indexes added to their weekly losses, with the S&P 500 down 0.3 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1.2 percent since Tuesday. Markets were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. show chapters Conditions for a bear market aren't present: Lee Cooperman 2:50 PM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 03:52 But while stocks were poised for a positive return for the month of May, volatility has plagued markets since the beginning of the year, with the Dow and S&P 500 both falling more than 10 percent from their highs at one point. In turn, the bumpy trading has signaled to many market gurus that aged bull market could finally be taking a breather. While stocks remain above their lows notched earlier this year, Wilson explained his definition of a bear market varies from traditional Wall Street wisdom. \"A bear market to me doesn't [necessarily] mean the market has to go down 20 percent,\" he said. \"A bear market is a tougher environment, it's hard to make money. Volatility is a lot higher, so I don't care what kind of portfolio you're running, you can't run as much risk anymore, you just can't do it.\" The most bearish strategist tracked by CNBC, Wilson has consistently forecasted that the S&P 500 will finish the year at 2,750, implying less than 1 percent upside for the broad market index over the remaining seven months. But the sluggish returns aren't likely to abate anytime soon, Wilson warned, telling CNBC that the cyclical bear market \"could last through the end of 2019.\" Many of Wilson's comments Thursday echoed Morgan Stanley analysis earlier this month, when the bank told clients in a note that the \"end of easy\" investing was over. \"We think it's pretty obvious that the market had discounted the news on tax cuts, global growth and still supportive financial conditions,\" Wilson wrote. \"In many ways a correction or consolidation was overdue and makes perfect sense. The question is whether or not this turns into something more sinister.\" Chief among Morgan Stanley worries have been a return of inflation, uncertain political outlook and tightening monetary policy, the lack of which helped fuel the unprecedented run in the U.S. stock market over the past nine years. The firm lowered its global equity allocation from overweight to equal weight in the note.

During that time the bank grappled with legal issues, while Staley also found himself the subject of an investigation. \"The last year and a half has had its challenges,\" he said in an interview with Wilf Frost on \"Closing Bell.\" Barclays reduced its head count by 56,000, sold 22 businesses around the world and closed its retail banking business across Africa and continental Europe, Staley said. On the legal front, Barclays was sued by the U.S. Department of Justice over its mortgage-backed securities business in 2006 and 2007 and was slapped with criminal charges by the British government for alleged unlawful financial assistance to Qatari investors. In March, Barclays agreed to pay $2 billion to settle the U.S. suit but denied misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing the instruments and allegations it committed mail fraud and bank fraud. Across the pond, a British court recently dismissed the charges in the 2008 capital-raising case. Meanwhile, Staley was fined 642,430 pounds ($870,428) in May by British regulators for breaching conduct rules by attempting to identify who sent letters criticizing an employee of the bank. The CEO said he felt that investigation was \"fair\" and \"robust\" and pointed out that Barclays is a \"very complicated, challenging bank.\" However, when asked if he ever feared that he may lose his job, he didn't directly respond. \"I feel that it was my obligation to commit my focus and attention to the Barclays shareholders, the Barclays customers and clients,\" he said. However, he believes now it is time for the bank to move forward. \"To a certain extent all of that is behind us and now we can look forward to running the bank and executing on our strategy,\" Staley said, pointing to the bank's \"great\" first quarter. For one, the bank gained \"significant\" market share. Plus, \"our return on equity in the markets business was in double digits in the first quarter,\" he added. \"So, not only did we gain market share, it was quite profitable for us.\" Barclays reported a better-than-expected first-quarter pretax profit of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in April. However, fines and legal costs led to a statutory loss. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

Morgan's Marko Kolanovic said in a note Wednesday. \"Taking the current market capitalization, this translates into $1.25 trillion of value destruction for U.S. companies.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points Thursday following the president's decision to include Canada, Mexico and the European Union in global steel and aluminum levies. Since then, the countries have responded in kind, suggesting tariffs of their own against American exports such as pork, peanut butter and motorcycles. tweet Trump, who's repeatedly highlighted gains in the stock market under his tenure, could actually spur equities higher if he stemmed his tough talk, the J.P.

Morgan's global quantitative and derivatives strategy, predicted the stock market correction earlier this year and highlighted complacency and high leverage in the market as warning signs. But in his Wednesday note, the strategist highlighted the impact of trade and protectionist ideology as \"significant\" market headwinds. \"A negotiation strategy that includes bluffing/threats can be successful in a two-party negotiation setup, but is more likely to deliver self-defeating results in a complex system such as global trade,\" he said. \"The value destroyed by a trade war might be reversible if policies are reversed, while the positive impact of fiscal measures is likely to remain. This would likely catalyze a rough 4 percent market rally.\" \"However, if this uncertainty hangs over the market for a more extended period of time, the damage becomes more permanent and the probability of a disruptive tail event increases,\" he concluded. \"Trade tensions continue to inflict damage to investor psychology and business confidence.\" To be sure, Trump's battle for more balanced trade could end up helping the economy. The trade deficit appears to be on the decline, falling to a seven-month low in April, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.

A government spokeswoman said the Baltic nation was not looking to issue its own national cryptocurrency as it already uses the euro as its official currency. Instead, Estonia plans to \"explore various possibilities\" for blockchain technology, such as the use of crypto tokens within its \"e-residency\" program, which gives both Estonians and foreigners a digital form of identification. Last year, Kaspar Korjus, managing director at Estonia's e-residency program, announced the proposal for a cryptocurrency called \"estcoin\" that could be issued by Estonia. Korjus said at the time that the estcoin tokens could be launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) \u2014 a form of fundraising for start-ups where new digital tokens are sold to raise money. Estonia joined the euro zone \u2014 a bloc of countries that have adopted the single currency \u2014 in 2010, becoming the first former Soviet nation to do so. Initial reports of Estonia's interest in cryptocurrency sparked a reaction from Europe's central bank chief. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said that \"no (European Union) member state can introduce its own currency.\" Triin Oppi, Estonia's media adviser, disputed a report by Bloomberg that claimed the country had \"scaled down\" plans to launch a cryptocurrency. She said such plans \"never existed.\" Oppi said that the e-residency program had \"initiated a discussion\" into whether Estonia should issue its own cryptocurrency and that the estcoin proposal was still on the table \"within the e-residency community.\" She said that the Estonian government was considering the possibility of providing a legal framework for ICOs, similar to a proposal from Japan. \"We strongly believe in the potential of blockchain technology as a tool for economic development, empowerment and inclusion and we notice that several private and public institutions worldwide are also exploring its opportunities,\" Oppi told CNBC in an email Monday. \"Estonia already has a vital start-up sector and we are looking for various initiatives to make it even stronger.

While U.S.-China trade talks remain unresolved, data shows the U.S. has lost more soybean sales to the Asian country this year than last. \"Soybean exports to China are down significantly from last year and the volume of outstanding sales is relatively low, indicating that there doesn't seem to be a large volume of sales waiting to be exported,\" Veronica Nigh, economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said in an email. Accumulated lost sales of U.S. soybeans to China in the marketing year ending Aug. 31 have grown so quickly that four weeks ago the level already surpassed that of the entire 2016-2017 marketing year, Nigh pointed out. Accumulated lost sales include cancellations, foreign purchases and destination changes. Note: Green bars indicate Trump administration announcements on trade. This past weekend, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross concluded negotiations with China on trade with no specific agreement. A White House statement said the two sides focused generally on supplying U.S. agriculture and energy products to China. Beijing has threatened to retaliate on the Trump administration's proposed tariffs with duties on U.S. goods such as soybeans. China is the second largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, and about one in three rows of U.S. soybeans go to the Asian giant, according to industry reports. \"At the moment the market environment, the business environment, is one that has extreme uncertainty underpinning it,\" Devry Boughner Vorwerk, corporate vice president, global corporate affairs at Cargill, told CNBC in a phone interview on Monday. \"With all the uncertainty hanging over our head with potential tariffs going into place, the U.S. may lose its position with one of its biggest customers.\" Minnesota-based agriculture giant Cargill has been operating in China for more than 40 years and operates six oilseed crush plants in the country, according to a letter Vorwerk sent the Office of U.S. Trade Representative on May 11. Note: Green bars indicate Trump administration announcements on trade. China canceled 136,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean purchases in the week ended May 24, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agriculture Service. That brings accumulated exports of U.S. soybeans to China for the marketing year to 27 million metric tons, 20.5 percent less than this time last year. Beijing said in a statement this weekend it is willing to increase imports from the U.S., but said any deal is off if the Trump administration goes through with tariffs, according to a report from state-backed newspaper Xinhua. On those conditions, China also offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources. That figure is a fraction of the $375.2 billion U.S. trade deficit with China that President Donald Trump would like to reduce. The trade dispute also involves protection of U.S. intellectual property and picked up in the last several months with the Trump administration's tariffs on steel imports. U.S. soybean futures are down 1.7 percent week-to-date to just above $10 a bushel. They dropped 1.9 percent last week, after rallying 4.3 percent the week prior in the wake of a pause in the trade dispute. To be sure, overall U.S. soybean exports to China were expected to decline in the current marketing year due to a historical low in U.S. soybean protein content, Rich Nelson, director of research at market research and trading firm Allendale, told CNBC last month. The cancellations and declines in Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans in the last several weeks also come during a time when China tends to shift its buying to Brazil due to seasonal factors. \"We believe China would still like to commit to purchasing from the U.S. market,\" Cargill's Vorwerk said.

The U.S. payments giant has a product called Masterpass that allows a user to upload credit card details and acts as an easy way to pay for things online. Recently, the company launched a facility for people to pay with Masterpass for products within Facebook Messenger. A user would interact with a brand by messaging them on Messenger. When they buy a product, Masterpass can be used to pay. It's a trend Mastercard is calling \"conversational commerce\" and it extends to voice too. Ann Cairns, vice chairman at Mastercard, said that buying items using voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant will \"become very big\" in the future. When asked whether Mastercard is looking to integrate Masterpass with these voice assistants, Cairns said, \"Yes, of course.\" \"We're looking at all of these technologies and we're thinking about how they link on the Mastercard network,\" Cairns told CNBC at the Money 20/20 Europe fintech conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Monday. Masterpass can be used to pay for apps on the Google Play store. Mastercards can be used on Amazon and Google already too. Cairns said any integration into voice assistants would be an extension of the relationship between Mastercard and the technology firms. \"We're already integrated into many of Amazon's and Google's products so really it's more of a new product function, product line, that we're looking at. But we're also looking at how is artificial intelligence deployed,\" she said. Mastercard is watching for ways to adapt to the shifts in consumer behavior when it comes to payments. Masterpass was the company's answer to products such as Apple Pay. A number of technology firms are increasingly dipping their toes into financial services and Mastercard is trying to stay ahead through some of these technology products.

Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable, said the group of CEOs has thrown its support behind companies backing away from the practice. Executives often feel pressure to make quarterly forecasts, but \"it can often put a company in a position where management from the CEO down feels obligated to deliver earnings and therefore may do things that they wouldn't otherwise have done,\" Dimon said in a rare joint interview with Buffett airing Thursday on CNBC's Squawk Box. \"Quarterly earnings: they're a function of the weather, commodity prices, volumes, competitor pricing. And you don't really control that as CEO,\" he added. \"Sometimes you're just like the cork in the ocean, but do the right thing anyway and you're going to be fine in the long run.\" \"You should build the systems you need, you should do the R&D that you need and explain it to your shareholders and your board. Of course, some of the CEOs will say it's the sell side, that we put pressure, but what I'm trying to say to people: be free to drop it.\" Dimon, the chairman and CEO of J. P. Morgan Chase, and Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote about the group's endorsement in an opinion column in The Wall Street Journal. It is a long-simmering debate but one that has gotten more attention in an era when activist investors are more vocal about pushing companies to deliver on their promises. Companies forecast sales and profit numbers to Wall Street analysts, who use it to produce research and stock recommendations for investors. Missing \"the number\" can often result in big, short-term stock moves. Making a forecast, and then hitting the target, are seen as a way to manage expectations and eliminate volatility. Mark Urban | CNBC Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway doesn't give guidance, which Buffett has said can tempt executives to manipulate numbers to meet Street expectations. It's \"sending the wrong message,\" Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick in the interview. \"When companies get where they're sort of living by so-called making the numbers, they do a lot of things that really are counter to the long-term interests of the business.\" Buffett and Dimon helped produce a set of voluntary governance guidelines two years ago, which was signed by more than one dozen executives. One of the principles outlined in that report said companies shouldn't feel obligated to give quarterly guidance, which for years many have blamed for making executives obsessed with short-term results. Those in favor of guidance say it improves communications with Wall Street, reduces share price volatility and boosts a stock's value. But McKinsey & Co. found in a 2006 study that quarterly guidance didn't affect valuation multiples and didn't reduce share price volatility. The only significant benefit it observed was an increase in trading volumes, which is good for day traders but not useful for most other people. David A. Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Instead, McKinsey found, the practice of giving quarterly guidance took up valuable time from management and made them focus too much on the short term. Around that time, big companies like Coca Cola, UPS and AT&T said they would no longer give quarterly guidance. Dimon said Thursday that about 20 percent of Business Roundtable members still do quarterly guidance and about 60 percent provide annual targets. But, he added, taking a stand on the issue is \"a first step.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/08/104640085-Dimon-Intv-144.jpg?v=1537822279", "keywords": [{"category": "PERSON", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Dimon"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "7:09 AM ET Thu"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "7 June 2018"}, {"category": "PRODUCT", "term": "07:09 Warren Buffett"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jamie Dimon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the end to quarterly"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Dimon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Business Roundtable"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "quarterly"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Dimon"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Buffett"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Squawk Box"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Quarterly"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Dimon"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "J.

They will be able to connect it to their brokerage account to verify they own Tesla shares, and then click one of two buttons, one for keeping Musk in that role and one against. It is a mobile app and a website. Ultimately, the app is aiming to make it easier for regular investors to take advantage of their ownership rights and make their votes count, Say's co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Cruttenden told CNBC. He got the idea through his other start-up, a micro-investing robo advisor called Acorns. For Tesla's meeting, the Say \"vote\" is really a poll. Actual ballots cast for the Tesla proxy had to come from shareholders of record as of April 12 and voted through a broker. Say is working on connecting to brokers so it can handle shareholder verification and voting at some point in the future. Technology has made trading and investing easy, but the voting part of it for a long time \"has not been exactly customer-friendly,\" Cruttenden said. \"The proxy voting experience was so terrible that we really wanted to make sure that we could improve it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. It's an open question how motivated Tesla's shareholders will be to vote for change. While big fund companies and professional investors have high rates of voting participation, only 27 percent of retail investors vote, according to a report by Broadridge Financial and PwC. And voting tends to go along with management recommendations. Last year, 93 percent of votes were cast in support of director nominees and 84 percent in support of executive pay, the report said. Tesla is nearly half-owned by big fund companies, and Musk holds another nearly 20 percent stake, according to FactSet. Cruttenden said generally, turnout is low for electronic proxy voting, about 5 percent, as well as paper ballots, about 30 percent. And it skews to older, wealthier shareholders. Younger or newer investors don't necessarily know they can vote, he said. Tesla shareholders vote for an independent chairman at the electric automaker's annual meeting Tuesday. Musk has been chairman since 2004 and CEO since 2008. A shareholder proposal pushing the idea of an independent chairman has the support of proxy voting advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, though the company is urging people to vote against it. The shareholder contends that the job has gotten too complex for one person. Musk has been scrambling to get Tesla's Model 3 production on track against scrutiny of the company's manufacturing abilities. He also has a variety of other projects, including space transport, solar power and high-speed tunnel travel. \"The complexity of large-scale manufacturing and the challenges of successfully commercializing new technologies and new manufacturing and marketing techniques suggest that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company, and allowing an independent director to run the board,\" ISS said in a report last month. It is usually difficult for shareholders to win campaigns, though big labor unions representing pensions and faith-based groups have raised issues from corporate governance to environmental and social issues for years with mixed results. Activists led by a religious group recently won a surprise vote at gunmaker Sturm Ruger, requiring it to prepare a report on the risks associated with its business. The shareholder pushing the vote at Tesla isn't a major activist with a big following, either. Instead, Jing Zhao, a California resident with just 12 shares of Tesla, says he filed the proposal to bring the issue to the attention of the board and will be content that shareholders got to consider it, whether or not it passes. \"Even if this does not get the majority, it puts pressure on the board,\" Zhao told CNBC in a phone interview. \"I don't believe even a superhuman can do so many things.\" Say is backed with $8 million in first-round funding from Steve Cohen's Point72 Ventures and other investors. Eventually, the app can be used to vote on issues at other companies, but Cruttenden says he picked Tesla's meeting because it was a prominent stock and a big enough issue to draw attention, regardless of the outcome of the vote itself. \"When owners get together, that's very powerful,\" he said.

Coinbase, which has traded $150 billion in assets across more than 20 million customers, has been plowing money back into areas other than its flagship exchange. In April, the company bought Earn.com for a reported $100 million, which lets users send and receive digital currency for replying to mass-market emails and completing micro tasks. As part of the acquisition, the crypto company will bring on Earn's founder and CEO, a former Andreessen Horowitz venture capitalist, as its first-ever chief technology officer. Coinbase reportedly valued itself at about $8 billion when it set out to buy Earn.com, according to Recode, much higher than a valuation of $1.6 billion at its last round of venture capitalist financing in summer 2017. In May, the company announced a fleet of products to cater to the institutional investor class, which has been especially cautious to dive into what has been a volatile asset class. Coinbase launched an index fund in March, and a month later launched Coinbase Ventures, an incubator fund for early-stage start-ups working in cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It has $15 million geared up for investments and recently announced its first deal with start-up Compound, which lets you lend or borrow cryptocurrency and earn an interest rate.

The idea of a united Europe is a centuries-old dream come true. It has survived massive butcheries perpetrated by Charlemagne, Napoleon and Hitler who \u2014 in their own different ways \u2014 thought they could unite and dominate the continent through fire, terror and untold crimes. The British joined the European common market \u2014 a fledgling free-trade area \u2014 in the early 1970s, because that's all they wanted. They voted to leave when, after decades of slippages toward an increasingly federal structure, they realized they did not want to board up the Palace of Westminster in rampant sovereignty transfers to the EU Commission. But London is now fighting to remain part of the EU's genuine free-trade area (i.e., the single market) \u2014 without telling the British people about political implications of an arrangement guaranteeing the free movement of goods, services and factors of production. Italy is a very different case. Rome's EU membership was enthusiastically enshrined in a treaty solemnly celebrated on the Capitoline Hill \u2014 hence the Treaty of Rome \u2014 in March 1957. Ever since, a country that formally reunited itself during a period of nearly 60 years in the 19th century, has been one of the staunchest supporters of the European project. Italians mismanaged their economy That is still the case. Correctly reading the mood of the Italians, the country's President Sergio Mattarella told a few weeks ago the leaders of the Five Star Movement and the League not to come back to him for approval of a government advocating Italy's exit from the EU and the euro area. They did not listen, came up with the wrong people and Mattarella sent them packing. Ultimately, they had to present a new government to pass the president's EU screening test. Mattarella knew that the idea of leaving the EU was one of those Italian political jokes that Germans take seriously. Indeed, anybody who knows anything about Italy also knows that the Italian people, and Italy's political establishment of all stripes, are not against the European Union. No, they are only emphatically against \u2014 what they apparently believe \u2014 is a union run by Germany on German terms. That's an unfortunate \u2014 and fundamentally incorrect \u2014 view of how things really stand, and how they should be. It is a ploy to hide the sad truth that Italian politicians have gravely mismanaged their economy. Germany had relatively little to do with that. Here are a few things to think about. First, Italy's unreformed and unaffordable welfare state has led to calamitous public sector accounts. The country's gross public debt stood at 155 percent of GDP at the end of last year, which compares with the euro area average of 105 percent of GDP. It has a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP \u2014 nearly three times the euro area's average of 0.9 percent. Even with historically low credit costs, Italy's interest charges on public debt now account for 3.6 percent of GDP, the highest in the industrialized world and double the euro area's average of 1.7 percent of GDP. Second, that leaves no space for tax cuts or higher public spending to create a policy mix with easy credit conditions that would support stronger economic growth and employment creation. Italy's government spending of 48.9 percent of GDP still stands above the euro area's average of 47 percent of GDP. Third, to keep its huge public debt on a declining path \u2014 toward the euro area mandated objective of 60 percent of GDP \u2014 Italy must run large and steady surpluses on its primary budget balances (i.e., budget before interest charges on public debt). These surpluses have now come down to 2.2 percent of GDP from an average of 4 percent during the period from 2012 to 2015. Push Germany to change its economic policy Fourth, to argue, as the new government does, that Italy can grow its way out of this fiscal bind is to believe the fairy tales told by five star comedians. Italy must bear down on its budget deficits and keep trimming unaffordable public spending. As a result of that, Rome can only get a sustainable support to growth from easy money and exports. Germans will keep screaming about the negative real short-term interest rates, but the European Central Bank will maintain accommodative policies as long as the euro area's core inflation rate of about 1 percent remains far below the medium-term target of 2 percent. On exports, Italians would have to pick a fight with Germany \u2014 a country that is making a mint off its EU trade partners. As President Donald Trump would say: That should be an easy win. Germany is clearly going overboard on that one. This year, Berlin expects a whopping current account surplus of $340 billion, or 8.3 percent of GDP. That could be an opening salvo in Italy's attempt to chip at German-dominated EU policies. But let's cut Germany some slack. France, Italy and the rest of the euro area don't have to put up with German policies that are robbing them of their growth and employment. They can force Germany to change its ways \u2014 without waiting for Trump to read the riot act to free-trade abusers and inveterate trade surplus artists. Italy also did not have to sign on to euro area rules it could not live by. Decisions are taken in a unanimous vote. Italy should have simply vetoed things it could not do, or taken a British-style opt-out. It is, therefore, disingenuous to blame Germany for Italy's policy mistakes. Investment thoughts There is no constituency strong enough to wreck the EU's epochal project of a continent that is free, peaceful, united and prosperous. Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2014 76 percent of the euro area \u2014 have particular responsibility to run a stable common currency as a pillar of a broader union to generate steady growth, high employment and price stability. For that to happen, Germany must balance its intra-EU trade accounts to allow other countries to grow, create jobs and square their public finances. Germany now generates 65 percent of its trade surpluses on the back of other EU members. That cannot continue and Berlin seems willing to talk about it. But Germany is now a sharply divided country in a sulking mood. The governing coalition is tearing itself up, and, to top it all off, a widely read and respected German news outlet ran this column on Friday: \"Rage against the Germans. Nobody likes us \u2014 just why?\" A good place to start looking for an answer might be a lack of tact, empathy and comity in German dealings with other EU member states. In spite of those difficulties, the European project remains on track. The euro-denominated assets are sound investment choices thanks to the ECB \u2014 arguably the best and the most useful institution the Europeans have created so far.

Microsoft instead 5:07 PM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 00:53 Microsoft was not alone in chasing GitHub, which it agreed to acquire for $7.5 billion on Monday. Representatives from Alphabet's Google were also talking to the company about an acquisition in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the deal talks. The talks for GitHub went on for several weeks, according to several other people familiar with the process, but at the end the auction was not close, suggesting Microsoft's bid was high enough to keep Google at bay. GitHub has, in the past, also attracted takeover interest from companies such as Amazon, according to people familiar with the matter. These people declined to be named, as they were not authorized to discuss the deal with press. Microsoft paid 25 times revenue for GitHub, said one person, which calculates to annual revenue of about $300 million for the code-sharing service, according to one of these people involved in the deal. Last August, the company said it had an annualized run rate of $200 million, and in October it said it was on track to book more than $100 million a year from its enterprise products alone. Google and Microsoft declined to comment on the acquisition process. Microsoft has seen its once-dominant Windows unit slip in market share in recent years, spurring a cloud-first reorganization and sending Microsoft looking for alternatives to court developers. Owning GitHub and LinkedIn also means that Microsoft now owns two top professional networks -- important in the continuing war for scarce tech talent. While Google is making progress in its cloud efforts, the company has so far not made any big acquisitions in the cloud space under leader Diane Greene, who also sits on Alphabet's board of directors. This contrasts sharply with Microsoft's big acquisitions of GitHub and LinkedIn, which cost $26 billion. Cloud applications company Salesforce has also grown in part through significant acquisitions, most recently paying $6.5 billion to buy Mulesoft, whose technology helps software developers stitch disparate applications together. Why Microsoft? GitHub founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath has limited his efforts to make money from the service out of a desire to give free tools to developers, but was drawn to Microsoft because of his relationship with CEO Satya Nadella, one person said. Since taking over Microsoft four years ago, Nadella has embraced open-source software and programmer tools to restore growth and attract third-party developers. show chapters Microsoft CEO on GitHub acquisition 11:36 AM ET Mon, 4 June 2018 | 08:26 GitHub has been an acquisition target for years, and repeatedly spurned requests from companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, according to people familiar with the matter.

Amazon and Atlassian declined comment. Tencent didn't respond to requests for comment. \"There has been interest in GitHub for a long time,\" said Peter Levine, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which first backed GitHub in 2012. \"They had lots of options. There's a real strategic fit at Microsoft.\" Levine would not name specific companies who had approached GitHub. Andreessen invested $100 million into GitHub in 2012, the \"largest single check we had ever written,\" Levine wrote in a blog post on Monday. A follow-on funding round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital, valued GitHub at $2 billion. Nadella won over Wanstrath in the last 24 months with his vision for GitHub fitting within Microsoft, one person close to the deal said. New CEO Nat Friedman, who joined Microsoft through a prior acquisition, plans to run GitHub independently for the time being. That is similar to how Microsoft kept LinkedIn largely independent -- although GitHub will eventually become a part of Microsoft's growing commercial cloud business alongside products like Office 365 and Dynamics 365, Friedman told CNBC in an interview. If anything, Microsoft wants GitHub to get even better at being GitHub, Friedman said. GitHub has had ongoing conversations with Microsoft for several years, so the acquisition didn't begin with any single event, Wanstrath told CNBC. The companies have a shared mission to help developers be more efficient and more collaborative, he said. Neither Friedman nor Wanstrath would comment on the acquisition process.

Shares of the major cruise-line companies fell broadly on Tuesday after an analyst at Morgan Stanley said he expect the space to get hit by weak travel demand. Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line all dropped more than 4 percent and were the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line had their biggest one-day declines since 2016 while Royal Caribbean posted its worst day since April. Cruise line stocks have been under pressure this year, dropping at least 5 percent. \"We remain relatively cautious on the cruise lines given the high and increasing level of industry supply growth, slowing yield momentum, and weakness in the Caribbean and China,\" Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Tuesday. \"Globally, the cruise industry orderbook has risen to a record 244k [beds] (45% supply growth to 2025). \u2026So for the industry to maintain, say, 2-3% yield growth, demand would need to grow by 7.5-9.5% annually, which for four consecutive years seems optimistic and is much more than historical levels (6% demand, 1% yield, 5% capacity),\" Rollo said. \"Our channel checks show solid booking volumes but at flat prices, and agents cite concerns about the Caribbean and general Q4 demand,\" the analyst added. The analyst added that a stronger dollar, coupled with rising fuel costs, led him to cut his earnings per share estimates on Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line by 11 percent, 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for fiscal 2019. \u2014 CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report.

About 490 employees will also get job offers from Flagstar, which is based in Troy, Michigan. It is part of a larger cull Wells Fargo announced in January, when it said it would cut more than 800 locations by 2020 to get its network down to 5,000. Last year, it closed 214 branches. Wells executives have cited consumer preference for online and mobile banking as the reason to close or sell branches, but litigation costs have also risen related to investigations into sales practices in several business units. Wells has also previously announced plans to cut $4 billion in annual expenses by the end of next year. The branch sales include 33 in Indiana, 14 in Michigan, one in Ohio and four in Wisconsin.

One of the world's largest digital currency exchanges shut down briefly Tuesday morning due to a cyberattack. Bitfinex was targeted in what's known as a DDoS, or a distributed denial-of-service attack, which overwhelms a system with multiple virus-infected servers. \"The previous outage was caused by issues with one of our infrastructure providers,\" the company said on its website. \"While the platform was recovering, the attack caused extreme load on the servers.\" TWEET Bitcoin prices fell 2 percent following the news, hitting a low of $7,373.47, according to data from CoinDesk. Trading on Bitfinex had resumed as of roughly 11 a.m. ET and the company said it was \"monitoring the situation closely.\" Before it announced the attack, Bitfinex said trading was paused while it underwent \"unplanned maintenance.\" \"The attack only impacted trading operations, and user accounts and their associated funds/account balances were not at risk at any point during the attack,\" a Bitfinex spokesperson told CNBC. Bitfinex was founded in Hong Kong in 2012 as a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange, and later added support for other cryptocurrencies. Last June, hackers targeted it and other exchanges as bitcoin rallied. Bitfinex also suspended trading in August 2016 after a hack resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 bitcoins. Security has been an issue for multiple global exchanges. In January, hackers stole about $500 million worth of a lesser-known cryptocurrency from major Japanese exchange Coincheck. In December, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange called Youbit lost 17 percent of its digital assets. Its parent Yapian later filed for bankruptcy. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was the first high-profile hack. It filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and said it lost 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and 100,000 of the exchange's own. The company was the largest bitcoin exchange at the time.

The tally of names disclosed on Tuesday showed the ambition of newly empowered antitrust regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which revealed on Friday it planned to seek charges against the investment banks over a 2015 share-raising for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), plus ANZ itself. The regulator said charges over the share placement have been laid against Citi's former Australia head Stephen Roberts, its current local head of capital markets John McLean and its London-based head of foreign exchange trading Itay Tuchman, along with Deutsche's former local chief Michael Ormaechea and former local capital markets head Michael Richardson. It said charges were also laid against ANZ, its treasurer Rick Moscati, as well as the two investment banks. \"These serious charges are the result of an ACCC investigation that has been running for more than two years,\" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. He declined to comment further since the matter was before the court. ANZ, Citi, and Deutsche have previously said they would defend the charges. After the names of the people being charged were released, Deutsche said it continued to believe it and its staff had acted responsibly, in the interests of clients and legally. \"Both Michael Ormaechea and Michael Richardson are highly regarded and have our full support,\" a spokeswoman said in an email. Citi, which has said the regulator appeared to have criminalized standard practices in capital raisings without warning, and ANZ were not immediately available for comment. The charges come at a difficult time for Australia's financial sector which is facing a year-long public misconduct inquiry that has brought embarrassing headlines on an almost daily basis. Earlier this week, the country's biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), paid a record A$700 million ($535 million) to settle a civil lawsuit in which it was accused of more than 50,000 breaches of anti-money laundering protocols. The charges against ANZ and its investment banks, which can carry hefty fines and 10-year prison terms, could lead to changes in the way institutional capital raisings are handled, and do further damage to the reputation of Australian lenders. The placement was made when Australian banks were under pressure to meet new capital requirements, which prompted ANZ and CBA to raise a combined A$8 billion in a single week. The regulators disclosed the names of the people charged after the close of share trading on Tuesday. ANZ shares closed down 0.3 percent, in line with the broader market, but are down 7 percent since the inquiry started in February. The ACCC has been building a team of investigators since cartel conduct was criminalized in 2009, and was further empowered last year with new laws governing competition. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which brought the charges on behalf of the ACCC, said further details would not be made public until after the first court appearance in Sydney on July 3.

Though small compared with some of the more established areas of Amazon's portfolio, the private label sales should generate $7.5 billion on Amazon's online marketplace in 2018, up 108 percent from SunTrust's previously published 2017 estimate of $3.6 billion, Squali said. \"According to Coresight Research, Amazon's private label brands are the fourth most bought clothing or footwear 'brand' on Amazon.com, with only Nike, Under Armour and Hanes ranking higher,\" he wrote. \"We have chronicled roughly 70 private label launches/acquisitions over the past year alone, for a total of 100 or more currently. ... We believe Amazon is positioning itself within select categories including Electronics, Food, Apparel, all of which share a number of similarities including a very large total available market.\" Disclaimer WATCH: Amazon under scrutiny for being too big show chapters Amazon under scrutiny for being too big 7:05 AM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 03:56 ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/03/14/105065344-amazon2.jpg?v=1534957489", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon.com Wall Street"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$25 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2022"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SunTrust Robinson Humphrey"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 21 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the next 12 months"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Youssef Squali"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the last 20 years"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Squali"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "one"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Unfair"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Cramer"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "11:05 AM ET Mon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "4 June 2018"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "01:05"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "2,000"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "1,900"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "42 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "2.7 percent"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "1.45 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Monday"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "1,665.27"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past few years"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Whole Foods Market"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Nike"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Calvin Klein"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$7.5 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "108 percent"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SunTrust"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$3.6 billion"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Squali"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Coresight Research"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORDINAL", "term": "fourth"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon.com"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Nike"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Armour"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "roughly 70"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "the past year alone"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "100"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Electronics, Food"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "Apparel"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Disclaimer WATCH"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Amazon"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "7:05 AM ET Thu"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "31"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "May 2018"}], "description": "Wall Street isn't giving Amazon enough credit for its private label venture, which should grow to $25 billion in revenue by 2022, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/suntrust-amazons-private-label-business-to-help-stock-rally-20-percent.html", "author": "Source: Amazon.com", "title": "Amazon's flourishing private label business to help stock rally another 20%, analyst says"}, {"time": "2018-06-07T00:45:37-0400", "body": " Aly Song | Reuters Imports from the U.S. are seen at a supermarket in Shanghai, China April 3, 2018.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross visited Beijing over the weekend to negotiate on trade with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture also participated in the talks.

In 2015, brokers working on behalf of a mystery client in London, offered these funds the chance to make a trade they thought was impossible to lose: betting that a teetering Norwegian paper company would imminently default on its debt. The hedge funds snapped up hundreds of millions of dollars of the derivatives contracts that would pay out in the event of a default. By the time the buyers realised who was on the other side of the trade it was too late: they had been trapped. One hedge fund manager recalls receiving a call from a sympathetic contact pleading with him to exit a trade. \"It was an off-the-record warning in order to protect me,\" he says. \"He basically told me who was on the other side. It was him.\" The \"him\" was Akshay Shah, at the time a managing director at the Blackstone Group's GSO hedge fund unit, who for nearly a decade spearheaded a series of unconventional trades that made him the most feared operator in European credit markets, terrorising a string of rival hedge funds and costing them millions in trading losses. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The aftermath of the complex trades Mr. Shah helped pioneer have shaken the $10tn market for credit default swaps to its core, leaving a trail of at least three lawsuits and recriminations between the world's largest private equity group and some of the most powerful names in finance. The trades have also highlighted a shift in the balance of power on Wall Street since the financial crisis, where the so-called non-bank lenders such as GSO have leveraged the infrastructure and reach of parent private equity groups to become more feared than the once dominant proprietary trading desks of Goldman Sachs and the other leading investment banks. \"This is symbolic of a shift in power away from banks like Goldman to non-bank institutions like Blackstone,\" says a former Goldman Sachs partner. The credit default swap, a financial instrument intimately associated with the losses incurred by the banks during the US subprime mortgage crisis, is most commonly used to either hedge against a company falling into trouble and possibly not paying off its debts, or as a tool of outright speculation over whether a default will occur. How it worked 1. GSO buys a CDS contract on a struggling company from another hedge fund. The CDS is like an insurance contract: it pays out if the company defaults. 2. GSO then approaches the company and offers it very attractive financing (a low interest loan for example) with an unusual condition: it has to default in a way that will trigger a payout on the CDS contract. 3. The company carries out this proposal, for example by paying interest on a bond a few days late, causing little concern to bondholders but \"triggering\" the CDS contracts 4. The hedge fund then has to pay a lump sum to GSO given that the company has defaulted The GSO unit at Blackstone where Mr. Shah worked became the biggest predator in the global CDS market by going beyond merely trying to predict when companies would fail. Instead it used Blackstone's substantial influence to directly intervene in struggling businesses, changing their fates in ways that maximised profits on GSO's trades. The strategy allowed GSO, which has $140bn of assets under management, to radically alter the odds in its favour by inventing a trade that had never been seen before: the manufactured default. It is the debt equivalent of a controlled explosion: offering a company favourable financing, such as low interest loans, to convince it to intentionally default in a way that will trigger payouts on CDS contracts, but without bringing down the whole company. By doing this GSO pushed its trading edge on rivals to the limits of what many saw as legal. \"I don't believe it's classified as insider trading, but it's pretty damn close,\" says one retired trader who came up against GSO and Mr. Shah. \"It's quite frankly shocking that they were able to get away with doing that for so long and that no one was prepared to stand up to it.\" \"I compare it to sports gambling,\" says Aitan Goelman, former head of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division, about manufactured defaults. \"If gamblers went out and paid players to throw games, everyone would intuitively know that was fraudulent. Highly sophisticated and not particularly upstanding actors are looking for any edge they can get: if they see areas of the law that are vague or poorly defined, they see this as an opportunity.\" While rivals and observers are shocked at GSO's tactics, it has never been accused of breaking any regulations. GSO argues that the assistance it provides to distressed businesses in exchange for them triggering payouts on CDS contracts are welcomed by those companies as it helps them to survive, and only damages other hedge funds caught out speculating on their failure. \"Our financing solutions were determined in competitive processes and provided the most favourable terms and crucial financial support to businesses with thousands of employees,\" Blackstone said in a statement. \"They were also wholly compliant with the market's well-established rules and consistent with the expectations of its sophisticated market participants.\" So effective and surprising was GSO's strategy that it ensnared some of the most revered names in trading, including BlueCrest, founded by billionaire Michael Platt, and Goldman Sachs. BlueCrest declined to comment. The controversy this year filtered up to the highest echelons of Wall Street, as a controversial trade GSO orchestrated around struggling US homebuilder Hovnanian was discussed in a meeting between Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein and Jon Gray, president and heir apparent of Blackstone. Goldman had earlier taken the unusual step of complaining in public about manufactured defaults, with the senior trader in charge of the trade telling the FT this year that \"the Hovnanian situation could embolden investors to pursue manufactured credit events with other corporate issuers, which would undermine the true intention and spirit of the CDS market\". Having for years sat at the top of the trading food chain, observers said it would have been unthinkable in the past for a Goldman partner to complain in public about being bested in a trade. \"It is ironic any Goldman guy would be asking in public to be protected [from GSO] like this,\" says the retired Goldman partner. \"Goldman always had a phrase internally, the 'big boy letter', the letter clients sign to show they knew what the risks were of trading with Goldman.\" Rival hedge funds, investment bankers and consultants describe GSO's success as being driven by both its traders' attention to detail, as well as the unrivalled ability of Blackstone's reputation and infrastructure to support its trades. When Mr. Shah joined GSO in 2008 from Lehman Brothers, few could fault his timing \u2014 the investment bank collapsed six months later. He had built a reputation as a sharp-minded analyst on Lehman's fixed-income trading desk. And having arrived at GSO, which that year had been purchased by Blackstone, Mr. Shah began working on finding ways to make money for its investment funds in the European debt market. People familiar with his trading style say he pores over hundreds of pages of bond or loan documents, trying to find tiny details that others in the market might miss. Once he identifies chinks in the wording of particular clauses he plots a way to construct trades using derivatives on whether a company will default on its debts, which would lure rivals to take the other side. \"He's a sniper,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"He would call you up and say 'Hey, what are you doing, what are you thinking on this?' and he knows all the information already, he's just fishing for what you know and what you think so he can work around it.\" GSO would then directly approach company managements with proposals that guaranteed it would profit on the CDS. Ahead of the approach, Mr. Shah would often hire external consultants for role-playing purposes, shadowboxing with them in a specific country's law or corporate culture until the pitch was finely tuned. \"You need to have a management team willing to screw people,\" says one distressed debt investor. In the case of Codere, a cash-strapped Spanish gaming company, Mr. Shah first used the manufactured default. GSO offered the struggling company a liquidity lifeline in 2013 with an unusual condition: Codere had to pay interest on its publicly traded bonds just a few days late, causing little concern to its bondholders but triggering CDS payouts. Despite the unwanted publicity the Codere trade attracted for Blackstone \u2014 it was dissected by comedian Jon Stewart on primetime US television in 2013 \u2014 Mr. Shah grew to become one of GSO's most senior managing directors, and sat on its European investment committee. \"Akshay wasn't some cowboy,\" says a former trader. \"He was reporting into the most senior people at GSO.\" Rivals argue that GSO was uniquely placed to not only gain access to greater information than many rivals, but could also use Blackstone's reputation to open doors to corporate management teams. \"To do these sorts of trades you need the size and the money. Only GSO had the money, the influence to pull this off,\" says one person active in the European debt markets. \"Blackstone is a great brand to have behind you.\" Mr. Shah used all the levers at Blackstone's disposal to push through one of GSO's most controversial trades in 2015-16. The tussle over the CDS of heavily indebted Norwegian paper company Norske Skog resulted in a bitterly fought court battle in New York, as rival hedge fund BlueCrest tried in vain to block GSO's gambit. The trade was essentially the opposite of Codere: charging other hedge funds large premiums to bet on a company's rapid demise before doing everything possible to keep it alive for long enough to avoid having to pay anything out. For Norske Skog, GSO pooled its firepower with rival hedge fund Cyrus to buy a substantial equity stake and then lobby for changes to its board, before getting management to formally adopt a proposal tailored to maximise the profits on the funds' CDS positions. \"We believe the company will once again run into trouble after GSO and Cyrus have cleared their CDS positions and no longer have the incentive to support the company with as much determination and creativity,\" Rahul Gandhi, an analyst at research firm CreditSights, said in March 2016. His prediction proved prescient. The CDS contracts were settled in June 2016 and 18 months later, in December 2017, Norske Skog filed for bankruptcy. By that point, Mr. Shah's career at GSO had also met a seemingly untimely end. In the spring of 2017 the scourge of London's traders suddenly parted ways with the firm, which liquidated a more than $3bn distressed debt fund he managed. One former employee of the division says the headlines such controversial CDS trades generate are no longer compensated for by the gains, as Blackstone's in-house credit unit shifts its focus to the less acrimonious practice of making direct loans to private companies. \"It's not a place that loves this publicity and in 2018 it has to look like a friendly provider of capital,\" he says. This more conciliatory approach was clearly seen in the surprising resolution to the Hovnanian trade last month. The homebuilder announced at the last minute that it was not going through with the manufactured default, as GSO and rival hedge fund Solus reached a settlement over the trade. The Blackstone unit has also in recent months struck a deal with Goldman where GSO bought back some of the contracts the bank lost money on. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The Hovnanian trade was devised and executed after Mr. Shah left GSO, but the senior GSO executive who made use of his former colleague's manufactured default template has now also left the firm, joining a rival distressed debt fund at the start of the year. Mr. Shah says he left to set up his own hedge fund in London to focus on smaller distressed debt opportunities. His new fund, Kyma Capital, is in the early stages of fundraising. \"The reason for leaving was simple: the European stressed and distressed opportunity set is a middle-market opportunity set,\" he says. \"These sized companies don't lend themselves to megafunds.\" Kyma Capital said it would \"welcome any regulatory changes that would improve the stability, durability and liquidity of the CDS markets\". But experts believe the damage to the market is already done, as the run of trades from GSO have exposed how easy it is for big players to alter outcomes in the very markets they are betting on. \"This kind of 'gaming' behaviour undermines the viability of the CDS market,\" says Henry Hu, a professor and expert in derivatives at the University of Texas Law School. \"The CDS market has shrunk terribly since the crisis. If this kind of behaviour continues, the market will shrink even further.\" \"We have heard with concern reports about recent 'manufactured' credit events,\" says a spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority. \"Such behaviour could also amount to market manipulation.\" Mr. Goelman, formerly of the CFTC, says he did look at manufactured defaults before stepping down last year, but could not say who was involved. \"For a number of different reasons, we decided to not act on the case.\" One of the hedge fund managers who came up against Mr. Shah says he expects GSO to now shy away from such trades, given the potential regulatory scrutiny. \"There are still going to be other guys out there who will be more aggressive and willing to put on these trades,\" he says, adding that it would be hard for others to replicate the intricacy of the trades pioneered by GSO. \"Being outside the behemoth of Blackstone, I don't see how that's going to work.\" More from the Financial Times:

Tepper, whose hedge fund owns just 1 percent of the drugmaker's shares, is pushing for a management overhaul days after CEO Brent Saunders outlined a plan to sell Allergan's women's health and infectious disease businesses. The plan resulted from a strategic review that also looked at splitting up the company or doing acquisitions. \"It is time for Allergan's management to concentrate on running a world class pharmaceutical and aesthetics business and forego thoughts of, or the exhilaration from, an ambitious acquisition strategy,\" Tepper wrote in a letter to Allergan's board. The letter was also signed by Douglas Silverman of Senator Investment Group. \"We were underwhelmed by the Company's half-hearted attempt to restore strategic momentum,\" the letter said. Allergan shares rose 0.7 percent Tuesday but are down more than 6 percent year to date. In a statement, Allergan said its board and management \"welcome\" input from shareholders and take their views into account, but it didn't address Tepper's demands for management change. Instead, it said its recently concluded strategic review was designed to create a \"more focused\" Allergan. It has added three new directors since the beginning of last year and prioritizes \"board refreshment.\" \"Our number one priority continues to be executing on operational excellence and delivering strong results to drive long term shareholder value,\" the statement said.

The recent death of a Chinese rural bank's chairman has put the spotlight on the troubles that small lenders in the country face as authorities clean up the financial sector in the world's second-largest economy. Yin Jinbao, who was reportedly found dead in his office on May 26 with slits on both his wrists, joined the board of Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank in July 2017 and became chairman in November. Before that, he was a director at Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank for four years. Local state media said police had ruled out homicide in their initial investigation of Yin's death. CNBC reached out to Tianjin police for comment, but has not heard back. Both the banks Yin worked at are controlled by the local government in Tianjin, a port city in northeastern China that's home to around 15.5 million people. Rural commercial banks are a category of small lenders in the country set up to support the agriculture sector and small and micro firms in the rural areas. Yin's suspected suicide came at a time when Chinese authorities have stepped up their inspection at troubled state-controlled companies. A May 2 notice by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said investigation teams had been dispatched to 22 state firms in Tianjin, including the two banks at which Yin worked. show chapters Chinese banks could face pressure ahead: Fitch 1:44 AM ET Mon, 27 Nov 2017 | 01:51 Several reports by Chinese media outlets suggested Yin's death could be related to the ongoing probe. Caixin Global, for one, quoted a source close to Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank saying Yin \"could not bear the pressure of the investigation once problems began to surface.\" Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank and Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment. The 2017 annual reports of both lenders revealed above-average levels of bad loans and the struggle to remain financially strong. Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank reported a 9.3 percent fall in revenue in 2017 but its net profit jumped 21.9 percent. Tianjin Binhai fared worse: Its revenue and net profit slumped by 46.3 percent and 41.8 percent, respectively. Bad debt was 2.48 percent of overall loans at Tianjin, and 2.29 percent at Tianjin Binhai \u2014 higher than the national level of 1.74 percent for 2017. Troubles facing small banks in China The banks' financial standing contrasted with larger peers such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which saw profitability and asset quality improve last year as China doubled down on efforts to cut excessive debt and risky financial undertakings. \"The main takeaway from FY17 is that size matters especially in the context of efforts to reduce systemic debt and financial risk,\" analysts from CreditSights wrote in an April note after China's listed banks reported their 2017 earnings. They explained that larger banks have a more stable base of deposits and can choose to lend to companies with stronger finances. Meanwhile, many small banks borrow at high interest rates from their mega peers for funding and have more exposure to risky shadow activities. show chapters The investment case for Chinese banks 1:51 AM ET Thu, 29 March 2018 | 02:54 Both Tianjin and Tianjin Binhai are small, private companies very rarely covered by research houses and rating agencies. Details of their business activities are therefore scarce, but the latter made headlines several times over the last few years for its financial problems. In 2014, the bank had illegally used company money to buy off-balance sheet asset management products issued by Hengfeng bank, according to a report by Caixin Global. It was also one of the creditors for Bohai Steel Group, which struggled with its 192 billion yuan ($29.95 billion) debt. Rural commercial banks such as Tianjin and Tianjin Binhai account for 13 to 14 percent of the total assets and liabilities in China's banking system, according to statistics by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. They may be small, but they could pose risks to China's economic progress, a Financial Times opinion piece noted in May. Such banks depend highly on their local economy to keep their businesses going. Tianjin province, for its part, recorded the smallest growth among China's 29 municipalities and regions last year. It grew 3.6 percent in 2017, which was down sharply from the 9 percent in the previous year.

President Donald Trump is \"very seriously contemplating\" separate trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Tuesday. It's not clear whether pursuing bilateral trade agreements with the two countries would effectively end the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place for more than two decades. \"Yesterday we met with the president a couple times and he is very seriously contemplating kind of a shift in NAFTA negotiations,\" Kudlow said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"His preference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately.\" show chapters Kudlow: US would welcome talks about unfair trading practices 10:31 AM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 02:56 \"I think the important thought here is he may be moving quickly towards these bilateral discussions instead of as a whole,\" Kudlow said. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso fell on Tuesday vs. the U.S. dollar in the wake of the comments from Kudlow. A Canadian government official pointed out this was not the first time the Trump administration has suggested a bilateral, rather than multilateral, approach. The White House and Mexican government did not immediately respond to CNBC emails for comment. Canada and Mexico are the second and third-largest trading partners of the U.S., respectively. On Friday, Trump said he \"wouldn't mind\" separate negotiations with the two countries.

In reaction, Canada last week proposed tariffs on a range of goods, including ball-point pens, toilet paper and maple sugar. Mexico said Tuesday it will impose tariffs of 15 to 25 percent on U.S. steel products, a 20 percent tariff on U.S. pork legs and shoulders, apples and potatoes and 20 to 25 percent duties on types of cheese and bourbon. \"Canada's a different country than Mexico.

Rather, he suggests, it's the bull market's main event right now. \"There's such focus on large cap, S&P 500 and Dow 30 stocks that often times investors forget about the historical outperformance that could be provided from owning mid-cap and small-cap stocks,\" Stoltzfus said Monday. \"Investors still have good reason to be positive on equities.\" The Russell 2000 index of small caps hit a fresh record high Monday. It's now up nearly 8 percent this year while the Dow, which got hit with two corrections this year, is virtually flat. According to Stoltzfus, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which closed at a record high on Monday and has rallied more than 10 percent this year, also signals the bull market is firmly in place. \"It is right in the trend of where we are experiencing growth \u2014 not only in the U.S. but around the world,\" he added. Stoltzfus acknowledged that geopolitical risks such as U.S.-China trade tensions could continue to bruise the broader markets in the near term. But he's sticking with his S&P 500 year-end target of 3,000, a nearly 9 percent gain from current levels. \"We would expect that if we get a positive resolution into these trade negotiations, even if it's just progress and not perfection,\" Stoltzfus said. \"We think the markets could rally much higher than where they have rallied to so far.\" He urges investors to be well diversified and nimble \u2014 giving technology, consumer discretionary, industrials and financials \"outperform\" ratings.

Despite bitcoin's price decline this year, a cryptocurrency \"mining\" company is moving ahead with plans to repurpose a 1,300 acre plot once used by Alcoa for aluminum smelting. Coinmint said Tuesday it would invest up to $700 million in the upstate New York location, which it expects to be the biggest bitcoin mining center in the world. The project will create an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months. After Alcoa shuttered its aluminum smelting operation there four years ago, the company was looking for a tenant. Following some back and forth and a few months of discussions, Coinmint said it signed a 10 year lease with options to renew. show chapters Bitcoin mining firms getting pushback from New York State 2:32 PM ET Fri, 16 March 2018 | 00:39 Since they penned a deal, bitcoin prices have dropped about 30 percent and are down nearly 50 percent this year, according to data from CoinDesk. \"As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,\" said Coinmint's Chief Technology Office Prieur Leary. \"We've developed a process to get an edge in the market.\" Part of that process was the move to Massena New York, just south of the Canadian border. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":506,\"200\":453,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-AZFrh\"),window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"AZFrh\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); The town has access to clean and cheaper power alternatives like hydroelectric and wind. Leary pointed out that each computer used to \"mine\" generates 1400 watts \u2014 the same as one hairdryer. With hundreds of thousands of these hot machines operating at once, upstate New York's climate is ideal for reducing air-conditioning costs. Cryptocurrency \"mining\" is essentially math done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what's known as a \"distributed ledger.\" In return for solving equations \"miners\" receive bitcoin. Operations are already underway at the former Alcoa East Facility complex, and are projected to be at full capacity within a year. The 435 Megawatt mining center is expected to be the world's largest digital currency data processor, based on capacity, Coinmint said. Most of Coinmint's competitors are overseas. Bitmain is the leader in the industry, and raked in record profits as bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. The Chinese company likely made as much $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, according to Bernstein analysts estimates. Coinmint is looking to hire around-the-clock staff, and plans to tap the local community to hire staff from security personnel to electricians, to highly- trained IT staff. \"We in Massena, would like to welcome Coinmint to our town,\" Steve O'Shaughnessy, Massena Town Supervisor said in a statement Tuesday. \"The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for.

Chanos, who teaches a course on the history of financial fraud at Yale University, says the mania around cryptocurrency following bitcoin's rise near $20,000 last year fits into what he calls the \"fraud cycle.\" Bitcoin has been compared it to \"digital gold,\" because some see it as a store of value, and it has a limited supply. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told CNBC in an interview this week that he \"totally buys into\" that comparison and the phrase \"pure digital gold.\" Chanos challenged that store-of-value case, saying that in an \"apocalypse\" food would actually function better as a currency. \"In the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,\" Chanos said. \"The last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\" Others see bitcoin as a viable currency, with no lender of last resort or third party adjudicator. While it can be used to transact, it's more appealing to those looking to dodge government oversight, he said. \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions,\" said Chanos, who founded New York-based Kynikos Associates. \"That's one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\" Some fraudsters have been emboldened by the fundraising craze known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The SEC has cracked down on the process with subpoenas and charges against some celebrity-backed projects this year. ICOs raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to the most recent research firm Autonomous Next. \"I suspect going forward we're going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging,\" Chanos said. The short-seller has rallied against bitcoin before, calling it \"speculative mania.\" \"It's Beanie Babies,\" he said at a Schechter event in Detroit, Michigan, referring to the collectible toy craze during the 1990s.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has picked a new leader for its emerging cryptocurrency division. Valerie Szczepanik, who already worked at the SEC, was promoted to a role that didn't exist until this week: Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation. Szczepanik, who joined the agency in 1997, will \"coordinate efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrencies,\" the SEC said in a statement. The new role is emerging at a key time for the SEC. The financial watchdog is balancing on consumer protection and innovation in what has become multi-billion dollar market. Szczepanik was most recently Assistant Director in the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. She is currently head of the SEC's Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group, co-head of its Dark Web Working Group, and a member of its FinTech Working Group. Before the SEC, she served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and clerked for federal judges on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton called Szczepanik \"the right person to coordinate our efforts in this dynamic area that has both promise and risk.\" Szczepanik received a law degree from Georgetown University and a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. The issue of how to classify a cryptocurrency has been a major point for the agency and cryptocurrency exchanges. The SEC's Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities. But companies tied to cryptocurrencies have maintained that some should be fall under a different category because of their utility and stark differences from stocks. The agency has warned investors of pump-and-dump schemes, shut multiple down, and charged some backed by celebrities with fraud. In May, the regulator created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. Bitcoin prices have plummeted this year. The flagship cryptocurrency is down roughly 50 percent in 2018 after climbing more than 1,300 percent last year. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and other pundits have predicted that institutional investors entering the market could boost liquidity and stagnant prices. But that money seems to be waiting for more guidance from regulators. \"At the moment we're in purgatory with regard to regulatory clarity and I think that's going to keep institutions on the sidelines,\" Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" Monday.

Money management firm VanEck is trying again for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. On this third attempt, the company is teaming up with blockchain company SolidX and basing the fund on actual bitcoins rather than futures. Each share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The high price reflects the fund's focus on institutional, rather than retail, investors, SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy said in a phone interview with CNBC. If all regulatory filings go through according to plan, the ETF should launch by sometime in the first quarter of 2019, Gallancy said. The fund will track a bitcoin index from VanEck's subsidiary MVIS that uses prices from over-the-counter trades rather than electronic cryptocurrency exchanges. It's not clear whether the structure of the ETF or bitcoin's relative stability recently will help the fund gain approval. Several companies, including VanEck, have tried unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States. show chapters SEC chairman: Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not securities 3:32 PM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 | 04:27 VanEck first filed for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August, but withdrew the application in September at the request of SEC staff since the futures didn't exist yet. The company and several other firms filed again when bitcoin futures launched on CME and Cboe in December. But they had to withdraw those applications in January at the request of SEC staff. In a letter that month, the commission raised concerns such as extreme price volatility and the ability for customers to withdraw funds easily. The SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Bitcoin traded near $7,500 on Wednesday, holding within the trading range of the last few months. SolidX has also struggled to launch a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company's application for an exchange-traded product based on physical bitcoins. Around the same time, the commission also rejected, then said it would review, the Winklevoss twins' proposal for a similar bitcoin fund. VanEck will help market the new bitcoin ETF, SolidX will sponsor or create the underlying index and Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian, the filing said.

"body": " Regulators need to do more to allow new technologies that could help in the fight against money laundering, as financial institutions are struggling with ever-growing compliance costs, an Asia finance industry group said on Thursday. Banks have been slapped with vast sums for not preventing money being laundered through their accounts, and the call for action comes after Commonwealth Bank of Australia last week was fined a record $530 million for breaching money laundering and terror financing laws. The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said it would like to see greater use of new technologies in \"know your client\" or KYC anti-money laundering checks, as they promise to drastically cut costs. \"Fintech solutions, facial recognition for example, hold out great hope for the industry, but haven't been embraced as quickly as some might like by regulators around the world,\" said Mark Austen, chief executive of the association. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore said last year they were exploring whether KYC utilities, central repositories of data that banks can tap to save duplication when adding new clients, should be set up. But the process is taking time amid concerns about who would have liability when data was wrong. Grappling with compliance and the costs involved has become a onerous task for most banks and brokerages. In 2017, the number of employees working on KYC compliance in financial institutions reached an average of 307, jumping from just 68 a year earlier, the association said in its report. HSBC alone spent $3 billion last year on compliance. It tripled its compliance headcount between 2013 and 2017 and now employs 8,600 compliance staff. \"Whether KYC and AML (anti-money laundering) headcount will fall comes down to whether the institutions can automate - there are a lot trying to as it means they can cut costs and probably actually improve compliance,\" Austen added. The association called on its members to help regulators understand developments and harmonize standards as different KYC rules across the region raised costs for cross-border financial groups, who were also interpreting those rules in different ways. \"It would be good if financial institutions in Asia at least all thought about the issues around KYC in a similar way,\" said Will Haslet, partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, which contributed to the report. \"When we talk about the longer term solution of technology, consistency is necessary.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/07/105255758-GettyImages-845906712.jpg?v=1535002723", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": " Regulators"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Asia"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Thursday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Commonwealth Bank of Australia"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last week"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "a record $530 million"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Fintech"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Mark Austen"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Monetary Authority of Singapore"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2017"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "307"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "just 68 a year earlier"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HSBC"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$3 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "between 2013 and 2017"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "8,600"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "AML"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Austen"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "LOC", "term": "Asia"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "KYC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Will Haslet"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Herbert Smith Freehills"}], "description": "Banks have been slapped with vast sums for not doing enough to prevent money being laundered through their accounts.

The agency is not adjusting rules for the fundraising process known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs, either, he said. ICOs have raised $9.1 billion this year alone, according to the latest research from Autonomous Next. \"If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,\" Clayton said, \"If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us.\" The SEC is \"happy to help you do that public offering\" if issuers take the responsibility SEC laws require, he said. The chairman also addressed a growing debate over which cryptocurrencies should fall under SEC jurisdiction. \"Cryptocurrencies: These are replacements for sovereign currencies, replace the dollar, the euro, the yen with bitcoin,\" Clayton said. \"That type of currency is not a security.\" A token, or a digital asset used in a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, are securities by Clayton's definition. \"A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say 'you can get a return' that is a security and we regulate that,\" Clayton said. \"We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.\" Whether an asset is a security right now follows the \"Howey Test.\" The ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts. Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities, and reiterated that Wednesday saying \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" But companies tied to those cryptocurrencies have argued that some should fall under a different category, in many cases because of their utility. The financial watchdog has been balancing consumer protection and innovation in what has become multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency market. The market capitalization of bitcoin alone is more than $130 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the SEC picked a new leader for its emerging cryptocurrency division. Valerie Szczepanik, who already worked at the agency, was promoted to a role that didn't exist until this week: Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation. Bitcoin began its price descent in March, falling below $10,000 after the agency said it would require digital asset exchanges to register with the agency. Prices have struggled to recover since. Bitcoin is down roughly 50 percent in 2018 after climbing more than 1,300 percent last year, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency was trading near $7,628 as of 5 p.m ET Wednesday. Bitcoin's three-month performance Source: CoinDesk In late April, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson told CNBC the agency was not looking to ban the fundraising process known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs, and remains open to a legal avenue for crypto investments. One month later, the SEC created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. The agency has cracked down on ICOs year: It has continuously warned of pump-and-dump schemes, issued subpoenas and charged multiple coin projects with fraud. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and other bitcoin pundits have predicted that institutional investors need more guidance from regulators like the SEC until they fully buy into crypto. Lee told CNBC this week that investors are in \"purgatory with regard to regulatory clarity.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/26/104732454-GettyImages-656907770-jay-clayton.jpg?v=1538139120", "keywords": [{"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "3:32 PM ET"}, {"category": "CARDINAL", "term": "6"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "June 2018"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "04:27"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Securities and Exchange Commission"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Jay Clayton"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "GPE", "term": "U.S."}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$19 trillion"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "$9.1 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this year alone"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Autonomous Next"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "ICO"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "WORK_OF_ART", "term": "Howey Test"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "1946"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "U.S. Supreme Court"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Clayton"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "March"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "multibillion-dollar"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "more than $130 billion"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Tuesday"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Valerie Szczepanik"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this week"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "the Division of Corporation Finance"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Digital Assets"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "Innovation"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "March"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "below $10,000"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "roughly 50 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "2018"}, {"category": "PERCENT", "term": "more than 1,300 percent"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "last year"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CoinDesk"}, {"category": "MONEY", "term": "7,628"}, {"category": "TIME", "term": "5 p.m ET"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "Wednesday"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Bitcoin"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "three-month"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "late April"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Robert Jackson"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "One month later"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "HoweyCoins.com"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "ICOs year"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Tom Lee"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "SEC"}, {"category": "PERSON", "term": "Lee"}, {"category": "ORG", "term": "CNBC"}, {"category": "DATE", "term": "this week"}], "description": "The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission made it clear Wednesday that the agency won't bend the rules for cryptocurrency when it comes to defining what is or what isn't a security.

Revolut doubled its user count just months after it said it had passed the 1 million user mark in November 2017. Its planned commission-free trading service would compete with the likes of the U.K.'s Trading212 and U.S. firm Robinhood. \"For many years, people have felt frozen out of trading by high fees and clunky interfaces, so Revolut are aiming to make investments cheap, simple and completely mobile,\" Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's co-founder and chief executive, told CNBC. The company has widened its product offering into new areas such as cryptocurrency and savings as of late. It started out predominantly as a money management app offering currency exchange at the live currency conversion rate and has since signaled further expansion into banking by offering current accounts and last year applied for a European banking license. \"While the cryptocurrency feature has definitely played a part in our growth, our financial marketplace of products have also helped hugely in enticing people to join Revolut,\" Storonsky said. Revolut's marketplace gives users access to insurance and credit products from a variety of providers, similar to a feature offered by rival fintech firm Starling. It is currently only available in Europe, and is most widely used in the U.K. The firm is looking to expand its presence to the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand within months. Revolut Revolut's commission-free trading platform \"Wealth.\" Revolut said it expects to launch the trading platform next year and is in the preliminary stages of building it. The service will be available to all of its customers, including those in the new markets it plans to expand to. The firm counts itself among several of Europe's so-called challenger banks \u2014 predominantly digital banks looking to compete with larger lenders. German challenger bank N26 recently announced it has 1 million users signed up to its platform. Revolut generates $2 billion a month in transaction volume, while N26 has a monthly transaction volume of $1.17 billion. Storonsky said Revolut was not concerned by such fintech competitors because it expects its main competition to come from tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. \"They have huge amounts of customer data, capital and employees that can help them to easily begin breaking into the banking space,\" he said. Revolut recently joined the ranks of Europe's unicorns by surpassing $1 billion in market value after a $250 million investment led by venture capital firm DST Global.

Ukraine has mired itself in political drama ahead of a crucial vote, the result of which will determine Kiev's access to a financial lifeline. Lawmakers in the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, will vote Thursday on the creation of an anti-corruption court, a key condition of unlocking the country's $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout that's been frozen since last year. Delivery of the funds has been repeatedly put on hold as Kiev struggles to enact the IMF's required reforms, which include the anti-corruption measures and raising household gas prices. A failure to get enough votes for the anti-corruption court \u2014 something Ukrainian politicians have been fighting about publicly, and more fiercely behind closed doors \u2014 could tip the nation into deeper uncertainty and send investors running for the door. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman has threatened to resign if the vote is not passed and all IMF conditions are not met, although he has opposed the hike on gas prices. Ukraine's central bank has highlighted IMF financing delays as \"the key\" risk to its financial stability. The eastern European nation of 45 million has a national interest rate of 17 percent \u2014 the highest in Europe \u2014 and rates are only set to be pushed higher if help from the IMF does not materialize. Inflation, too, remains stubbornly high at 13.1 percent. Four years after mass protests erupted to remove then-President Viktor Yanukovych from power, Ukrainians citizens and international investors are frustrated at an economy that's remained troubled and steeped in corruption. Transparency International ranked Ukraine 130 out of 180 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2017. Genya Savilov | AFP | Getty Images Speaker of Ukrainian Parliament Volodymyr Groysman (R) has been nominated by President Petro Poroshenko's party to head the future cabinet. Ukraine restructured its debt in 2015 following its sovereign debt crisis triggered by conflict with Russia in 2014, leaving it with large annual payments to make between 2019 and 2027. Its foreign currency reserves are at roughly half the level they were before the crisis. Political infighting Meanwhile, Groysman and his finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk have been in an open spat over the naming of appointees, with the latter having sent a letter to his G7 counterparts complaining that nepotism and political corruption continue to dominate Ukraine. On Wednesday, Groysman asked the Rada to fire Danylyuk \u2014 who's been seen as a major reformer \u2014 for misconduct. \"I am sure that lawmakers would be delighted to vote the reform-minded Danylyuk out of office,\" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management. Ukraine managed to successfully sell $3 billion in dollar bonds in 2017, helping mitigate a bit of its debt burden, but the recent sell-off in emerging markets is making borrowing costs far more expensive. The Institute for International Finance recently named Ukraine among the five most vulnerable emerging markets to a strengthening dollar and rate rises. It currently has more than $20 billion in outstanding dollar debt. \"Should the vote fail, it will likely exclude additional IMF support for the foreseeable future while also drawing further negative attention to the government,\" said Maximilian Hess, a senior political risk analyst at London-based consultancy AKE Group. This combined with the Danylyuk-Groysman feud, and a potential stricture on Ukraine's ability to sell Eurobonds the way it did last year, could cripple the country's ability to tap the private debt market for its financing needs, Hess said. Andrew Burton | Getty Images Ukraine's economy has been in turmoil ever since the Euromaidan protests in 2014 that triggered Russian annexation of its Crimean peninsula and a war with Russian-backed forces in the country's east that has engulfed 7 percent of its territory and killed more than 11,000 people. \"While Ukraine maybe \u2014 emphasis on maybe \u2014 could meet its debt obligations in 2019-20, a new sovereign debt crisis is entirely possible, particularly if additional IMF support is not forthcoming,\" Hess said. \"Rising interest rates, the continued conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and uncertainty around the elections and about further loans or guarantees from the EU and other Western partners mean that concerns over the sustainability of Ukraine's state debts could return rapidly.\" ", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/12/18/104174378-GettyImages-479359757.jpg?v=1482102575",

Qualcomm Inc. Former Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs is starting a new company with two ex-Qualcomm executives that will focus on next-generation wireless technology. The start-up engineering company, called XCOM, will invest and develop technologies to tackle important 5G problems, such as low latency and greater reliability. Jacobs is the new company's CEO and chairman and is joined by Derek Aberle, Qualcomm's former president who left the company last year, and Matthew Grob, who served as Qualcomm's chief technology officer from 2011 to 2017. The new company doesn't interrupt Jacobs' plans to take Qualcomm private. Jacobs is working with Aberle to raise billions of dollars for a theoretical Qualcomm acquisition. Those efforts, while ongoing, have temporarily slowed as Qualcomm waits to see if it will get Chinese approval to acquire NXP. \"It's unclear where the take private plan will go or how long that will take,\" said Aberle in an interview. \"But this is not an either/or. We are pursuing this new company and we have high expectations and confidence in the take-private plan.\" Aberle said he didn't have anything to report on money raised to take Qualcomm private. show chapters Jacobs may step down from Qualcomm board, says Dow Jones 11:21 AM ET Fri, 16 March 2018 | 00:50 Jacobs, Aberle and Grob plan on hiring more people for XCOM in the coming months, said Aberle. They are toying with ideas to license proprietary 5G technology or provide software and designs to other companies to use in their semiconductors, he said. The company is still in such early stages that the executives don't yet have a fleshed out business model, he said. \"There's still a fair amount of work that needs to be done to prove out the applicability of 5G through various Internet of Things applications,\" Aberle said. \"We feel we have some better ideas for how to do some of that stuff.\" If the take-private does happen, the company's technology could be used in Qualcomm chips or the entity could be rolled into Qualcomm, Aberle said. Jacobs' father, Irwin, was a co-founder of Qualcomm, and Paul Jacobs rose through the ranks to become CEO from 2005 through 2014.

President Ronald Reagan's Office of Management and Budget director blames a bull market that's getting longer in the tooth \u2014 paired with headwinds ranging from President Donald Trump's leadership to fiscal policy decisions to questionable earnings. \"I call this a daredevil market. It's all risk and very little reward in the path ahead,\" Stockman said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"This market is just way, way over-priced for reality.\" His thoughts came as the Nasdaq was reaching all-time highs again, while S&P 500 rose slightly but the Dow failed to extend its win streak to three days in a row. \"The S&P 500 could easily drop to 1,600 because earnings could drop to $75 a share the next time we have a recession,\" Stockman warned. \"We're about eight or nine years into this expansion. Everything is crazily priced. I mean the S&P 500 at 24 times at the end, tippy top of a business cycle.\" One of his biggest gripes with the bulls is the notion that President Donald Trump's tax cuts are providing a fundamental lift to stocks. \"These tax cuts are going to add to the deficit in the 10th year of an expansion. It's just irresponsible crazy,\" he said. \"It's all going to stock buybacks and M&A deals anyway. That doesn't cause the economy to grow. It's just a short-term boost to the stock market that doesn't last.\" Stockman has made similar bearish calls in the past, but they haven't materialized. Yet, he's not backing down. \"There are some huge surprises lurking out there because we've had eight years of monetary expansion that is just off the charts of history,\" he said. When pressed for when a massive sell-off could hit stocks, he didn't give a time frame. \"When the catalyst finally comes, it's hard to say,\" Stockman said. \"No one can ever define what the black swan is because that is why it's called a black swan.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Tesla stock closed Wednesday up 9.7 percent at $319.50 per share, meaning investors who sold the stock short lost a collective $1.07 billion in a single day, estimates S3. Tesla bears have lost nearly $5 billion in mark-to-market losses since 2016, S3's head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told CNBC. Tesla shorts mark-to-market losses, in millions Source: Ihor Dusaniwsky, Head of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners Chairman and CEO Elon Musk got a vote of confidence from shareholders at the company's annual meeting Tuesday. Musk also told shareholders it is \"extremely likely\" Tesla will hit a weekly Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars by the end of the month. Tesla has been struggling with production issues and faces concerns about its finances. Tesla is the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., as well as the most heavily shorted automaker in the world. Short interest, or the number of shares borrowed in hopes of buying them back at a profit after the stock drops, totals $9.03 billion for Tesla, according to S3. That's about $1.6 billion larger than second-place Amazon's short interest. Source: Ihor Dusaniwsky, Head of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners \"Shorts are actually covering slightly since the beginning of last month,\" Dusaniwsky said. Shorting Tesla is costing investors \"over $1 million in financing a day to keep up,\" Dusaniwsky added, as the fee investors pay to bet against the stock is at about 3.5 percent. At the beginning of this year, that fee was only about 1 percent, according to Dusaniwsky. By April the short fee had jumped, hitting 3 percent and higher, he said. \u2014 CNBC's Tom Franck contributed to this report.
