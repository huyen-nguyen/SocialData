In the quantum optics group at Caltech, we are attempting to lay the foundations for quantum information science by way of advances on several fronts in optical physics. Within the setting of cavity QED, single atoms are strongly coupled to the field of a high finesse optical cavity at the single photon level, with current work directed toward trapping and localization of atoms inside the cavity. Although there are daunting technical problems to overcome, a principal scientific objective is the creation of quantum networks to implement fundamental quantum communication protocols and for distributed quantum computation. Beyond quantum information processing with internal atomic states and photons serving as qubits, we are also investigating algorithms for continuous quantum variables. A recent example is our realization of quantum teleportation for the quadrature amplitudes of a beam of light. The experiment utilizes squeezed-state entanglement to achieve unconditional quantum teleportation.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807377","","Quantum computing;Optical computing;Atom optics;Teleportation;Information science;Physics;Optical coupling;Charge carrier processes;Protocols;Computer networks","quantum communication;quantum optics;quantum computing;quantum electrodynamics;radiation pressure;optical squeezing","quantum communication;quantum computation;quantum optics;quantum information science;cavity QED;strongly coupled single atoms;high finesse optical cavity field;localization of atoms;trapping of atoms;quantum networks;distributed computation;internal atomic states;photon qubits;continuous quantum variables;algorithms;quantum teleportation;quadrature amplitudes;squeezed-state entanglement","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We give a theoretical description of how a prototype quantum computer using a single dot would function. The basic element of a quantum computer is represented by a quantum unit of information, or qubit. In our case, the presence and absence of the exciton in a quantum dot constitutes a qubit and the up and down spin excitons in the same dot yield two qubits with a strong mutual interaction.

Single-photon sources have recently been demonstrated using a variety of devices, including molecules, mesoscopic quantum wells, colour centers, trapped ions, and semiconductor quantum dots. These sources rarely emit two or more photons in the same pulse, compared to a Poisson-distributed source of the same intensity. Numerous applications for single-photon sources have been proposed in the field of quantum information. However, most, including linear-optical quantum computation, also require that consecutive photons have identical wave packets. For a source based on a single quantum emitter, the emitter must therefore be excited in a rapid or deterministic way, and interact little with its surrounding environment. Here, we test the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity through a Hong-Ou-Mandel-type two-photon interference experiment. We find that consecutive photons are largely indistinguishable, with a mean wave-packet overlap as large as 0.81, making this source useful in a variety of experiments in quantum optics and quantum information.","","0-7803-7733","10.1109/EQEC.2003.1314174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1314174","","Quantum dots;US Department of Transportation;Stimulated emission;Optical computing;Quantum computing;Instruction sets;USA Councils;Laboratories;Optical pulses;Particle beam optics","semiconductor quantum dots;quantum computing;microcavities;two-photon processes;light interferometry;quantum optics;light sources","quantum dot single photon sources;linear-optical quantum computation;wave packets;single quantum emitter;microcavity;Hong-Ou-Mandel-type two-photon interference experiment;quantum optics;quantum information","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last few years, significant progress has been made towards the realization of basic QCA elements. However, in these devices, power gain needed for the operation of large QCA arrays was not possible since the only source of energy was the signal input. Recent theoretical work (Lent and Tougaw, 1997) proposed clocked control of the QCA circuitry. Clocked controlled QCA systems have many advantages such as power gain, reduced power dissipation, and pipelined architectures. The original theoretical work applied only to semiconductor implementation of clocked QCA arrays, but recently a scheme for clocked control of metallic QCA cells was proposed (Toth and Lent, 1999; Korotkov and Likharev, 1998). Here an extra dot placed between the two dots of the QCA half-cell acts as a tunable barrier controlled by the clock signal. We present the experimental demonstration of a clocked QCA cell.

This coupling scheme is simple and can be readily extended to many-qubit circuits required for scalable quantum information processing.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/TASC.2005.850074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1439767","Coupled SQUID flux qubits;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;two-bit gates","Quantum entanglement;SQUIDs;Quantum computing;Superconducting microwave devices;Josephson junctions;Schrodinger equation;Superconducting device noise;Resonance;Control systems;Coupling circuits","quantum gates;superconducting logic circuits;SQUIDs;Schrodinger equation;quantum entanglement","quantum entanglement;controlled logical gates;coupled SQUID flux qubits;universal two-bit quantum gates;inductively coupled SQUIDs;quantum logical gates;resonant microwave pulse;controlled-NOT gate;coupled qubits;time-dependent Schrodinger equation","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the search for a new paradigm to achieve speeds and densities well beyond the foreseen limits of CMOS, a new model of device design using charge state and Coulomb interaction for information storage and propagation has been proposed. This paradigm of computation, based on Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), provides a natural approach to the design of molecules that can encode and propagate binary information in their charge configurations. We investigate the properties of potential QCA molecules, using quantum mechanical calculations in the local density approximation. Specifically, the switching of a two-state cell with an appropriate driver charge is shown. Calculations of experimentally accessible molecular properties are investigated, and further details of molecular cell bistability are explored.","","0-7803-7014","10.1109/DRC.2001.937916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937916","","Quantum mechanics;Quantum cellular automata;Mechanical factors;CMOS technology;Computer architecture;Silicon;Scalability;Energy dissipation;Semiconductor device modeling;Quantum computing","molecular electronics;quantum theory;cellular automata;quantum computing","computer architecture;integrated silicon CMOS technology;energy dissipation;device design;charge state;Coulomb interaction;information storage;quantum cellular automata;molecules;binary information;QCA molecules;quantum mechanical calculations;local density approximation;switching;two-state cell;driver charge;molecular properties;molecular cell bistability","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sci., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA","Proceedings 17th IEEE Annual Conference on Computational Complexity","","2002","","","19","","Shared entanglement is a resource available to parties communicating over a quantum channel, much akin to public coins in classical communication protocols: the two parties may be given some number of quantum bits jointly prepared in a fixed superposition, prior to communicating with each other. The quantum channel is then said to be ""entanglement-assisted."" Shared randomness does not help in the transmission of information from one party to another. Moreover, it does not significantly reduce the classical complexity of computing functions vis-a-vis private-coin protocols. On the other hand, prior entanglement leads to startling phenomena such as ""quantum teleportation"" and ""superdense coding."" The problem of characterising the power of prior entanglement has baffled many researchers, especially in the setting of bounded-error protocols. It is open whether it leads to more than a factor of two savings (using superdense coding) or more than an additive O(log) savings (when used to create shared randomness). Few lower bounds are known for communication problems in this setting, and are all derived using sophisticated information theoretic techniques. In this paper, we focus on the most basic problem in the setting of communication over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel, that of communicating classical bits from one party to another. We derive optimal bounds on the number of quantum bits required for this task, for any given probability of error.","1093-0159","0-7695-1468","10.1109/CCC.2002.1004331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004331","","Quantum entanglement;Protocols;Quantum mechanics;Computer science;Mathematics;Quantum computing;Random variables;Complexity theory;Computational complexity","quantum communication;information theory;computational complexity","shared entanglement;entanglement-assisted quantum channel;communication;quantum bits;fixed superposition;shared randomness;prior entanglement;superdense coding;quantum teleportation;bounded-error protocols;lower bounds;information theory;optimal bounds;error probability","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far some impressive results have been obtained using quantum computers on current problems (e.g. search problems). Many quantum algorithms make use of the Hadamard gate, and a few use a more general form of that gate. In this paper we present a generalized quantum gate that can be shown to encapsulate the standard gates used in quantum algorithms and quantum information processing: Pauli X, Y, and Z, Hadamard, T phase shift, S phase shift, and identity.

These measures have a long history of use in statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other, one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential indistinguishability for two families of quantum states.

In this paper, we investigate the unique capabilities of the VLPC. The efficiency of the detector and cryogenic system is measured at 543 nm wavelengths to be 85%. A picosecond pulsed laser is then used to excite the detector with pulses having average photon numbers ranging from 3-5. The output of the VLPC is used to discriminate photon numbers in a pulse. The error probability for number state discrimination is an increasing function of the number of photons, due to buildup of multiplication noise. This puts an ultimate limit on the ability of the VLPC to do number state detection. For many applications, it is sufficient to discriminate between 1 and more than one detected photon.

We show how this model is related to NMR quantum computing, in which only statistical properties of an ensemble of quantum systems can be measured, and in particular to the question of whether one can translate standard quantum algorithms to the NMR setting without putting all of their classical postprocessing into the quantum system. Using Fourier analysis techniques developed in the related context of statistical query learning, we prove a number of lower bounds (both information-theoretic and cryptographic) on the ability of algorithms to produce an x/spl isin/S, even when the set S is fairly simple.

This fundamental research will allow one to synthesize, design, manufacture novel high-performance nanostructures, nanodevices (nanoscale actuators and sensors, nanoelectronics, nanoICs), and nanoelectromechanical systems. For example, biomolecular motors (kinesin-protein process and bacterial flagellar motor) transport substance at the nanoscale level within biological cells, and the motor-cargo connected tether is elastic allowing the motor to defuse rapidly. The energy is stored by the high-energy chemical bonds (proton gradient across the cell's inner membrane). In this paper we examine the coherence between Lagrangian and quantum mechanics as well as quantum optimization and control.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924","10.1109/CDC.2003.1271807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271807","","Quantum mechanics;Lagrangian functions;Nanobioscience;Micromotors;Nanostructures;Nanoelectronics;Research and development;Nanocomposites;Computational modeling;Analytical models","optimisation;quantum theory;quantum computing;nanoelectronics;Brownian motion;Schrodinger equation","Lagrangian optimization;quantum mechanics;quantum control;Brownian motor direction;quantum effects;nanoelectronics;nanocomposites;modeling;organic nanoscale systems;inorganic nanoscale systems;information processing;nanostructures;nanobiotechnology;biomaterials;biosystem based electronics;biologically inspired systems;biochemical process;electromagnetic process;mechanical process;nanodevices;nanoscale actuators;nanoscale sensors;nanoIC;nanoelectromechanical systems;biomolecular motors;kinesin-protein process;bacterial flagellar motor;biological cells;chemical bonds;proton gradient;Schrodinger equation","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimental techniques for measurement of the quantum state of light have been the subject of intensive investigation for some time. Tomographic techniques have been applied to experiments such as the homodyne measurement of the Wigner function of a single mode of light and of the density matrix of the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of entangled photons. In this technique, the density matrix (or Wigner function) which characterizes the quantum state of the system being measured is found from a linear transformation of experimental data. There are a number of drawbacks to the method, principally in that the recovered state might not, because of experimental noise, correspond to a physical state. For example, density matrices for any quantum state must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite matrices with unit trace. The tomographically measured matrices often fail to be positive semi-definite. To avoid this problem, the maximum likelihood approach to the estimation of quantum states has been developed. We evaluate two different approaches to the maximum likelihood technique, namely defining the likelihood function f as a weighted sum of squared variances from measured data, and defining it in terms of information content. These are compared with results of standard tomographical schemes.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.962166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962166","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Density measurement;Laboratories;Physics;Australia;Time measurement;Optical polarization;Single photon emission computed tomography;Ear;State estimation","maximum likelihood estimation;Wigner distribution;optical tomography;Hermitian matrices;light polarisation;homodyne detection;quantum optics","quantum state reconstruction;maximum likelihood schemes;tomographic schemes;light quantum state measurement;tomographic techniques;homodyne measurement;Wigner function;single light mode;density matrix;polarization degrees of freedom;entangled photon pair;quantum state;linear transformation;physical state;Hermitian positive semi-definite matrices;tomographically measured matrices;maximum likelihood estimation;likelihood function;weighted squared variance sum;information content","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Optical lattices provide new opportunities to create entangled states of neutral atoms for quantum information processing. Such systems have some attractive features: decoherence is suppressed because neutrals couple weakly to the environment, and operations can be performed in parallel on a large ensemble of trapped atoms, thus offering avenues for scaling to many qubits. The main source of decoherence is spontaneous emission, but this can be negligible if all manipulations are performed rapidly compared to the photon scattering rate.

"Prior entanglement, message compression and privacy in quantum communication","R. Jain; J. Radhakrishnan; P. Sen","UC Berkeley, CA, USA; NA; NA","20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","","2005","","","285","296","Consider a two-party quantum communication protocol for computing some function f : {0, 1}/sup n/ /spl times/ {0, 1}/sup n/ /spl rarr/ Z. We show that the first message of P can be compressed to 0(k) classical bits using prior entanglement if it carries at most k bits of information about the sender's input. This implies a general direct sum result for one-round and simultaneous quantum protocols. It also implies a new round elimination lemma in quantum communication, which allows us to extend recent classical lower bounds on the cell probe complexity of some data structure problems, e.g. approximate nearest neighbor searching on the Hamming cube {0, 1}/sup n/, to the quantum setting. We then show an optimal tradeoff between the privacy losses of Alice and Bob in computing f in terms of the one-round quantum communication complexity of f with prior entanglement. This tradeoff is independent of the number of rounds of communication. The above message compression and privacy tradeoff results use a lot of qubits of prior entanglement, leading one to wonder how much prior entanglement is really required by a quantum protocol. We show that Newman's [1991] technique of reducing the number of public coins in a classical protocol cannot be lifted to the quantum setting. We do this by defining a general notion of black-box reduction of prior entanglement that subsumes Newman's technique. Intuitively, a black-box reduction does not change the unitary transforms of Alice and Bob; it only decreases the amount of entanglement of the prior entangled state. We prove that such a black-box reduction is impossible for quantum protocols by exhibiting a particular one-round quantum protocol for the equality function where the black-box technique fails to reduce the amount of prior entanglement by more than a constant factor.","1093-0159","0-7695-2364","10.1109/CCC.2005.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443093","","Privacy;Quantum entanglement;Protocols;Quantum computing;Complexity theory;Military computing;Probes;Data structures;Nearest neighbor searches;Paramagnetic resonance","quantum communication;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;data compression;data privacy;communication complexity;cryptography;protocols","message compression;data privacy;two-party quantum communication protocol;prior entanglement;cell probe complexity;data structure;nearest neighbor searching;Hamming cube;privacy loss;communication complexity;privacy tradeoff;public coins;black-box reduction;unitary transforms;equality function","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using QCA, the innovative design of digital systems can be achieved by exploiting the so-called capability of processing-in-wire, i.e., signal manipulation proceeds at the same time as propagation. QCA systems require low power together with the potential for high density and regularity. These features make QCA an attractive technology for manufacturing memories in which the in-wire paradigm can be exploited for storage purposes. This paper proposes a novel parallel memory architecture for QCA implementation. This architecture is based on storing information on a QCA line by changing the direction of signal flow among three clocking zones. Timing of these zones requires two additional clocks to implement a four-step process for reading/writing data to the memory. Its operation has been verified by simulation. It is shown that the requirements for clocking, number of zones, as well as the underlying CMOS circuitry are significantly reduced compared with previous QCA parallel architectures.","1536-125X;1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2005.858589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528473","Emerging technologies;memory architecture;quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA);quantum computing","Quantum cellular automata;Clocks;Quantum dots;Nanotechnology;Signal design;Digital systems;Signal processing;Manufacturing;Memory architecture;Timing","parallel memories;quantum dots;cellular automata;nanotechnology;memory architecture;quantum computing;digital simulation;CMOS memory circuits","line-based parallel memory architecture;QCA implementation;quantum-dot cellular automata;nanotechnology;innovative design;digital systems;processing-in-wire;signal manipulation;signal flow;clocking zones;reading/writing data;CMOS circuitry;quantum computing","","47","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Studies range from the examination of quantum paradoxes to practical applications in optical measurements and quantum information. A standard source of entangled photons consists of a nonlinear crystal without a center of symmetry pumped by a highly coherent laser. This combination provides a medium for the generation of photon pairs that can be entangled in any number of variables: time, frequency, direction of propagation, and polarization. We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fourth-order coherence properties of entangled-photon states generated in a nonlinear optical medium comprising two separate nonlinear crystals pumped by the same highly coherent and monochromatic laser source. We demonstrate that the nature of the down-conversion process insures the existence of nonclassical correlations and stable phase relations (coherence) between the photons only in each pair and nor between pairs generated from physically distinct regions of nonlinear interaction. This result has been verified in a set of quantum-interference experiments without invoking any spectral filtering.","","0-7803-6318","10.1109/IQEC.2000.907995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=907995","","Quantum entanglement;Quantum cascade lasers;Photonic crystals;Nonlinear optics;Optical filters;Optical pumping;Laser excitation;Laser theory;Pump lasers;Frequency","optical parametric devices;optical frequency conversion;quantum optics;light coherence;nonlinear media","quantum incoherence;quantum entanglement;cascaded-crystal parametric down-conversion;entangled photon states;quantum paradoxes;optical measurements;quantum information;entangled photons;nonlinear crystal;photon pairs;fourth-order coherence properties;entangled-photon states;nonlinear optical medium;separate nonlinear crystals;coherent laser source;down-conversion process;nonclassical correlation;stable phase relations;coherence;nonlinear interaction;quantum-interference experiments;spectral filtering","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently the bound state of two-excitons (the biexciton) has been successfully created and studied using nonlinear spectroscopy. We report here high resolution coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy showing spectral features that are distinct from the biexcitonic features but similar to that expected for a coupled two exciton system.

The challenges this technology faces, however, are substantial: for example, control of the qubit to a part in /spl sim/10/sup 4/ must be accomplished with analog control pulses. But even after this is done, the accuracy is limited by the unavoidable decay of quantum information in the system. Recent experiments suggest the time over which this decay occurs is <1 /spl mu/s, though it is expected to lengthen as experimental methods improve. A 1-/spl mu/s decay time would mandate a very difficult to achieve maximum time of /spl sim/100 ps per analog operation.

This allows us to compute the probability values of various possible states at the output for various possible input probability distributions. Thus, the reliability of the circuit being modeled can be computed, in terms of the entropy at the entangled output. At the outset this might seem quite convoluted, but we argue in this paper that this model of computation provides an effective and compact way of reliability evaluation, based on our previous work on analyzing reliability of defect-tolerant architectures by exploiting various other models of computation.","","0-7803-8536","10.1109/NANO.2004.1392439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392439","","Quantum computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Entropy;Redundancy;Distributed computing;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic devices;Semiconductor device noise;Semiconductor device manufacture","fault tolerant computing;redundancy;probability;nanoelectronics;circuit simulation;circuit reliability;entropy;quantum gates;encoding","quantum computation model;reliability evaluation;defect tolerant nanoarchitectures;polynomial succinctness;multiple computation;reversible transformations;unitary transformations;circuit computation encoding;unitary evolution operations;entropy;multiple output reading;input probability distributions;entangled output","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information is represented by quantum bits (qubits) that correspond to microscopic states such as photon polarization. Up to 2n n-bit words can be stored simultaneously in n qubits, implying a type of massive parallelism. Powerful forms of quantum interaction such as interference and entanglement exist which have no counterparts in classical computer science. Some important and hitherto intractable problems such as prime factorization of large numbers can be solved efficiently using quantum methods. In practice, however, quantum computing devices and circuits are extremely difficult to design and build, since they are nanoscale in size and operate at very low energy levels. Consequently, they have many more failure modes than classical (non-quantum) circuits. For example, quantum signal states are inherently unstable and tend to decay rapidly due to interaction with the environment (decoherence). Quantum gate operations are defined by continuous parameters that allow small errors to arise and propagate to other gates. Furthermore, state measurement is probabilistic and the measurement process itself affects the state being measured. This talk will review the history and development of quantum circuits, with emphasis on their failure modes and testing requirements. It will be seen that quantum circuits are highly testable for classical faults. However, they are also subject to various complex, nonclassical failure modes, which are still not well understood. Some methods for error correction and recovery that have been developed specifically for quantum circuits will also be reviewed.","1081-7735;2377-5386","0-7695-2481","10.1109/ATS.2005.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575395","","Circuit testing;Circuit faults;Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Physics computing;Information processing;Microscopy;Polarization;Parallel processing;Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the last decade a new way to compute has been defined which, unlike conventional methods, is based on quantum mechanics rather than classical physics. This fundamental change in paradigm can, in principle, solve some important and hitherto intractable problems such as prime factorization of large numbers. This tutorial presentation reviews the basics of quantum computation and the design of circuits to implement quantum algorithms. The starting point is the notion of a quantum bit or qubit. Because of the superposition property of quantum states, n qubits can store 2/sup n/ numbers simultaneously, implying a type of massive parallelism. Furthermore, quantum states allow powerful forms of interaction such as entanglement that have no classical counterparts. Qubits are fragile, however, and are altered by measurement; hence quantum circuits must follow very different rules from classical ones. The differences between quantum and classical logic circuits is discussed and illustrated. Finally, the physical implementation of quantum devices is considered, along with the prospects for practical quantum computers.","","1-58113-688","10.1145/775832.776056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219146","","Tutorial;Quantum computing;Physics computing;Computer architecture;Quantum mechanics;Algorithm design and analysis;Parallel processing;Quantum entanglement;Logic circuits","quantum gates;reviews;quantum computing;quantum interference devices;circuit theory","quantum circuit;quantum mechanics;prime factorization;quantum computation;circuit design;quantum algorithm;quantum bit;qubit;superposition property;quantum state;massive parallelism;quantum entanglement;logic circuit;quantum device;quantum computer","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the design of the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this formulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is optimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement (EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the states can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal. Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal prior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets that are defined over a group of unitary matrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider compound GU state sets which are generated by a group of unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating vectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.807291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176618","","Quantum mechanics;Information theory;Sufficient conditions;Time measurement;Polynomials;Information processing;Information retrieval;Collaborative work;Subcontracting;Instruments","quantum communication;programming;optimisation;probability;matrix algebra;set theory","semidefinite programming;optimal unambiguous discrimination;linearly independent pure quantum states;sufficient conditions;quantum information theory;necessary conditions;optimal quantum measurement;global optimum;optimal quantum states;equal-probability measurement;equal prior probabilities;geometrically uniform state sets;unitary matrices;multiple generating vectors;weighted norm constraint","","67","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For each of these two learning models we establish a polynomial relationship between the number of quantum versus classical queries required for learning. Our results provide an interesting contrast to known results which show that testing black-box functions for various properties can require exponentially more classical queries than quantum queries. We also show that under a widely held computational hardness assumption there is a class of Boolean functions which is polynomial-time learnable in the quantum version but not the classical version of each learning model; thus while quantum and classical learning are equally powerful from an information theory perspective, they are different when viewed from a computational complexity perspective.","","0-7695-1053","10.1109/CCC.2001.933881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=933881","","Quantum computing;Boolean functions;Polynomials;Quantum mechanics;Testing;Information theory;Computational complexity;Probability distribution","learning (artificial intelligence);computational complexity;Boolean functions;quantum computing","quantum black-box query complexity;computational hardness assumption;Boolean functions;learning from membership queries;Probably Approximately Correct learning;learning from random examples;polynomial-time learnable;computational complexity;quantum computing","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantum mechanics allows a number of communications protocols that would not be possible classically, including provably-secure messages (quantum cryptography), increased channel capacity, and the ability to transmit an unknown quantum state (quantum teleportation). Practical systems for quantum cryptography have now been demonstrated by a number of groups. I will begin by reviewing the most commonly-used methods for quantum cryptography, including the advantages and disadvantages of each in practical applications. The maximum range of current quantum cryptography systems is limited by the fact that optical amplifiers would destroy the quantum coherence of single photons and cannot be used in these kinds of systems. One potential solution to this problem is the transmission of single photons in free space, which would allow a global system for quantum cryptography based on a network of satellites and ground stations. Free-space quantum cryptography systems of that kind have now been demonstrated over relatively short distances. The range of quantum cryptography systems in optical fibers can also be extended using quantum repeaters that make use of entanglement swapping, entanglement purification, and quantum teleportation. These same techniques could also be used to implement a ""quantum Internet"" for the transmission of qubits from one quantum computer to another. The practical challenges that will have to be met in order to implement quantum repeaters and quantum teleportation over large distances will be discussed.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.962022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962022","","Cryptography;Quantum mechanics;Teleportation;Quantum entanglement;Quantum computing;Repeaters;Cryptographic protocols;Channel capacity;Stimulated emission;Semiconductor optical amplifiers","quantum cryptography;quantum optics;optical communication;optical repeaters;optical fibre communication;channel capacity;telecommunication security;protocols","quantum mechanics;communications protocols;provably-secure messages;channel capacity;unknown quantum state;quantum teleportation;quantum cryptography;optical amplifiers;quantum coherence;single photons;free space communications;free-space quantum cryptography systems;optical fibers;quantum optical repeaters","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The shape of the memory is the vector of sizes of these qudits, which may differ. We determine when N copies of a quantum memory /spl Ascr/ embed in N(1+/spl ogr/(1)) copies of another quantum memory /spl Bscr/. This relationship captures the notion that/spl Bscr/ is as at least as useful as /spl Ascr/ for all purposes in the bulk limit. We show that the embeddings exist if and only if for all p/spl ges/1, the p-norm of the shape of /spl Ascr/ does not exceed the p-norm of the shape of /spl Bscr/. The log of the p-norm of the shape of /spl Ascr/ can be interpreted as the maximum of S(/spl rho/)+H(/spl rho/)/p (quantum entropy plus discounted classical entropy) taken over all mixed states /spl rho/ on /spl Ascr/. We also establish a noiseless coding theorem that justifies these entropies. The noiseless coding theorem and the bulk embedding theorem together say that either /spl Ascr/ blindly bulk-encodes into /spl Bscr/ with perfect fidelity, or A admits a state that does not visibly bulk-encode into/spl Bscr/with high fidelity. In conclusion, the utility of a hybrid quantum memory is determined by its simultaneous capacity for classical and quantum entropy, which is not a finite list of numbers, but rather a convex region in the classical-quantum entropy plane.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.811917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201069","","Entropy;Algebra;Shape;Matrices;Quantum mechanics;Noise shaping;Codes;Information theory;Quantum computing;Computational modeling","entropy;encoding;digital storage;optical storage","hybrid quantum memory capacity;stable quantum memory unit;classical digit;quantum digit;memory shape;vector size;quantum entropy;discounted classical entropy;noiseless coding theorem;bulk embedding theorem;convex region","","19","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although no physical realization of a quantum computer is available, a number of software systems simulating a quantum computation process exist. In light of the rapidly increasing power of desktop computers and their ability to carry out these simulations, it is worthwhile to investigate possible advantages as well as realizations of quantum algorithms in signal processing applications.

Eng., Notre Dame Univ., IN, USA","2004 Abstracts 10th International Workshop on Computational Electronics","","2004","","","120","121","Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a new computation paradigm which encodes bit information by charge configurations. No current flows through the cells; only Coulomb interaction contributes to the computation. Power dissipation has become an important issue in nanotechnology because of the high densities in nano-devices. The chip will melt unless the device dissipates only a small amount of energy to the environment. Landauer (Landauer and Keyes, 1970) has proposed an adiabatic switching method, which has been applied widely in clocked QCA cells (Timler and Lent, 2003). Gradual clocking insures the cells always in the instantaneous ground state, which can provide arbitrarily low power dissipation if the switching process is slow enough. Nondissipative computation can be achieved by keeping a copy to the bits that are going to be erased (Timler and Lent, 2003). Bennett pointed out that any computation could be rendered into reversible format by accumulating a history of all information that would normally thrown away, then disposing this history by the reverse of the process that created it (Bennett, 2000). In this paper, we employ the Bennett clocking design in QCA circuits, which clocks the circuit forward through the cell array and then retreats the clock in a backward sequence. In conventional CMOS considerable overhead in circuit complexity is required to achieve Bennett clocking. In QCA by contrast, no additional circuit complexity is required - only a different clock signal. We show by direct calculation of the equations of motion for a QCA system that energy dissipation less than k/sub B/Tlog(2) is possible for logically irreversible systems using the Bennett clocking approach.","","0-7803-8649","10.1109/IWCE.2004.1407356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407356","","Cellular automata;Logic circuits","quantum gates;quantum dots;cellular automata;logic circuits;electronic engineering computing;circuit complexity","Landauer clocking;quantum-dot cellular automata;Bennett clocking design;QCA circuits;cell array;circuit complexity;clock signal;energy dissipation;logically irreversible systems","","3","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These new technologies rely for security on the quantum ""uncertainty principle"" and on the long distance transmission of ""quantum entanglement"". A new type of tele-communications device called the ""quantum repeater"" can allow the faithful transmission of quantum information over worldwide distances, in spite of the inevitably severe losses while propagating along optical fibers. In a quantum repeater, information is stored in the quantum state of a semiconductor electron spin, while complementary entangled information is transmitted as a photon down the optical fiber. This long-range entanglement permits the execution of the teleportation algorithm, which accurately transmits a quantum state over long distances. The basis for an opto-electronic quantum repeater is an entanglement preserving InP photodetector with special selection rules, in which polarization information from a photon is transferred to spin polarization information of a photo-electron, and vice versa. Nevertheless, the algorithm requires that the photo-electron be transferred to a group IV semiconductor for long time storage since there is rapid loss of quantum information in III-V semiconductors. This paper reviews the experimental status of semiconductor quantum repeaters, including the spin resonance transistor logic gates, and the experimental detection of single photons in a manner that preserves their spin information.","","0-7803-7704","10.1109/ICIPRM.2003.1205380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1205380","","Quantum entanglement;Repeaters;Data security;Optical fibers;Optical fiber polarization;Cryptography;Information security;Uncertainty;Optical fiber losses;Propagation losses","quantum entanglement;spin polarised transport;optoelectronic devices;optical fibre communication;optical repeaters;photodetectors;indium compounds;III-V semiconductors;quantum gates","opto-electronic quantum telecommunications;spins in semiconductors;quantum information transmission;long distances;data security;quantum cryptography;quantum uncertainty principle;quantum entanglement;quantum repeater;teleportation algorithm;optical fiber;InP photodetector;selection rules;polarization information;spin polarization;group IV semiconductor;long time storage;semiconductor quantum repeaters;spin resonance transistor logic gates;single photons detection;InP","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The preparation of the quantum state of physical systems and its diagnostics by quantum-state reconstruction has been a subject of large progress in recent years. Various experiments have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of reconstructing the quantum state of optical fields, molecular vibrations, trapped ions, and matter waves. The impressive success in laser cooling of neutral atoms opens new possibilities for preparing quantum states of ensembles of atoms in optical lattices and also quantum computing. In this context, the diagnostics of the quantum state, would provide a very useful tool for studying the accuracy of prepared quantum states or exploring decoherence mechanisms. However, to our knowledge, a reconstruction method for optical lattices that accounts for typical features of optical lattice potentials such as anharmonicity and band structure, is not yet available. We propose such a method, that we think is relatively simple to implement, since only phase shifts of the lattice laser beams and measurements of the band populations in the lattice potential are needed.

Control and observation of these dynamics presents a challenging new direction in cavity QED from both the technological and theoretical point of view. Wiseman has considered quantum limited feedback on a continuously monitored system to reduce the noise in the evolution of the system below the shot noise level.

The role of the solid-state environment in the decoherence of electron spins is discussed. In particular, the limiting effect of the spin-orbit interaction on spin relaxation of conduction electrons is carefully examined in the light of recent theoretical and experimental progress. Most of the proposed spintronic devices involve spin-polarized transport across interfaces in various hybrid structures. The specific example discussed here, of a magnetic semiconductor/superconductor interface, displays many intricacies which a complex spin-dependent interface introduces in the spin-polarized transport. It is proposed that pairs of entangled electrons in a superconductor (Cooper pairs) can be transferred to a nonsuperconducting region, and consequently separated for a transport study of the spin entanglement.

Unlike logic computing, vision computing problems are error-tolerant, but are hard to solve on existing computing platforms. The cost of failure of not finding the optimal solution is not high; even solutions that are close to optimal can suffice. The problem of perceptual grouping concerns with selecting, based on Gestaltic perceptual cues, salient subsets of low-level features, such as straight line boundary segments, that are most likely to belong to objects in the scene. We formulate a method to map this problem, which can be cast in terms of energy minimization, onto an arrangement of QCA cells. The QCA cells correspond to the straight lines, and the kink energies between them model the Gestaltic cue affinities. The magnitude of the polarizations of the QCA cells denote the saliency of the corresponding image features. We use classical multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to synthesize the QCA cell layout. We demonstrate the ability of this arrangement to compute salient groups in real images by simulating the QCA layout using iterative, self consistent analysis, based on the Hartree-Fock approximation.","1944-9399","0-7803-9199","10.1109/NANO.2005.1500821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1500821","","Circuit synthesis;Quantum dots;Quantum cellular automata;Computer vision;Quantum computing;Logic;Cost function;Layout;Minimization methods;Polarization","cellular automata;quantum computing;computer vision;quantum dots;circuit CAD","vision computing;quantum-dot cellular automata circuits;Gestaltic perceptual cues;multi-dimensional scaling;consistent analysis;Hartree-Fock approximation;iterative analysis","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lett., vol.85, p.441, 2000) have provided a simple proof of security of the standard quantum key distribution scheme by Bennett and Brassard (1984) by demonstrating a connection between key distribution and entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) with one-way communications. Here, we provide proofs of security of standard quantum key distribution schemes, Bennett and Brassard and the six-state scheme, against the most general attack, by using the techniques of two-way entanglement purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only one-way classical communications in quantum key distribution (QKD). This is done by the explicit construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy amplification of) Bennett and Brassard that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which is higher than what any Bennett and Brassard scheme with only one-way classical communications can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state scheme over Bennett and Brassard by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a higher bit error rate than Bennett and Brassard. In particular, our six-state protocol can tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25% bit error rate for any secure Bennett and Brassard protocol. Consequently, our protocols may allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error correction, and privacy amplification protocols.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.807289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176619","","Quantum computing;Cryptographic protocols;Bit error rate;Cryptography;Purification;Privacy;Distributed computing;Security;Quantum entanglement;Error correction","quantum cryptography;protocols;error statistics;error correction;error detection","quantum key distribution security;two-way classical communications;entanglement purification protocols;distribution protocols;classical post-processing;error correction/detection;bit error rate;upper bound;secure protocol;distillation;error correction;privacy amplification protocols;BER","","144","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considerable progress has been made to dynamic pathway modelling as well as the related parameter estimation. However, few of them gives consideration for the issue of optimal sampling time selection for parameter estimation. Time course experiments in molecular biology rarely produce large and accurate data sets and the experiments involved are usually time consuming and expensive. Therefore, to approximate parameters for models with only few available sampling data is of significant practical value. For signal transduction, the sampling intervals are usually not evenly distributed and are based on heuristics. In the paper, we investigate an approach to guide the process of selecting time points in an optimal way to minimize the variance of parameter estimates. In the method, we first formulate the problem to a nonlinear constrained optimization problem by maximum likelihood estimation. We then modify and apply a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, which combines the advantages of both quantum computing and evolutionary computing, to solve the optimization problem. The new algorithm does not suffer from the morass of selecting good initial values and being stuck into local optimum as usually accompanied with the conventional numerical optimization techniques. The simulation results indicate the soundness of the new method.","","0-7803-8439","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1403247","Computational system biology;Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm;Dynamic pathway modelling;Signal transduction;Parameter estimation","Sampling methods;Biological system modeling;Quantum computing;Parameter estimation;Signal sampling;Heart;Systems biology;Constraint optimization;Maximum likelihood estimation;Evolutionary computation","cellular transport;physiological models;biology computing;maximum likelihood estimation;optimisation;evolutionary computation;quantum computing","optimal time points sampling;pathway modelling;cellular dynamics;system biology;dynamic pathway modelling;parameter estimation;time course experiments;molecular biology;signal transduction;nonlinear constrained optimization problem;maximum likelihood estimation;quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm;quantum computing;evolutionary computing","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although real-time feedback of measured signals is an essential component of sensing and control in classical settings, models for quantum feedback that are rigorous yet useful have only become possible since the advent of measurement-based quantum trajectory theory. The quantum feedback scenario introduces new concerns of coherence and measurement backaction, but recent work has shown that these can be treated properly in a formal integration of quantum trajectory theory with standard state-space formulations of filtering and control theory. Pioneering studies by H. M. Wiseman have shown that such models can be used to design and to analyze realistic schemes for adaptive homodyne measurement and for feedback control of atomic motion. Much of the ongoing research in our group focuses on the experimental implementation of such schemes. For a broad range of quantum feedback scenarios, certain recurring technical issues arise out of the need to perform complex, high-bandwidth processing of measured signals. We are developing a ""rapid-prototyping"" approach to refining signal processing and feedback algorithms via quantum trajectory simulation on a PC, followed by translation of the algorithms into hardware Description language (HDL).","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.962176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962176","","Quantum mechanics;Signal processing algorithms;Atomic measurements;Hardware design languages;State feedback;Coherence;Measurement standards;Filtering theory;Control theory;Programmable control","optical feedback;quantum optics;measurement theory;optical information processing","quantum feedback;adaptive measurements;real-time feedback;measured signals;sensing;measurement-based quantum trajectory theory;quantum feedback scenario;measurement backaction;quantum trajectory;state-space formulations;adaptive homodyne measurement;feedback control;atomic motion;quantum feedback scenarios;high-bandwidth processing;rapid-prototyping","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, for pure-state GU ensembles, the LSM is shown to be optimal. For arbitrary GU state sets we show that the optimal measurement operators are GU with generator that can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time, within any desired accuracy. We then consider compound GU (CGU) state sets which consist of subsets that are GU. When the generators satisfy a certain constraint, the LSM is again optimal.

The infrastructure we created comprises a complete compilation and simulation system for computers containing thousands of quantum bits. We begin by compiling complete algorithms into a quantum instruction set. This ISA enables the simple manipulation of quantum state. Another tool we developed automatically transforms quantum software into an equivalent, fault-tolerant version required to operate on real quantum devices. Next, our infrastructure transforms the ISA into a set of low-level micro architecture specific control operations. In the future, these operations can be used to directly control a quantum computer. For now, our simulation framework quickly uses them to determine the reliability of the application for the target micro architecture.

Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide excellent ground to explore many fundamental physical phenomena. One of such phenomena is quantum coherence/decoherence of confined carriers which is critical for quantum information processing and other applications. Recently, such phenomena have been studied experimentally as well as theoretically in naturally formed quantum dot systems. On the other hand, for technologically more important self assembled quantum dots (SAQDs), various experimental and theoretical investigations indicate a much richer electronic structure and more complex inter-level energy relaxation mechanisms.

Most QC simulators model ideal operations, and thus cannot predict the actual time required to execute an algorithm or quantify the effects of errors in the calculation.

This paper investigates the behaviors of some proposed QCA primitives: wires, crossings, corners, and logic gates, under two charge neutralization schemes. While these primitives work well under the originally proposed charge neutralization scheme, it is shown that with a more realistic scheme, most of the primitives can fail outright, show a preference for a undesirable logical state, or show a decrease in the energy gap between the ground state and other excited states.

The resulting curve is intimately related to the quantum compression with classical side information tradeoff curve Q/sup */(R) of Hayden, Jozsa, and Winter. For a general initial state, we obtain a similar result, with a single-letter formula, when we impose a tensor product restriction on the measurements performed by the sender; without this restriction, the tradeoff is given by the regularization of this function. Of particular interest is a quantity we call ""distillable common randomness"" of a state: the maximum overhead of the common randomness over the one-way classical communication if the latter is unbounded. It is an operational measure of (total) correlation in a quantum state. For classical-quantum correlations it is given by the Holevo mutual information of its associated ensemble; for pure states it is the entropy of entanglement.

We focus on the system-level issues of how quantum devices can be brought together to form a scalable architecture. In particular, we examine promising silicon-based proposals. We discover that communication of quantum data is a critical resource in such proposals. We find that traditional techniques using quantum SWAP gates are exponentially expensive as distances increase and propose quantum teleportation as a means to communicate data over longer distances on a chip.

By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time within any desired accuracy. Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of each optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the corresponding density operator.

One question concerning active media for semiconductor edge-emitting lasers is the behavior of the intracavity laser field (i.e., the beam quality) above threshold. Especially important are self-focusing effects which narrow the laser beam and eventually lead to beam break-up or filamentation. This paper presents theoretical and experimental results on the beam quality of edge-emitting lasers with InGaAs quantum dot active media. We use a screened Hartree-Fock theory to compute the complex susceptibility for a shallow quantum dot for different excitations. The inclusion of Coulomb effects not only influences the gain (imaginary part of the susceptibility), but also changes the dispersive behavior, i.e., the carrier induced refractive index (real part of the susceptibility) of a quantum dot active medium. Our theoretical results show that the filamentation tendency in quantum-dot lasers can be substantially weakened for sufficiently small inhomogeneous broadening, contrary to what is observed in quantum-well lasers. An indication of this is observed in our experimental results which show indeed a weaker filamentation tendency than quantum-well lasers. However, the calculations predict a still better beam quality for lasers fabricated from dot material with reduced inhomogeneous broadening.","","1-55752-706","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1034319","","Indium gallium arsenide;Quantum dot lasers;Laser beams;Laser theory;Semiconductor lasers;Quantum mechanics;Quantum computing;Quantum well lasers;Laser excitation;Dispersion","indium compounds;gallium arsenide;III-V semiconductors;quantum dot lasers;optical self-focusing;HF calculations;nonlinear optical susceptibility;spectral line broadening","InGaAs quantum-dot lasers;filamentation tendency;active media;semiconductor edge-emitting lasers;intracavity laser field;beam quality;threshold;self-focusing effects;laser beam;beam break-up;screened Hartree-Fock theory;complex susceptibility;shallow quantum dot;Coulomb effects;gain;dispersive behavior;carrier induced refractive index;inhomogeneous broadening;InGaAs","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous work has shown that the exchange energies for electrons confined by P donors in bulk Si display a fast oscillatory behavior with respect to the inter-donor distance (Koiller et al., 2002). This result implies that P donors need to be positioned with atomic-scale precision in order to implement a Si:P based quantum computer architecture. In contrast to the Si:P architecture, electronically confined Si quantum dots show a simple exponential decay of the exchange energies with the increase of the inter-dot distance. The exponential behavior is attributed to tensile biaxial strain in the Si quantum well, which is epitaxially grown on top of a relaxed Si/sub x/Ge/sub 1-x/ layer. The tensile biaxial strain lifts the degeneracy of six valleys in the Si band structure, with the Z valley at lower than the X and Y valleys. The lowest electron wave function originates from the Z valley, and hence Bloch oscillations are present in the z direction only. As a result, when the inter-dot distance changes along the x and y directions, the exchange energy, which is determined by the overlap between the two electron wave functions, does not oscillate.","","0-7803-8649","10.1109/IWCE.2004.1407352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407352","","Quantum dots","semiconductor quantum dots;exchange interactions (electron);tight-binding calculations;quantum well devices;quantum computing;elemental semiconductors;silicon","electron exchange interaction;electronically confined Si quantum dots;sp/sup 3/d/sup 5/s* empirical tight-binding model;exchange energy;P donors;fast oscillatory behavior;inter-donor distance;Si:P based quantum computer architecture;exponential decay;inter-dot distance;tensile biaxial strain;Si quantum well;Si band structure;electron wave function;Bloch oscillations;Si","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the feasibility of using single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to implement the clocking fields, effectively removing the clocking wire barrier to greater circuit densities.","","0-7803-8536","10.1109/NANO.2004.1392286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392286","","Carbon nanotubes;Quantum dots;Quantum cellular automata;Clocks;Circuits;Wire;Quantum computing;Computer architecture;Electrons;Polarization","carbon nanotubes;cellular automata;molecular electronics;nanoelectronics;quantum computing","single walled carbon nanotubes;quantum-dot cellular automata clocking;molecular computing;clock signal;electric field;clocking wire barrier;quantum-dot cellular automata circuit;C","","9","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics and was a source of many debates among the early founders of this theory. More recently, entanglement was considered as one of the key points in the field of quantum information processing. Those potential applications require however the deterministic production of entanglement implying a large number of subsystems. Spontaneous phenomena, generally used to entangle 2 systems, are therefore not easily extendable towards those requirements. Recent works have succeeded in producing entangled state of three or more particles by using spontaneous parametric down-conversion or a unitary operation on a ensemble of trapped ions. We have created an entangled state between two atoms and a mode of the electromagnetic field stored in a cavity. The particles are separated by centimetric distances, which allows for individual addressing. The entangled state is prepared by unitary reversible operations acting on one or two of the particles at the same time. The analysis of the state is performed by detecting correlations between individual observables.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961842","","Quantum entanglement;Electrodynamics;Resonance;Fluctuations;Photoconductivity;Quantum mechanics;Signal detection;Avalanche photodiodes;Oscilloscopes;Local oscillators","quantum electrodynamics;quantum optics;Rydberg states;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","engineered entanglement;cavity quantum electrodynamics;quantum mechanics;quantum information processing;spontaneous parametric down-conversion;unitary operation;trapped ion ensemble;unitary reversible operations;circular Rydberg levels","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design and excitation of novel quantum states and the measurement of those states is driven by both fundamental and technological goals. For example, the study of Schrodinger cat states touches upon the basic measurement hypotheses of quantum mechanics while the establishment of particular coherent superposition states is the starting point for the process of coherent control or for quantum information applications. The goals of the design research range from the manipulation of reaction pathways to the creation of novel states for the exploration of aspects of measurement theory. In addition to its fundamental interest the accurate measurement of both amplitude and phase of a wave function plays a key roles in the area of coherent control. The seminal work by Risken and Vogel (1989) reopened the modern discussion of the reconstruction problem that was first broached by Pauli. Since their work, reconstruction techniques have been developed for a variety of systems including the optical field in atomic systems. The measurement scheme used in the paper employs a noninterferometric technique. The subject of the measurement is a designed Rydberg wave packet in an atomic system. However, the noninterferometric character of the technique suggests that this technique may have wide applicability.","1094-5695","1-55752-608","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901461","","Pulse measurements;Atomic measurements;Quantum mechanics;Atom optics;Mechanical variables measurement;Particle measurements;Process control;Area measurement;Phase measurement;Wave functions","quantum theory;quantum optics;Rydberg states;atom-photon collisions;photoexcitation;wave functions","Rydberg wave packet;noninterferometric quantum measurement;multiple pulse excitation;novel quantum states;fundamental goals;technological goals;Schrodinger cat states;quantum mechanics;coherent superposition states;coherent control;quantum information applications;design research;reaction pathways;novel states;measurement theory;wave function;reconstruction techniques;optical field;atomic systems;noninterferometric technique;atomic system","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Cirac-Zoller model of quantum computation assumes that ions are confined in a linear ion trap. However, no experimental test of quantum computation or even of Raman cooling has yet been performed in a linear trap; instead the NIST group has used a miniature Paul trap in which a slight asymmetry or ellipticity is introduced to define an axis of crystallization. In this paper the case of arbitrary ellipticity is considered and two results for the crystal size and micromotion amplitude are derived. The first relation is a linear crystal stability condition, which shows that the maximum number of ions which can be confined is uniquely related to the ellipticity by a 7/3 power law. The second result shows that the micromotion in elliptical traps is far smaller than one would expect naively, specifically that the micromotion amplitude depends approximately on the 1/5 power of the number of trapped ions.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807382","","Quantum computing;Teleportation;Optical receivers;Performance gain;Quantum entanglement;Optical noise;Nonlinear optics;Stimulated emission;Solids;Uncertainty","particle traps;radiation pressure;optical computing;quantum optics","elliptical ion traps;quantum computation;Cirac-Zoller model;linear ion trap;Raman cooling;NIST group;miniature Paul trap;slight asymmetry;ellipticity;crystallization axis;crystal size;micromotion amplitude;linear crystal stability condition;trapped ions","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A method is presented based on the theory of quantum damping, for deriving a self-consistent but approximate form of the quantum transport for photons interacting with a fully ionized electron plasma. Specifically, we propose in this paper a technique for approximately including the effects of background plasma on a photon distribution function by replacing the influence of the plasma degrees of freedom with quantum fluctuation and damping terms in the radiation transport equation. We consider the Markov limit where the electron relaxation time scale is short compared to the photon relaxation time scale. The result is a quantum Langevin equation for the photon number operator; the quantum radiative transfer equation. A dissipation term appears which is the imaginary part of the dielectric function for an electron gas undergoing electron scattering due to emission and absorption of photons. It depends only on the initial state of the plasma. A quantum noise operator also appears as a result of spontaneous emission of photons from the electron plasma. The thermal expectation value of this noise operator yields the emissivity which is exactly of the form of the Kirchoff-Planck relation. This non-zero thermal expectation value is a direct consequence of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The fluctuations of the quantum noise operator yield the deviations from the Kirchoff-Planck relation.

The nodes of the Bayesian Network (BN) are the random variables, representing individual cells, and the links between them capture the dependencies among them. The modeling exploits the spatially local nature of the dependencies and the induced causality from the wave propagation and clocking schemes to arrive at a minimal, factored, representation of the overall joint probability of the cell states in terms of local conditional probabilities. This BN model allows us (1) to estimate the most likely (or ground) state configuration and the next lowest-energy configuration that results in output errors and (2) to show how weak spots in clocked QCA circuit designs can be found using these BN models by comparing the (most likely) ground state configuration with the next most likely energy state configuration that results in output error.","1944-9399","0-7803-9199","10.1109/NANO.2005.1500753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1500753","","Stationary state;Quantum cellular automata;Clocks;Bayesian methods;Circuit synthesis;Quantum dots;Computer networks;Quantum computing;Random variables;State estimation","quantum dots;cellular automata;logic circuits;belief networks;quantum computing;ground states;probabilistic automata;wave propagation","graphical probabilistic inference;near-ground state computing;graphical probabilistic Bayesian network model;clocked quantum-dot cellar automata based circuit design;binary discrete states;wave propagation;clocking schemes;joint probability;cell states;lowest-energy configuration;weak spots;energy state configuration;nanocomputing","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information has always been valuable, never more so than in recent decades, and throughout history people have turned to cryptography in an attempt to keep important information secret. Coherent manipulation of quantum states promises to rearrange the lists of possible and impossible cryptographic tasks. The author gives an overview of the changes, including Shor's algorithm to break classical codes with a quantum computer and protocols for quantum key distribution using single photons to perform unbreakable encryption. One useful classical technique is the idea of a public key, which can be safely handed out even to an adversary. The author shows how to create quantum protocols with similar properties, and how they can be used to create unbreakable digital signatures.","","1-55752-708","10.1109/QELS.2002.1031293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031293","","Public key cryptography;Protocols;Data security","quantum cryptography;public key cryptography;quantum optics;protocols;message authentication","private key quantum cryptography;public key quantum cryptography;coherent quantum state manipulation;Shor algorithm;classical code breaking;quantum computer;protocols;quantum key distribution;single photons;unbreakable encryption;quantum protocols;unbreakable digital signatures","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For many applications making use of photon interference, such as entanglement swapping or teleportation, a short pulse pumped source of photon pairs is required to enable multi-photon pair generation. However, timing information inherent in pulses affects the interference, and spectrally dispersive component media properties poses further fundamental effects on the degree of interference. In particular dispersion cancellation effects expected for CW pumped cases do not apply in general to pulse pumped applications. Theoretical models to account for such effects in a Hong-Ou-Mandel Interferometer (HOMI) have recently been published [Perina, PRA, 58, 2359 (1999); Franson, PRA, 45, 3126 (1992)]; the results presented here, give to our knowledge the first experimental observation of dispersive reduction of quantum interference, as well as the full restoration expected, when very large dispersion is balanced along the paths of the two photons.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961854","","Optical fiber dispersion;Interference;Optical fiber polarization;Optical pumping;Ultrafast optics;Quantum mechanics;Delay;Glass;Optical interferometry;Optical pulses","light interferometers;optical dispersion;quantum optics;light interference;high-speed optical techniques;optical pumping","quantum dispersion cancellation;photon interference;ultrafast optical signal processing systems;entanglement swapping;teleportation;short pulse pumped source;photon pairs;multi-photon pair generation;timing information;spectrally dispersive component;light interference;dispersion cancellation;CW pumped cases;pulse pumped applications;Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer;dispersive reduction;quantum interference;very large dispersion","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, a new surprising effect occurs in the ionization of this system: at the dipole-allowed area resonances, the spectrum of ionized electrons sharply concentrates near the bottom of the continuum, while at the area resonances to the odd-number bound levels, the photoelectron spectra are maximally broad. Area resonances may be observable with available sub-cycle pulses (half-cycle pulses).

Underlying our complexity result is a general relation between deterministic and quantum one-way communication complexities, which applies to partial as well as total functions. Second, we construct an oracle relative to which NP /spl nsub/ BQP/qpoly. To do so, we use the polynomial method to give the first correct proof of a direct product theorem for quantum search. This theorem has many other applications; for example, it can be used to fix and even improve on a flawed result of Klauck about quantum time-space tradeoffs for sorting. Third, we introduce a trace distance method for proving lower bounds on quantum one-way communication complexity. Using this method, we obtain optimal quantum lower bounds for two problems of Ambainis, for which no nontrivial lower bounds were previously known even for classical randomized protocols.","1093-0159","0-7695-2120","10.1109/CCC.2004.1313854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1313854","","Quantum mechanics;Complexity theory;Quantum computing;Polynomials;Boolean functions;Physics computing;Sorting;Protocols;Teleportation;Fingerprint recognition","communication complexity;quantum communication;protocols;search problems;quantum computing","quantum mechanics;quantum messages;BQP/qpoly;PP/poly;quantum polynomial time;quantum advice state;communication complexity;quantum one-way communication;direct product theorem;quantum search;sorting","","6","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We say that the quantum observables ""position"" and ""momentum"" are ""complementary"" because the precise knowledge of the position (momentum) implies that all possible outcomes of measuring the momentum (position) are equally probable. In two-slit experiments, the common understanding is that the position-momentum uncertainty relation makes it impossible to determine which slit the photon (or electron) passes through without at the same time disturbing the object enough to destroy the interference pattern. In 1982, Scully et al. suggested a way around this position-momentum uncertainty obstacle and proposed a quantum eraser to obtain which-path or particle-like information without scattering or otherwise introducing large uncontrolled phase factors to disturb the interference. Since 1982, quantum has been claimed in several experiments; however, the original proposed ideas have not been fully demonstrated. We demonstrate them here.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807445","","Interference;Atomic beams;Atom optics;Physics;Quantum cascade lasers;Quantum mechanics;Optical interferometry;Optical solitons;Event detection;Photonic crystals","quantum optics;light interference;light scattering;complementarity;indeterminancy","quantum eraser experiment;quantum observables;two-slit experiments;position-momentum uncertainty relation;interference pattern;position-momentum uncertainty obstacle;particle-like information;large uncontrolled phase factors","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The excitonic optical response of single quantum dots (QD) has recently been isolated by using high spatial resolution techniques.

Coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy provides a powerful additional tool for the study of the interaction between magnetic substrates, as has been demonstrated for a single quantum dot. By directly probing the quantum dot resonances under the effect of a magnetic field we can obtain information about spin relaxation times and the presence of dark states.

Entanglement has proven to be an important resource in generating completely new optical states that can be used in quantum information processing, secure communication, and precise optical measurement. The transition from this theoretical notion to experimental reality is often a challenging step, however. One of the most accessible sources of entangled-photon states is a nonlinear optical process called spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), in which an-optical crystal illuminated by a laser beam spontaneously generates pairs of photons. We present a formalism that incorporates the hyper-entangled nature of the quantum state generated via SPDC. The key to providing an adequate physical description of ultrafast parametric down conversion is to consider the initial entangled state in its entirety including the interplay among the different quantum variables.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961852","","Ultrafast optics;Optimized production technology;Quantum entanglement;Nonlinear optics;Teleportation;Information processing;Photonic crystals;Laser theory;Frequency;Quantum mechanics","high-speed optical techniques;optical parametric devices;optical frequency conversion;quantum optics","hyperentanglement;femtosecond parametric down-conversion;spontaneous parametric down-conversion;hyper-entangled nature;quantum state;physical description;ultrafast parametric down conversion;quantum variables;ultrafast experiments","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, on the other hand, provide a powerful mathematical tool in modeling ""semantics."" The organization and the manipulation of information, knowledge base construction and discovery,. information retrieval and logical inferencing all deal with semantics in a fundamental way. Unless we experience a breakthrough in understanding semantics, especially related to machine automation, it will be difficult to make a quantum jump in accessing, creating, and modifying information. This paper intends to bring to center stage the complex problems of semantics confronted while dealing with natural language.

Recently, many quantum authentication protocols sharing quantum entangled particles between communicators have been proposed, providing unconditional security. An issue caused by sharing quantum entangled particles is that it may not be simple to apply these protocols to authenticate a specific user in a group of many users.

The devices were fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in a Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb trilayer process.

This magnetic noise plays a fundamental role in the design of spintronic devices: namely, it sets the time scale during which electron spins retain their coherence. This paper presents a rigorous classical and quantum analysis of thermal magnetic noise, together with practical engineering examples. Starting with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Maxwell's equations, a closed-form expression for the spectral density of thermal magnetic noise is derived. Quantum decoherence, as induced by thermal magnetic noise, is analyzed via the independent oscillator heat bath model of Ford et al. The resulting quantum Langevin equations yield closed-form expressions for the spin relaxation times. For realistic experiments in spintronics, magnetic resonance force microscopy, Bose-Einstein condensates, atomic physics, and solid-state quantum computing, the predicted relaxation rates are rapid enough that substantial experimental care must be taken to minimize them. At zero temperature, the quantum entanglement between a spin state and a thermal reservoir is computed. The same Hamiltonian matrix elements that govern fluctuation and dissipation are shown to also govern entanglement and renormalization, and a specific example of a fluctuation-dissipation-entanglement theorem is constructed. We postulate that this theorem is independent of the detailed structure of thermal reservoirs, and therefore expresses a general thermodynamic principle.","0018-9219;1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.811796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200131","","Quantum mechanics;Magnetic noise;Magnetoelectronics;Magnetic force microscopy;Quantum computing;Fluctuations;Magnetic analysis;Maxwell equations;Closed-form solution;Reservoirs","magnetic noise;quantum entanglement;Maxwell equations;thermal noise;fluctuations;spin Hamiltonians","magnetic resonance force microscopy;quantum computation;spintronics;thermal magnetic noise;quantum microscopy;thermal fluctuations;fluctuation-dissipation theorem;Maxwell's equations;closed-form expression;spectral density;quantum decoherence;independent oscillator heat bath model;quantum Langevin equations;spin relaxation times;relaxation rates;quantum entanglement;spin state;thermal reservoir;Hamiltonian matrix elements;renormalization","","3","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A sizeable variation in the QW carrier densities can be achieved as a function of well composition and placement due to the built-in electric field that forces carriers toward the p-side of the SCH and the different densities of states and carrier capture rates of the QW's. Transversely emitted spontaneous emission (SE) is measured through a windowed contact to determine the relative contribution from each QW to the total SE. Information from these measurements is incorporated into a detailed device model to determine the carrier density and evaluate the gain characteristics in a new way. Since the nonidentical wells emit different photon energies, it is shown for the first time that the carrier density can be determined at a specific location within the SCH of a semiconductor laser. By changing the placement of dissimilar QW's and the grading of the SCH, it is found that the gain spectrum can be substantially engineered.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.788426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=788426","","Spontaneous emission;Charge carrier density;Quantum well lasers;Density measurement;Gain measurement;Power engineering and energy;Gallium arsenide;Carrier confinement;Photonic band gap;Laser modes","spontaneous emission;carrier density;quantum well lasers;gallium arsenide;aluminium compounds;indium compounds;III-V semiconductors;gradient index optics;optical fabrication;laser beams;electronic density of states","carrier distribution;spontaneous emission;gain engineering;lasers;nonidentical quantum wells;quantum-well lasers;GaAs quantum-well;AlGaInAs quantum well;graded Al/sub x/Ga/sub 1-x/As separate confinement heterostructure;bandgap;carrier densities;well composition;well placement;built-in electric field;densities of states;carrier capture rates;transversely emitted spontaneous emission;windowed contact;relative contribution;carrier density;gain characteristics;nonidentical wells;photon energies;semiconductor laser;grading;gain spectrum;100 A;40 A;840 nm;810 nm;AlGaInAs;GaAs;AlGaAs;GaAs-AlGaInAs-AlGaAs","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The idea of quantum teleportation is to utilize the nonlocal correlations between an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair of particles to prepare a quantum system in some state, which is the exact replica of an arbitrary unknown state of a distant individual system. Three experiments in this direction were published recently. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum teleportation scheme which satisfies all four of the above conditions. The input state is an arbitrary polarization state and the BSM can distinguish all four orthogonal Bell states so that the state has a 100% certainty to be teleported in principle. This is because the BSM is based on nonlinear interactions which are necessary and non-trivial physical processes for correlating the input state and the entangled EPR pair.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.962120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962120","","Teleportation;Photonic crystals;Single photon emission computed tomography;Detectors;Polarization;Frequency;Particle measurements;Physics;Paramagnetic resonance;Phase detection","optical frequency conversion;quantum communication;optical communication;quantum optics;optical correlation;Bell theorem","quantum teleportation;complete Bell state measurement;Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair;quantum system;input state;arbitrary polarization state;orthogonal Bell states;nonlinear interactions;nontrivial physical processes;entangled EPR pair;optical sum frequency generation","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We report two two-slit experiments in which complementarity is enforced by availability of which-path information at the measurement stage of the quantum, which is different from the traditional understanding.

The simulated layer structure in the z direction is shown. In order to obtain the electron density inside the LCQD, we solve self-consistently 3D Poisson and Kohn-Sham equations within the local spin density approximation (LSDA), while outside the LCQD, we use the Thomas-Fermi approximation to compute the charge densities. The above differential equations are discretized on a nonuniform 3D mesh using realistic doping profiles and boundary conditions (Matagne and Leburton, 2002). Electronic states and eigenenergy spectra reflecting the particular LCQD confinement are obtained as a function of the external gate biases. The conditions for charging the dots with successive electrons, as a function of the applied gate biases, are determined by the Slater's rule, by which we derive the stability diagram for the system in the few-electron regime (Zhang et al., 2004). We investigate the detector sensitivity of different QPC gate geometries to the first electron charging in the quantum dot. For this purpose, we obtain the variation of the potential energy saddle point in the constriction at the first electron charging as a function of different QPC gate biases. We then use the Buttiker formula (Buttiker, 1990) to compute the relative change of the conductance (/spl Delta/G/G) over the specified QPC gate bias range.

The two-dimensional map is initialized to random quantum states with its training data and the training process selects each winner using a decoherence operator that reduces the quantum states to classic non-probabilistic states. The QISOM is not used to cluster new data; it is used as a current state of the population that is updated in real time. The QISOM is useful when observations from a very large population are presented in small batches. The result is that the prevalence of very rare events may be more accurate than with traditional statistical sampling in batches. However, this is accomplished at the cost of the absolute prevalence accuracy of more common events, although rank ordering of prevalence is preserved. The assumption for employing a QISOM is that the primary concern is to capture the prevalence of very rare critical and costly events. The QISOM is demonstrated with data on selected health and social problems of children.

Along with the growing body of experimental work on semiconductor quantum dots, there have been efforts to characterize these interactions through approximation techniques. This paper presents a formulation of the Hartree-Fock approximation using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to simulate two particles in a quantum dot. The FDTD method is one of the most widely used methods in electromagnetic simulation and it has recently been applied to the simulation of the Schroedinger equation. The computational intensity of the Coulomb and exchange terms are partly circumvented by using signal-processing techniques and a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform. While the resulting simulation is computationally intense, it is well within the realm of state-of-the-art computing platforms. This technique allows for the simulation of two-electron wavepacket dynamics as well as the determination of energy eigenstates.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961887","","Time domain analysis;Nanostructures;Computational modeling;Quantum dot lasers;Finite difference methods;Quantum dots;Integral equations;Fourier transforms;Optical microscopy;Physics","semiconductor quantum dots;HF calculations;finite difference time-domain analysis;chemical potential;potential energy functions;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","quantum nanostructures;time-domain simulation;Hartree-Fock approximation;semiconductor quantum dots;FDTD method;exchange terms;Coulomb terms;two-dimensional fast Fourier transform;two-electron wavepacket dynamics;energy eigenstates;coupled equations;convolution;chemical potential;eigenenergies;eigenfunctions;arbitrary nanostructures;external electromagnetic pulses","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A second-order master equation for the evolution of the many-body reduced density matrix of the active region was being introduced. This contains full quantum-mechanical information about the processes in the current-limiting active region. The master equation is derived directly form the Liouville equation for the active region+contacts, by using the partial-trace-free approach, and it incorporates the memory terms that describe the information exchange between the contacts and the active region. In this way, the state of the contacts is accounted for, but does not explicitly enter the calculation, allowing us to compute the full many-body reduced density matrix for the active region. The model accounts for the presence of the bias by assuming a special form of the forcing term in the master equation. The numerical simulation shows that incorporation of the memory terms is crucial for description of charging/discharging in the well, and obtaining the proper transient behavior. Electron-electron interaction between the active region and the contacts, as well as phonon scattering (within the relaxation-time approximation), have been taken into account.","","0-7803-8649","10.1109/IWCE.2004.1407325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407325","","","resonant tunnelling;many-body problems;quasiparticles;mesoscopic systems","quantum many-body density matrix model;sub-femtosecond transport;mesoscopic structures;transient transport;resonant-tunneling diode;quantum-mechanical information;current-limiting active region;Liouville equation;partial trace free approach;electron-electron interaction;phonon scattering;relaxation time approximation","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adiabatic quantum computation is a novel paradigm for the design of quantum algorithms; it is truly quantum in the sense that it can be used to speed up searching by a quadratic factor over any classical algorithm. On the question of whether this new paradigm may be used to efficiently solve NP-complete problems on a quantum computer, we show that the usual query complexity arguments cannot be used to rule out a polynomial time solution. On the other hand, we argue that the adiabatic approach may be thought of as a kind of 'quantum local search'. We design a family of minimization problems that is hard for such local search heuristics, and establish an exponential lower bound for the adiabatic algorithm for these problems. This provides insights into the limitations of this approach. It remains an open question whether adiabatic quantum computation can establish an exponential speed-up over traditional computing or if there exists a classical algorithm that can simulate the quantum adiabatic process efficiently.","","0-7695-1116","10.1109/SFCS.2001.959902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959902","","Quantum computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Polynomials;Computational modeling;Computer science;Quantum mechanics;Simulated annealing;Computer simulation;Laboratories;Cryptography","quantum computing;search problems;computational complexity;minimisation","adiabatic quantum computation;computational power;quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm;quantum algorithms;quadratic factor;NP-complete problems;quantum computer;query complexity arguments;polynomial time solution;quantum local search;minimization problems;local search heuristics;exponential lower bound;exponential speed-up","","19","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A quantum convolutional code encoder can be implemented by using quantum linear feed-forward shift registers and quantum exclusive-OR (controlled-NOT: CNOT) gates. A quantum memory may be used as a quantum state delay element of a quantum register. It is also shown that different encoder architectures one needed for quantum nonsuperposition and superposition state inputs. For quantum superposition state input, additional Hadamard gates should be used in conjunction with a quantum convolutional code encoder for quantum nonsuperposition state input.","","0-7803-8622","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399317","","Convolutional codes;Flip-flops;Quantum computing;Computer architecture;USA Councils;Polynomials;Delay effects;Feedback circuits;Shift registers;Protection","convolutional codes;feedforward;quantum gates;shift registers;Hadamard codes;delays","quantum convolutional code design;encoder architecture;classical nonsystematic convolutional code;quantum linear feed-forward shift registers;quantum exclusive-OR gate;state delay element;quantum nonsuperposition;superposition state input;Hadamard gate","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such wire-crossing networks, also called crossbar networks, are an important part of modern programmable logic devices, such as programmable arrays of logic. The crossbar networks are made possible through the use of parallel-to-serial converters and special regions with latching signals that are selected to sample and hold a particular value of serial data at a selected time. The particular signal connections made within the crossbar network are determined solely by the timing of the special latching signals rather than through physical changes to the device, so the same physical structure can be dynamically reprogrammed to provide a variety of different interconnection functions at different times. This wire-crossing network does not suffer from the shortcomings of the previously demonstrated QCA wire-crossing method, which required the use of rotated cells located on an interstitial cell spacing grid.

Quantum wires, which transport quantum data, is a fundamental component in all anticipated silicon quantum architectures. We introduce a quantum wire architecture based upon quantum teleportation. We compare this teleportation channel with the traditional approach to transporting quantum data, which we refer to as the swapping channel. We characterize the latency and bandwidth of these two alternatives in a device-independent way and describe how the advanced architecture of the teleportation channel overcomes a basic limit to the maximum communication distance of the swapping channel. In addition, we discover a fundamental tension between the scale of quantum effects and the scale of the classical logic needed to control them. This ""pitch-matching"" problem imposes constraints on minimum wire lengths and wire intersections, which in turn imply a sparsely connected architecture of coarse-grained quantum computational elements. This is in direct contrast to the ""sea of gates "" architectures presently assumed by most quantum computing studies.","1063-6897","0-7695-1945","10.1109/ISCA.2003.1207015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207015","","Wires;Quantum computing;Computer architecture;Teleportation;Buildings;Pressing;Silicon;Delay;Bandwidth;Logic devices","quantum gates;quantum entanglement;teleportation;quantum wires;computer architecture;quantum communication;computation theory","silicon quantum wire architecture;quantum data transportation;quantum teleportation;swapping channel;quantum communication distance;classical logic scale;pitch-matching problem;coarse-grained quantum computational element;sea of gates architecture","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the ubiquity of power laws in natural and man-made systems, these include a new view of turbulence in highly sheared flows that results from design for drag minimization, the origin of macroscopic dissipation and thermodynamic irreversibility in microscopically reversible dynamics, the universality of quantum gates for quantum computing, decoherence minimization in quantum systems, and entanglement witnessing. The latter ones are problems at the heart of several important tasks such as quantum computing, teleportation and quantum key distribution. Much of the original motivation for a new science of complexity came from the hope that methods of theoretical physics could contribute to a theory of complex engineering and biological networks and systems. This collection of work shows that apparently exactly the opposite is true. The role that robust control methods play in this research will be the central theme of this paper, around which the other issues will be woven. The aim is not to provide a control-friendly rederivation of known results in physics, but rather to illustrate through representative examples, how exciting new results and important insight, as assessed by physicists themselves, can be obtained through the mathematics and methods that the control community has developed. Since this work is largely being published in the scientific literature, the controls community may be largely unaware of these developments.","0191-2216","0-7803-7516","10.1109/CDC.2002.1185093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185093","","Physics;Quantum computing;Quantum entanglement;Mathematics;Control theory;Power system interconnection;Thermodynamics;Microscopy;Heart;Biology computing","interconnected systems;robust control;shear turbulence;drag reduction;thermodynamic properties;teleportation;quantum theory;quantum entanglement","theoretical physics;mathematics;control theory;persistent mysteries;interconnected system;multiscale systems;power laws;man-made systems;sheared flows;turbulence;drag minimization;macroscopic dissipation;thermodynamic irreversibility;reversible dynamics;quantum gates;quantum computing;decoherence minimization;quantum systems;entanglement witnessing;teleportation;quantum key distribution;complex engineering;biological networks;robust control;scientific literature","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Steady progress has been made in implementing QCA; a small binary logic device has recently been manufactured and its logical switching behavior demonstrated. However, computation with hierarchical assemblies of primitive logic devices has not yet been demonstrated. Earlier work has shown that the four ground states of the originally proposed automata for implementing AND and OR are at slightly different energy levels. Because of this, certain combinations of these gates relax to ground states that encode an incorrect computation. A previously proposed construct, which essentially computes all four ground states simultaneously and thus evens out the disparities, works well under the idealized charge neutralization scheme originally proposed by the inventors of QCA. Unfortunately, under the more realistic image charge neutralization, the construction has only slightly better characteristics than the original gates and only then when the separation distance between the automaton and the metal layer generating the image charges is rather small. This paper investigates methods for evening out the disparate ground states in the presence of image charge neutralization. Previously, it was shown that the more symmetric the automaton, the better its computational behavior under image charge neutralization. It is shown that adding symmetry also reduces the disparity in ground states and a new construct for balancing QCA logic gates is presented.","","0-7803-7538","10.1109/NANO.2002.1032262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1032262","","Quantum cellular automata;Logic gates;Stationary state;Logic devices;Quantum computing;Quantum dots;Quantum mechanics;Manufacturing;Assembly;Energy states","cellular automata;quantum gates;ground states","QCA logic gate balancing;image charge neutralization;quantum-dot cellular automata;QCA;quantum computing;energy relaxation;quantum gates;disparate ground states","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of optical Raman interactions to excite spin coherences in solids has numerous potential applications, ranging from low-power nonlinear optics to high-temperature spectral hole burning memories to solid-state quantum computing. The interest in Raman excitation lies in the fact that the spin coherences can be efficiently excited and manipulated using optical laser fields yet are weakly coupled to the environment and hence have the long coherence lifetimes needed for optical memories and quantum computing. The interest in nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) color centers in diamond is its large optical oscillator strength. For memory, a large oscillator strength is important for high temperature operation. For quantum computing, the high optical transition rate enables the higher gate speed and the larger number of quantum logic operations that can be performed within the spin coherence lifetime.","","1-55752-662","10.1109/CLEO.2001.947938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=947938","","Quantum computing;Nonlinear optics;Optical computing;Laser excitation;Random access memory;Oscillators;Solid state circuits;Solid lasers;Optical coupling;Temperature","diamond;self-induced transparency;Raman spectra;oscillator strengths;vacancies (crystal);V-centres;optical hole burning;multiwave mixing;quantum gates;optical logic;quantum optics","diamond;nitrogen-vacancy color centers;Raman excited spin coherences;optical Raman interactions;spin coherences;solids;low-power nonlinear optics;high-temperature spectral hole burning memories;solid-state quantum computing;Raman excitation;optical laser fields;environment;coherence lifetimes;optical memories;quantum computing;N-vacancy color centers;N-V color centers;optical oscillator strength;memory;high temperature operation;optical transition rate;higher gate speed;quantum logic operations;spin coherence lifetime;C;C:N","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We extend their work by introducing another enumerator, based on the classical theory of shadow codes, that tightens their bounds significantly. In particular, nearly all of the codes known to be optimal among additive quantum codes (codes derived from orthogonal geometry) can be shown to be optimal among all quantum codes. We also use the shadow machinery to extend a bound on additive codes to general codes, obtaining as a consequence that any code of length, can correct at most [(n+1)/6] errors.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/18.796376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=796376","","Dual codes","quantum cryptography;dual codes;error correction codes;linear programming;transforms","quantum shadow enumerators;weight enumerators;quantum error-correcting codes;MacWilliams transform;linear-programming bound;quantum codes;shadow codes;additive quantum codes;optimal codes;orthogonal geometry;additive codes;general codes;code length;self dual codes;nonnegative enumerator;parity","","30","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Fundamental questions about the operational temperature and functional gain of devices built from molecular-scale QCA cells are addressed in this paper through a statistical-mechanical model based on electrostatic interactions. The model provides exact solutions for the thermodynamic constraints on operation of small arrays of cells (up to 15). An Ising approximation dramatically reduces the computational task and allows modeling of the thermodynamic behavior of semi-infinite QCA wires. The probability of getting the correct output from a QCA device for a given input depends on temperature, cell size, cell-cell distance, effective dielectric constant of the medium, and the number of cells in the array. Using parameters derived from molecular candidates for QCA cells, the statistical-mechanical model predicts that majority gates should give correct output at temperatures of up to 450 K, while wires of thousands to millions of QCA cells are predicted to operate as functional devices at room temperature.","1536-125X;1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2004.828576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331326","","Quantum cellular automata;Thermodynamics;Quantum dots;Wires;Logic devices;Temperature distribution;Electrostatics;Molecular electronics;Probability;Temperature dependence","logic arrays;cellular automata;molecular electronics;quantum dots;quantum wires;quantum gates;permittivity;Ising model;statistical mechanics;thermodynamic properties","molecular-scale quantum-dot cellular automata wires;thermodynamic properties;molecular electronics;information transmission;information processing;electrostatic interactions;cell arrays;operational temperature;functional gain;thermodynamic constraints;Ising approximation;computational task;probability;cell size;cell-cell distance;effective dielectric constant;dielectric medium;statistical-mechanical model;room temperature;quantum gates;293 to 298 K","","57","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In general, it has been assumed that the optical detection is carried out by p-i-n diodes, which count the photons present in the field. However, the theory of quantum detection indicates that other measurements might yield significantly smaller error probabilities. In this paper, we show by example that this can happen in the multiple-access case.

In this paper, we report experimental studies on dephasing in CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals using high resolution spectral hole burning. These studies not only allow us to determine the homogeneous linewidth, but also reveal directly discrete acoustic phonon sidebands. The extremely small homogeneous linewidth (32 /spl mu/eV) obtained at low temperature along with the nonlinear temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth indicates that the quantization of acoustic phonon modes leads to strong suppression of dephasing associated with electron-phonon interactions in nanocrystals.

Recently, an alternative copper-copper thermocompression wafer bonding technique was used to extend cw operation up to a temperature of 97 K.","","0-7803-8490","10.1109/ICIMW.2004.1421961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1421961","","Resonance;Waveguide lasers;Quantum cascade lasers;Temperature;Phonons;Gallium arsenide;Quantum computing;Laboratories;Wafer bonding;Frequency","quantum cascade lasers;population inversion;submillimetre wave lasers;optical waveguides;resonant tunnelling;wafer bonding;tape automated bonding;submillimetre wave generation","terahertz quantum cascade lasers;resonant-phonon depopulation scheme;population inversion;high modal confinement metal-metal waveguide;indium-gold reactive wafer bonding technique;pulsed mode;continuous wave mode;magnetic field;copper-copper thermocompression wafer bonding technique;137 K;93 K;2.1 THz;97 K;141 micron;Cu-Cu","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each single molecule acts as a QCA cell and binary information is encoded in the configuration of charge among redox-active molecular sites. Coulomb interaction between neighboring molecules provides information transport from one molecule to another, so the heat dissipation is low because no current through molecular circuits is needed. In this paper, we present a quantum-chemistry ab initio analysis of these two QCA candidates. For Trans-Ru(dppm)/sub 2/(C=CFc)(NCCH/sub 2/CH/sub 2/NH/sub 2/) dication, our calculation confirms a bistable charge configuration in which the binary information can be encoded. The ferrocence and Ru(dppm)/sub 2/ groups are two natural quantum dots in the molecule. The carbon-carbon triple bond connecting these two dots provides the tunneling junction for a mobile electron. Driven by an external electric field, the mobile electron can move from one dot to the other, resulting in an abrupt change of dipole moment. The critical driven field is determined by the energy difference of the bistable states and the effect of counterions as well. Our calculations qualitatively explain the experimental observations.","","0-7803-8649","10.1109/IWCE.2004.1407355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407355","","Cellular automata;Molecular electronics;Charge carrier mobility","cellular automata;quantum dots;molecular electronics;ab initio calculations;quantum chemistry;electron mobility","molecular quantum dot cellular automata;molecular electronics;quantum-chemistry ab initio analysis;Trans-Ru(dppm)/sub 2/(C=CFc)(NCCH/sub 2/CH/sub 2/NH/sub 2/) dication;bistable charge configuration;binary information;ferrocence group;Ru(dppm)/sub 2/ group;carbon-carbon triple bond;tunneling junction;external electric field;electron mobility;critical driven field","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Arrangements of cells for which any particular cell has neighbors which are not adjacent to each other generally behave as expected. Unfavorable arrangements of cells such as those with bends and crosses tend to either have incorrect outputs or be unstable for some of the possible inputs.

This research promises an interesting applicability in computation, known as quantum computation, and also in secure data communications, known as quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography capitalizes on the inherent random polarization state of single photons, which are associated with binary logic values. Because the polarization state of a photon is not reproducible by an eavesdropper between the source and the destination, polarized photons are used with an intelligent algorithm to disseminate the cryptographic key with high security from the source to the destination, a process known as quantum key distribution. However, although the polarization state of a photon remains intact in free-space propagation, it does not remain so in dielectric medium and thus quantum cryptography is not problem-free. In this paper we review quantum cryptography and we identify the various steps in the quantum key identification process. We then analyze and discuss issues related to quantum key distribution that rise in pragmatic fiber-optic transmission and in communication network topologies. In addition, we identify a major weakness of the method that is prone to attacking and which incapacitates quantum cryptography in fiber communications.","2155-7578;2155-7586","0-7803-9393","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1606087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1606087","","Cryptography;Quantum computing;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber polarization;Atom optics;Quantum mechanics;Data communication;Logic;Security;Dielectrics","optical fibre networks;optical transmitters;quantum cryptography;quantum optics;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","quantum mechanics;quantum computation;secure data communication;quantum cryptography;random polarization state;binary logic value;intelligent algorithm;cryptographic key;free-space propagation;quantum key identification process;pragmatic fiber-optic transmission;communication network topology;fiber communication;vulnerability;optical data transport","","6","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For systems having only a finite number of states, the quantum evolution equation is finite-dimensional and the results on controllability on Lie groups as worked out decades ago provide most of what is needed in so far as controllability of dissipationless systems is concerned. However, for infinite-dimensional evolution of quantum systems, many difficulties, both conceptual and technical, remain. In this paper we organize some recent results from the physics literature in control theoretic terms and emphasize the type of analysis needed to go beyond what basic differential geometry can provide. In particular, we analyze from a controllability point of view the important results of Law and Eberly, and discuss the problem of controllability of quantum systems subject to the constraint that the trajectories must lie in pre-defined subspaces. The study of this problem is motivated by recent work on the design of quantum computers that avoid loss of coherence by operating in decoherence free subspaces.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924","10.1109/CDC.2003.1272600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272600","","Controllability;Quantum computing;Physics;Communication system control;Equations;Geometry;Control system analysis;Subspace constraints;Centralized control;Electromagnetic radiation","controllability;differential geometry;Lie groups;multidimensional systems;quantum computing;Schrodinger equation;differential equations;Hilbert spaces;quantum communication","controllability;infinite quantum systems;quantum communication;quantum computation;quantum evolution equation;Lie groups;infinite dimensional evolution;differential geometry;quantum computer design;decoherence;Law-Eberly model;Hilbert spaces;Schrodinger equation","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extensive simulation results on scaling of QCA devices, such as the majority voter, the inverter and the binary wire, are provided to show that defects have definitive trends in their behavior. These trends relate cell size (l) to the smallest cell-to-cell spacing (d) for erroneous behavior in the presence of different defects (such as misalignment and displacement); their impact on the correct functionality of QCA devices is extensively discussed.

In the limit of large magnetic field, beyond the singlet-triplet transition, the singlet-triplet energy difference continues to become more negative in a circular mesa dot without any saturation whilst it is predicted to asymptotically approach zero for the rectangular mesa dot.

Accurate measurements of the flux states, especially in the time domain, require a controllable coupling between a qubit and a readout circuit (e.g., a dc SQUID magnetometer). Since the readout circuit can also be a source of decoherence, such a controllable coupling also allows one to control (minimize) the back action of the magnetometer. For this purpose we suggest a balanced, tunable transformer. This has a gradiometer configuration such that each arm is broken by a small loop containing two Josephson junctions. As a result the inductance of each arm can be adjusted by an applied bias flux. In the symmetrical case there is no coupling between the qubit and the magnetometer while a desired coupling can be achieved by changing the asymmetry of the arms. Similar transformers may be be useful for achieving controllable, lossless coupling that is required between qubits. Theoretical analysis of the noise back action of the transformer as well as preliminary experimental results are presented.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/TASC.2003.814125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211775","","Quantum computing;Tunable circuits and devices;Coupling circuits;Magnetic circuits;SQUID magnetometers;Radio frequency;Time measurement;Josephson junctions;Inductance;Arm","superconducting integrated circuits;SQUIDs;quantum computing;readout electronics;superconducting device noise","tunable transformer;qubits;flux states;RF SQUID;quantum bits;quantum computing;controllable coupling;readout circuit;decoherence;gradiometer configuration;Josephson junctions;applied bias flux;noise back action","","25","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a previous paper (Ong et al., 1984), the invertibility of a quantum system coupled to a weak time-dependent classical field was studied. The physical system is modeled as an infinite-dimensional bilinear system. Necessary and sufficient conditions of invertibility were derived under the assumption that the output observable is a quantum nondemolition observable (QNDO), characterized by the classical property that its expected value is equal to its measured value. In this paper necessary and sufficient conditions are developed for an observable to qualify as a QNDO; if in addition the criteria for invertibility are met, the given observable defines a quantum nondemolition filter (QNDF). The associated filtering algorithm thus separates cleanly into the choice of output observable (a QNDO) and the choice of procedure for processing the measurement outcomes. This approach has the advantage over previous schemes that no optimization is necessary. Applications to demodulation of optical signals and to the detection and monitoring of gravitational waves are envisioned.","","0-7803-7061","10.1109/CDC.2001.980114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980114","","Pollution measurement;Optical filters;Quantum computing;Sufficient conditions;Stimulated emission;Optical sensors;Position measurement;Physics;Nonlinear systems;Filtering","quantum communication;gravitational wave detectors;demodulation;filtering theory","nondemolition filters;quantum systems;continuous-time quantum-mechanical filter;weak time-dependent classical field;infinite dimensional bilinear system;sufficient conditions;quantum nondemolition observable;necessary conditions;demodulation;optical signals;gravitational waves","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach consists of first analyzing the logic capabilities of the basic tiles (inclusive of simulation) followed by logic mapping and connecting the tiles to form the desired circuit. The 3/spl times/3 QCA grid is presented as an example of basic block. Five types of tiles can be constructed using the 3/spl times/3 grid.

Harrow; Hoi-Kwong Lo","Dept. of Phys., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, MA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2004","50","2","319","327","Suppose two distant observers, Alice and Bob, share some form of entanglement - quantum correlations - in some bipartite pure quantum states. They may apply local operations and classical communication to convert one form of entanglement to another. Since entanglement is regarded as a resource in quantum information processing, it is an important question to ask how much classical communication, which is also a resource, is needed in the inter-conversion process of entanglement. In this paper, we address this important question in the many-copy case. The inter-conversion process of entanglement is usually divided into two types: concentrating the entanglement from many partially entangled states into a smaller number of maximally entangled states (i.e., singlets) and the reverse process of diluting singlets into partially entangled states. It is known that entanglement concentration requires no classical communication, but the best prior art result for diluting to N copies of a partially entangled state requires an amount of communication on the order of /spl radic/N. Our main result is to prove that this prior art result is optimal up to a constant factor; any procedure for approximately creating N partially entangled states from singlets requires /spl Omega/(/spl radic/N) bits of classical communication. Previously not even a constant bound was known for approximate entanglement transformations. We also prove a lower bound on the inefficiency of the process: to dilute singlets to N copies of a partially entangled state, the entropy of entanglement must decrease by /spl Omega/(/spl radic/N). Moreover, we introduce two new tools - /spl delta/-significant subspaces and the standard form protocol reduction in entanglement manipulations. We hope that these two new tools will be useful in other work in quantum information theory.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.822597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266805","","Costs;Quantum entanglement;Quantum mechanics;Information theory;Art;Physics;Information processing;Entropy;Protocols;National security","quantum communication;entropy;protocols","tight lower bound;classical communication cost;entanglement dilution;quantum correlations;bipartite pure quantum states;inter-conversion process;many-copy case;singlets;partially entangled states;entropy;/spl delta/-significant subspaces;protocol reduction;quantum information theory","","24","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because there is a genuine lack of compact and coherent devices which can operate in the far-infrared region the motivation exists for designing a terahertz (THz) QCL. To ensure operation in the THz region the device must conform to the extremely small energy level spacing. The time and expense of the design and production process is prohibitive, so an alternative to fabrication was necessary. The overarching goal of this innovative research is to find QCL parameter combinations which can be used to fabricate viable structures. To accomplish this goal a model was developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with sponsorship from the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate. A general multiobjective parallel evolutionary algorithm (GenMOP), developed at the Air Force Institute of Technology, was integrated to form a computer simulation which stochastically searches for feasible solutions.

The verification of controllability involves the study of the Lie algebra structure underlying the system. This study itself has proved a valuable tool to design experiments. 2) Results on the uniform generation of compact Lie groups have been applied to show that almost every set of quantum gates is universal for quantum computation. This result can be further refined by showing that the number of gates necessary to implement quantum logic operations is uniformly bounded by a value which only depends on the number of quantum bits processed. 3) Techniques of Optimal Control Theory have been employed to show that the pulses used to drive particles with spin 1/2 in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance are the optimal pulses which minimize the time of state transfer (subject to an energy constraint) and the energy (subject to a time constraint).","0191-2216","0-7803-7516","10.1109/CDC.2002.1185096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185096","","Control theory;Quantum mechanics;Quantum computing;Controllability;Constraint theory;Testing;Physics;Algebra;Logic;Optimal control","Lie groups;controllability;nuclear magnetic resonance;optimal control;Lie algebras;quantum theory;design of experiments","fundamental quantum mechanics;controllability;quantum physics;Lie algebra structure;design experiments;compact Lie groups;quantum gates;quantum computation;quantum logic operations;quantum bits;optimal control theory;spin;nuclear magnetic resonance;optimal pulses;state transfer;energy constraint","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spin accumulation induced pair breaking in superconductor attributes to the conductance increase in ferromagnet-superconductor-ferromagnet single electron transistors when the magnetization of the two ferromagnetic leads change from parallel to antiparallel configurations. From theoretical simulation, it is found that the Meservey-Tedrow effect also causes a similar conductance change since the magnetic field changes the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish the two effects in the experiment. A key feature of the Meservey-Tedrow effect is that the conductance change shows opposite sign under reverse bias. Based on this, a transport measurement through double tunnel junctions is setup with proper bias configuration, thus separating the two effects and demonstrating that spin accumulation is attained.","1944-9399","0-7803-9199","10.1109/NANO.2005.1500748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1500748","","State feedback;Single electron transistors;Enhanced magnetoresistance;Quantum computing;Magnetization;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic tunneling;Voltage;Polarization;Electrodes","single electron transistors;superconducting transistors;ferromagnetism;magnetisation","spin accumulation;ferromagnet-superconductor-ferromagnet single electron transistor;spin-based devices;information storage;quantum computing;pair breaking;conductance;magnetization;Meservey-Tedrow effect;magnetic field;energy spectra;quasiparticles;reverse bias;transport measurement;double tunnel junctions;bias configuration","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The original paper introducing teleportation established minimal requirements for classical communication and entanglement but the corresponding limits for remote state preparation have remained unknown until now: previous work has shown, however, that it not only requires less classical communication but also gives rise to a tradeoff between these two resources in the appropriate setting. We discuss this problem from first principles, including the various choices one may follow in the definitions of the actual resources. Our main result is a general method of remote state preparation for arbitrary states of many qubits, at a cost of 1 bit of classical communication and 1 bit of entanglement per qubit sent. In this ""universal"" formulation, these ebit and cbit requirements are shown to be simultaneously optimal by exhibiting a dichotomy. Our protocol then yields the exact tradeoff curve for memoryless sources of pure states (including the case of incomplete knowledge of the ensemble probabilities), based on the recently established quantum-classical tradeoff for visible quantum data compression. A variation of that method allows us to solve the even more general problem of preparing entangled states between sender and receiver (i.e., purifications of mixed state ensembles). The paper includes an extensive discussion of our results, including the impact of the choice of model on the resources, the topic of obliviousness, and an application to private quantum channels and quantum data hiding.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.839476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377492","Cryptography;entanglement;large deviations;teleportation;tradeoff","Teleportation;Quantum entanglement;Costs;Protocols;Data compression;Purification;Data encapsulation;National security;Research and development;Councils","quantum entanglement;quantum cryptography;protocols;memoryless systems;data compression;teleportation","remote state preparation;quantum state teleportation;minimal requirement;classical communication-entanglement;arbitrary state;universal formulation;dichotomy;protocol;memoryless source;pure state;quantum data compression;quantum channel-data hiding;cryptography;large deviation","","90","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recent numerical work (Ershov et al, 1997; Thibaudeau et al, 1996) has shown that at low operating temperatures or large incident photon fluxes, carriers deplete from the quantum wells near the emitter contact in a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP). This work finds a physical model (with closed form analytical expressions) which explains the recent numerical work on carrier depletion in QWIPs. The physical model found in this work is computationally much less intensive than the full numerical model, but retains the essential physics. As an example, we have considered device designs with the same periodic structure (the same compositions and layer widths) throughout the QWIP. In our physical model, the incident radiative flux was fixed, while the device behavior was studied for a varying applied bias. The current was seen to rise linearly with the applied bias in the different operating regimes, but with a different differential resistance in each operating regime. The physics behind this device characteristic was studied, and results are summarized here.","","0-7803-6472","10.1109/DRC.2000.877082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877082","","Photodetectors;Electron mobility;Voltage;Photoconductivity;Capacitors;Equations;Thermionic emission;Temperature;Physics computing;Numerical models","semiconductor quantum wells;quantum well devices;infrared detectors;semiconductor device models;electric current;electric resistance","device models;quantum well infrared photodetectors;operating temperature;incident photon flux;quantum wells;emitter contact;QWIP;carrier depletion;numerical analysis;numerical model;device design;periodic structure;layer width;device composition;incident radiative flux;device behavior;applied bias;linear current rise;operating regimes;differential resistance;device characteristic;device physics","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, when the error model is restricted to one, perfectly measured, error channel per physical qubit, quantum feedback can act to perfectly protect a stabilizer codespace. Using the stabilizer formalism we derive an explicit scheme, involving feedback and an additional constant Hamiltonian, to protect art (n-1)-qubit logical state encoded in n physical qubits. This works for both Poisson (jump) and white-noise (diffusion) measurement processes. As an example, we show that detected-spontaneous emission error correction with a driving Hamiltonian can greatly reduce the amount of redundancy required to protect a state from that which has been previously postulated.","","0-7803-7939","10.1109/PHYCON.2003.1237011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237011","","Error correction;Quantum computing;Protection;Particle measurements;Computer errors;Australia;Feedback control;State feedback;Redundancy;Control systems","feedback;measurement theory;error correction;quantum gates;Markov processes;spontaneous emission;master equation;measurement errors;quantum theory","quantum error correction;continuously detected;quantum feedback control;weak continuous measurement;error model;stabilizer code space;additional constant Hamiltonian;Poisson measurement processes;white-noise measurement processes;Markovian feedback;modified protocol;spontaneous emissions","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the capacity C/sub E/ is given by an expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel: i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs /spl rho/, of the entropy of the channel input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of /spl rho/ after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement-assisted communication - communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information - we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMCs of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.802612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035117","","Information rates;Entropy;Gaussian noise;Protocols;Memoryless systems","quantum communication;channel capacity;entropy;Gaussian noise;protocols;memoryless systems","entanglement-assisted capacity;reverse Shannon theorem;noisy quantum channel;information per channel;shared quantum entanglement;communication protocol;channel entropy;joint entropy;qubit amplitude damping channel;bosonic channel;amplification/attenuation;Gaussian noise;asymptotic behavior;entanglement-assisted communication;discrete memoryless channel;shared random information;asymptotic efficiency","","245","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Design Automation Conference (IEEE Cat. No.03CH37451)","","2003","","","324","329","Quantum circuits currently constitute a dominant model for quantum computation according to M. Nielsen and I. Chuang (2000). Our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to implement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two qubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and a small number of elementary quantum gates by A. Barenco et al. (1995) and G. Song and A. Klappenecker (2003) as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal two-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2 CNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound to 23 elementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOTs) entail multi-qubit interactions. Our analysis shows that previous known synthesis algorithms, although more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the special case of two qubits. One such algorithm according to G. Cybenko (2001) has a worst case of 61 gates of which 18 may be CNOTs. Our technique rely on the KAK decomposition from Lie theory as well as the polar and spectral (symmetric Shur) matrix decompositions from numerical analysis. They are related to the canonical decomposition of two-qubit gate with respect to the ""magic basis"" of phase-shifted Bell states by N. Khaneja et al. (2001) and M. Lewenstein et al. (2001).

One approach in simulating the wavepacket dynamics is the quantum trajectory method (QTM). Based on the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics, the QTM represents the wavepacket by an unstructured set of pseudoparticles whose trajectories are coupled by the quantum potential. The governing equations for the pseudoparticle trajectories are solved using a computationally intensive moving weighted least squares (MWLS) algorithm, and the trajectories can be computed in parallel. This paper contributes a strategy for improving the performance of wavepacket simulations using the QTM. Specifically, adaptivity is incorporated into the MWLS algorithm, and loop scheduling techniques are employed to dynamically load balance the parallel computation of the trajectories. The adaptive MWLS algorithm reduces the amount of computations without sacrificing accuracy, while adaptive loop scheduling addresses the load imbalance introduced by the algorithm and the runtime system. Results of experiments on a Linux cluster are presented to confirm that the adaptive MWLS reduces the trajectory computation time by up to 24%, and adaptive loop scheduling achieves parallel efficiencies of up to 85% when simulating a free particle.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213453","","Concurrent computing;Computational modeling;Scheduling algorithm;Processor scheduling;Quantum mechanics;Clustering algorithms;Adaptive scheduling;Physics;Hydrodynamics;Equations","physics computing;quantum theory;simulation;hydrodynamics;least squares approximations;scheduling;resource allocation;parallel programming","time-dependent wavepackets;physics;wavepacket simulations;wavepacket dynamics;parallel adaptive QTM;quantum trajectory method;hydrodynamic formulation;quantum mechanics;quantum potential;moving weighted least squares;MWLS algorithm;performance;loop scheduling techniques;dynamic load balancing;load imbalance;Linux cluster;pseudoparticle trajectories","","4","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that in type-II heterostructures with broken-gap band alignment the phonon-assisted process is the most favorable for the fast depopulation of the lower lasing states. The main peak of the electron-phonon resonance corresponds to electron transitions from the lowest electron-like subband to the top of the highest heavy-hole subband, which is spin-split and displaced from the center of the Brillouin zone due to the asymmetry of type-II InAs/GaSb DQW.

Transmitter and receiver design techniques that explicitly deal with this interference have been shown to improve substantially the performance of communication systems over radio-frequency and other ""classical"" channels. Quantum multiple-access communication channels, on the other hand, have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, an input-output model for multiple-access quantum channels relevant to optical communications is proposed. The model accounts for multiaccess interference, signal attenuation, and random noise, and can be used in the analysis and design of communication systems. Using a result from optimization, a perturbation method is developed to find the minimum achievable error probability in small-interference channels. It is shown that the quantum measurement that minimizes the error probability in a no-interference channel is robust in the presence of small multiaccess interference. The results are illustrated with numerical examples, which show that optimal quantum detectors can significantly outperform conventional detectors even for moderate levels of crosstalk.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.826637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291724","","Communication channels;Crosstalk;Error probability;Detectors;Multiple access interference;Optical transmitters;Radio transmitters;Radiofrequency interference;Radio frequency;Optical fiber communication","multi-access systems;optical communication;random noise;perturbation techniques;error statistics;quantum communication;quantum theory;multiuser channels;receivers","shared communication channel;multiple-access interference;transmitter design technique;receiver design technique;quantum multiple-access communication channel;input-output model;optical communication;signal attenuation;random noise;error probability minimization;small-interference channel;quantum measurement;optimal quantum detector;multiuser detection;perturbed optimization","","11","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The analog of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is specified (constrained least-squares frame (CLSF)) and the case in which the scaling is chosen to minimize the least-squares error (unconstrained least-squares frame (ULSF)).

In this part we show that there exist quantum codes whose probability of undetected error falls exponentially with the length of the code and derive bounds on this exponent. The lower (existence) bound is proved for stabilizer codes by a counting argument for classical self-orthogonal quaternary codes. Upper bounds are proved by linear programming. First we formulate two linear programming problems that are convenient for the analysis of specific short codes. Next we give a relaxed formulation of the problem in terms of optimization on the cone of polynomials in the Krawtchouk basis. We present two general solutions of the problem.

New nanodevices which encode information into the geometrical charge distribution of artificial (or natural) molecules have been proposed. Functional units are composed by exploiting the electrostatic coupling between neighboring devices. In these units, processing takes place by reshaping the electron density of the molecules, and not by switching electron currents. It has been proposed and demonstrated that high speed, extremely low loss logic gates (e.g. inverters, majority gates) can be realized. It will be shown that Coulomb-coupled time-invariant or stationary artificial molecules behave like nonlinear locally passive systems for small-signal excitations, thus multiple equilibria cannot be achieved by integrating them. Without multiple equilibrium write-hold-read memories, and thus signal processors, cannot be realized. However, the signal transfer-function of strongly nonlinear molecules can be varied in time by adiabatic control, called clock control. It will be shown that strongly nonlinear time-varying molecules can transform the necessary amount of clock-energy into the flow of signals, thereby enabling the network of molecules to perform multiple equilibria. It is envisaged that, by a proper integration of clock-controlled artificial molecules, universal digital signal processors can be built.","1066-1395","0-7695-0104","10.1109/GLSV.1999.757391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=757391","","Array signal processing;Quantum dots","digital signal processing chips;semiconductor quantum dots;quantum gates;nanotechnology;majority logic","time-varying control;signal processing;locally-connected quantum-dot arrays;nanodevices;geometrical charge distribution;electrostatic coupling;electron density;low loss logic gates;majority gates;Coulomb-coupled time-invariant artificial molecules;stationary artificial molecules;nonlinear locally passive systems;small-signal excitations;signal transfer-function;adiabatic control;strongly nonlinear time-varying molecules;universal digital signal processors","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Control over spins in the solid state forms the basis for nascent spintronics and quantum information technologies. There is a growing interest in the use of electronic and nuclear spins in semiconductor nanostructures as a medium for the manipulation and storage of both classical and quantum information. Spin-based electronics offer remarkable opportunities for exploiting the robustness of quantum spin states by combining standard electronics with spin-dependent effects that arise from the interactions between electrons, nuclei, and magnetic fields. Here we provide an overview of recent developments in coherent electronic spin dynamics in semiconductors and quantum structures, including a discussion of temporally- and spatially-resolved magneto-optical measurements that reveal an interesting interplay between electronic and nuclear spins. These experiments investigate the electronic, photonic, and magnetic manipulation of electron and nuclear spins in a variety of semiconductor structures and focus on investigating the underlying physics for quantum information processing in the solid state.","","0-7803-7872","10.1109/IEDM.2003.1269282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269282","","Magnetoelectronics;Electrons;Nuclear electronics;Solid state circuits;Magnetic field measurement;Semiconductor nanostructures;Magnetooptic effects","magnetoelectronics;paramagnetic resonance;nuclear spin;quantum gates;nanoelectronics;quantum optics;magneto-optical devices","semiconductor spintronics;electron spin manipulation;nuclear spin manipulation;solid state spin control;quantum information technologies;semiconductor nanostructures;information storage;quantum spin states;electrons/nuclei/magnetic fields interactions;coherent electronic spin dynamics;temporally-resolved magneto-optical measurements;spatially-resolved magneto-optical measurements;electron spin resonance;quantum information processing","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Type-II InAs-GaInSb quantum structures are attractive as the active regions in mid-infrared lasers, because they can be grown with bandgaps throughout the mid-infrared, engineered with suppressed Auger recombination and intersubband absorption, and grown lattice-matched to GaSb substrates. The efficiency of these lasers depends on the rapid transfer of carriers into the wells from the thick GaInAsSb barrier regions, which serve as separate absorbers for the 2-/spl mu/m pump. The capture rate can be investigated by exciting carriers into the barriers with an ultrafast pulse and then measuring the rise-time of the photoluminescence (PL) from the wells. The variation of the rise-time with excitation density and sample temperature yields information about the capture process.","","1-55752-634","10.1109/CLEO.2000.906729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906729","","Optical pumping;Gas lasers;Pump lasers;Quantum well lasers;Pulse measurements;Ultrafast optics;Photonic band gap;Radiative recombination;Absorption;Laser excitation","indium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;quantum well lasers;optical pumping;infrared sources;carrier mobility;photoluminescence;optical testing;semiconductor device testing","carrier capture;type-II quantum wells;optically pumped mid-infrared lasers;type-II InAs-GaInSb quantum structures;active regions;mid-infrared lasers;suppressed Auger recombination;intersubband absorption;lattice-match;GaSb substrates;rapid carrier transfer;exciting carriers;ultrafast pulse;rise-time;photoluminescence;excitation density;sample temperature;capture process;2 mum;InAs-GaInSb;GaInAsSb","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Realizable quantum computing is still well in the future due to the complexity of the quantum mechanics that govern them. In this regard, QCA-based system design is a challenging task since each cell's state must interact with all the cells that are in its energy-effective range in its clocking zone, referred to as its radius of effect. This paper proposes a design approach for majority gates to overcome the constraints imposed by the radius of effect of each cell with respect to clock controls. Radius of effect induces faults that lead to constraints on the clocking scheme of majority gates. We show majority gate structures that operate with multiple radius of effect-induced faults under a single clock control. The proposed design approach to a single clock controlled majority gate ultimately facilitate more efficient and flexible clocking schemes for complex QCA designs.","1550-5774;2377-7966","0-7695-2464","10.1109/DFTVS.2005.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1544520","","Quantum cellular automata;Clocks;Quantum computing;Quantum dots;Circuit faults;Automatic control;Electrons;Quantum mechanics;Computer architecture;Electrostatics","quantum gates;adders;logic design;cellular automata;circuit reliability;clocks;fault diagnosis;fault tolerance","QCA-based majority gate design;effect-induced fault tolerance;QCA cell structures;single clock-controlled majority gates;carry look-ahead adder;quantum computing;quantum mechanics complexity;QCA-based system design;QCA designs;flexible clocking schemes","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combined quantum mechanical and classical formalisms were used to characterize the iDQC signal, and to aid in the design of DQC imaging sequences with conventional or EPI acquisitions. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments suggest that signals from the DQCs have a higher sensitivity than those from the zero-quantum coherence (ZQC) for human brain imaging. The increase in magnetic field strength substantially enhances ZQC and DQC signal intensities, but the higher sensitivity of DQC over ZQC remains at higher fields. DQCs possess some favorable features. Their high selectivity to dipolar interactions of adjustable spatial scales and sensitivity to local susceptibility variation suggest they may be useful for detecting changes in local magnetic susceptibility such as in human brain activation, or in tumor oxygenation studies. They can also be used potentially to study short-, middle- and long-range dipolar interactions in different tissues. They have twice the sensitivity to molecular diffusion than measurements with diffusion of spins under single-quantum transition. The signal also lasts longer in the time domain.

One of the most interesting subfields of quantum optics is cavity QED - where microcavities impose nontrivial boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field and alter the matter-light interactions of quantum electrodynamics. One of the first predictions of this theory was the modification of atomic spontaneous emission rates, through the use of microcavities to alter the optical density of modes from its free-space value. This phenomenon is often known as the Purcell effect. Since this prediction, many theoretical analyses as well as experimental confirmations of this effect have been performed. Since the imposition of nontrivial boundary conditions modifies the electromagnetic Green's function, the Feynman diagrams for any QED process must be altered in a cavity, giving physical results that differ from those in free space. The author reviews some of the theory related to the calculation of thermal power spectrum. Then he discusses how a finite 2D or 3D PBG structure can be qualitatively studied using a 1D formalism, following a model originally developed by John and Wang (1991). In the context of this model, he computes the thermal power spectrum of a PBG filter in front of an emitting hot surface, as well as that of a heated PBG structure.

We consider the problem of testing these circuits, and in particular generating efficient test sets. The reversibility property significantly simplifies the problem, which is generally hard for the irreversible case. We discuss conditions for a test set to be complete, give a number of practical constructions, and consider test sets for worst-case circuits.

We have experimentally demonstrated that the two-photon probability amplitudes of photon pairs generated using spontaneous parametric down conversion from separate nonlinear crystals, under the conditions outlined above, remain independent and cannot be used to engineer more complex quantum states.

Although similar to the radial basis function (RBF) net, our computational model called quantum net (QN) has demonstrated a considerable gain in performance and efficiency in number of applications compared to RBF net.

"Teleportation as a measure of entanglement for an arbitrary state of two qubits","Grondalski; James","Div. of Theor., Los Alamos Nat. Lab., NM, USA; Div. of Theor., Los Alamos Nat.

Characterizing the entanglement of a general bipartite quantum system is a difficult problem. Most measures involve difficult extremizations and their physical motivation is not always clear. In this paper we propose an experimental measure of entanglement based on a modified version of the familiar teleportation protocol of Bennett et al. (1993). Briefly, teleportation traditionally involves two parties, Alice and Bob. Initially, Alice has a qubit in an unknown quantum state which she would like to communicate to Bob and Bob has two qubits in an entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair. To accomplish this transfer, Bob shares one qubit of his EPR pair with Alice. She then performs a joint measurement or Bell measurement on her two qubits and relays this information back to Bob over a classical channel. Bob then uses the outcome of Alice's Bell measurement to transform his qubit, with a local unitary transformation, into the original quantum state, always with a fidelity of one.","","1-55752-708","10.1109/QELS.2002.1031308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031308","","","EPR paradox;teleportation;quantum entanglement;Bell theorem","teleportation;entanglement;arbitrary state;two qubits;general bipartite quantum system;teleportation protocol;unknown quantum state;entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair;Bell measurement;classical channel;local unitary transformation;original quantum state;fidelity","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important use is made of the notion of positive definiteness of a quadratic functional - a significant concept for second order sufficiency conditions. The development continuous with a number of important results for the nonlinear optimal transfer problem. We briefly discuss the use of this approach for the computation of trajectories and propagators for quantum mechanical systems. The fact that the system evolves in a compact manifold alleviates many (stability related) boundedness difficulties that commonly affect trajectory optimization computations.

The field of femtosecond pulse shaping, in which Fourier synthesis methods are used to generate nearly arbitrarily shaped ultrafast optical waveforms according to user specification, is reviewed. An emphasis is placed on programmable Fourier transform pulse shaping methods based on the use of spatial light modulators. After the fundamental principles of pulse shaping are outlined, examples of pulse shaping using several different types of spatial fight modulators are described. Applications of pulse shaping are illustrated by drawing on experimental results in fields ranging from quantum control to optical communications. Finally, some new research directions in pulse shaping and in ultrafast optical signal processing are described. One example is the direct space-to-time (DST) pulse shaper, in which the generated output waveform is a directly scaled version of the input spatial beam profile. The DST pulse shaper is well suited to generation of ultrafast optical data packets for OTDM and in addition to its bulk optics implementation, may also be implemented in part using modified arrayed waveguide grating technology. As a second example, I illustrate nonlinear extensions of pulse shaping known as spectral holography and spectral nonlinear optics.

Real-time characterization of ultrashort optical pulses is critical for a number of important emerging applications: adaptive phase control for oscillator and amplifier optimization, quantum control with learning feedback, laser diagnostics, nonlinear pulse propagation and ultrafast spectroscopy. To date, however, most techniques that return quantitative, high resolution information about the pulse shapes do so at a sub-Hertz repetition rate. It is possible to increase the acquisition rate in certain cases by using a reduced resolution spectrogram and dedicated signal processing hardware, as has been demonstrated by Kane (1998). We present a real-time pulse measurement-device that has no moving components, requires only one-dimensional data collection, and uses a noniterative inversion algorithm. Our technique, spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER), retrieves the spectral phase of the input pulses at an update rate of greater than 15 Hz using an inexpensive linear CCD array and standard data acquisition hardware in a desktop computer that implements the simple and rapid inversion algorithm in LabView.","","1-55752-595","10.1109/CLEO.1999.834555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=834555","","Pulse measurements;Optical pulses;Pulse amplifiers;Signal processing algorithms;Laser feedback;Signal resolution;Hardware;Phased arrays;Programmable control;Adaptive control","real-time systems;pulse measurement;optical pulse generation;optical pulse shaping;light interferometry;optical arrays;CCD image sensors;data acquisition;optical information processing;signal reconstruction;laser beams;laser variables measurement;physics computing","real-time measurement;ultrashort optical pulses;SPIDER;real-time characterization;adaptive phase control;amplifier optimization;oscillator optimization;quantum control;learning feedback;laser diagnostics;nonlinear pulse propagation;ultrafast spectroscopy;quantitative high resolution information;pulse shapes;sub-Hertz repetition rate;acquisition rate;reduced resolution spectrogram;signal processing hardware;real-time pulse measurement-device;one-dimensional data collection;noniterative inversion algorithm;spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction;spectral phase;input pulses;linear CCD array;standard data acquisition hardware;desktop computer;inversion algorithm;LabView","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate an intrinsic bistability in luminescence and transmission of Cr doped LiSrGaF/sub 6/ (LiSGaF) and LiSrAlF/sub 6/ (LiSAF) crystals, in which the luminescence quantum yield has a strongly nonlinear dependence on temperature T.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961785","","Optical bistability;Nonlinear optics;Luminescence;Logic;Optical switches;Telecommunication switching;Optical computing;Nonlinear equations;Chromium;Crystals","chromium;optical bistability;optical bistability;lithium compounds;lithium compounds;strontium compounds;strontium compounds;optical materials;optical materials;stimulated emission;photoluminescence;photoluminescence","Cr:LiSGaF/sub 6/;Cr:LiSAF/sub 6/ laser crystals;optical bistability;intrinsic optical bistability;optical logic elements;optical computing;physical mechanisms;nonlinearity;optical Bloch equations;local field correction;luminescence;transmission;luminescence quantum yield;strongly nonlinear dependence;temperature;LiSrGaF/sub 6/:Cr;LiSrAlF/sub 6/:Cr","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, the quantum efficiency of the MCP needs to be calculated and verified experimentally for polychromatic X-ray beams. X-ray detection in the MCP is a cascade of several processes including the absorption of the photon in the MCP material, the escape of created fast (photo, Compton, or Auger) electrons from the MCP channel walls into the channels, triggering an avalanche of secondary electrons in the microchannels, and detecting the resulted charge pulse. Because electron transport in the material is involved in this process, Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the quantum efficiency of an MCP for photon beams used in mammography, computed tomography (CT), and chest radiography. The quantum efficiency of the MCP with 5-/spl mu/m channel diameter was calculated to be 68%, 89%, and 81% at X-ray tube voltages of 45, 90, and 120 kVp, which are used in scanning slit mammography, breast CT, and chest radiography, respectively. The detection efficiencies of an MCP with 2 /spl mu/m channel diameter was calculated to be 91%, 92%, and 86% at 45, 90, and 120 kVp tube voltages, respectively. The efficiency of a recently introduced silica MCP (pure SiO/sub 2/) with 5 /spl mu/m channel diameter was calculated to be 86% and 76% at 35 kVp and 45 kVp, respectively, and is rapidly decreased at higher energies. Results of the calculations show that the detection efficiencies of the MCPs are comparable to the currently available detectors in the medical X-ray imaging.","0018-9499;1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2005.858184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1546403","Microchannel plate (MCP) detectors;Monte Carlo method;photon counting;quantum efficiency;X-ray imaging","Monte Carlo methods;X-ray detection;X-ray imaging;X-ray detectors;Computed tomography;Microchannel;Biomedical imaging;Electrons;Mammography;Radiography","X-ray detection;mammography;computerised tomography;position sensitive particle detectors;diagnostic radiography","prototype scanning-slit X-ray imaging system;microchannel plate detector;quantum efficiency;polychromatic X-ray beams;X-ray detection;MCP material;photoelectrons;Compton electron;Auger electron;MCP channel walls;electron transport;Monte Carlo simulations;photon beams;mammography;computed tomography;X-ray tube voltages;breast CT;chest radiography;pure SiO/sub 2/;medical X-ray imaging;2 micron;5 micron","","9","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

All relevant physical mechanisms are considered, including their dependence on temperature and local carrier density. Careful adjustment of material parameters leads to an excellent agreement between simulation and measurements at all temperatures. At lower temperatures, Auger recombination controls the threshold current and the differential internal efficiency. At high temperatures, the vertical electron leakage from the separate confinement layer mainly limits the laser performance. The increase of internal absorption is less important. However, all these carrier and photon loss enhancements with higher temperature are mainly triggered by the reduction of the optical gain due to wider Fermi spreading of electrons.","0018-9197;1558-1713","","10.1109/3.825885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825885","","Thermal factors;Threshold current;Laser modes;Laser theory;Computational modeling;Optical computing;Temperature measurement;Electrons;Fabry-Perot;Analytical models","indium compounds;gallium arsenide;gallium compounds;quantum well lasers;laser beams;ridge waveguides;waveguide lasers;Fabry-Perot resonators;laser modes;carrier density;optical losses;laser variables measurement;Auger effect;surface recombination;III-V semiconductors;MOCVD;vapour phase epitaxial growth;optical fabrication;band structure","self-consistent analysis;high-temperature effects;strained-layer multiquantum-well lasers;InGaAsP-InP lasers;temperature effects;threshold current;slope efficiency;commercial laser simulator;PICS3D;software;two-dimensional carrier transport;heat flux;strained quantum-well gain computation;optical waveguiding;longitudinal mode solver;physical mechanisms;temperature;local carrier density;material parameters;Auger recombination;differential internal efficiency;vertical electron leakage;separate confinement layer;laser performance;internal absorption;photon loss enhancements;optical gain;Fermi electron spreading;1.55 mum;20 to 120 C;InGaAsP-InP","","60","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The efficient computation of complex tensor contractions usually requires the generation of temporary intermediate arrays.

To optimize the performance of such computations on parallel computers, the total amount of inter-processor communication must be minimized, subject to the available memory on each processor In this paper we address the memory-constrained communication minimization problem in the context of this class of computations. Based on a framework that models the relationship between loop fusion and memory usage, we develop an approach to identify the best combination of loop fusion and data partitioning that minimizes inter-processor communication cost without exceeding the per-processor memory limit.

The physical nature of photoluminescence (PL) from semiconductor nanocrystals has been a subject of considerable debate. Earlier studies using organically-capped nanocrystals have shown that the PL arises primarily from dark excitonic states with a radiative lifetime of order microseconds. Recent advances in developing inorganically-capped nanocrystals have led to much improved quantum efficiency and thus prompted the need to reexamine radiative processes in these core/shell nanocrystals. Time-resolved PL of typical core/shell nanocrystals, however, is characterized by complex multi-exponential decays. It has been difficult to extract information on radiative processes from these measurements. We report studies of radiative recombination in core/shell nanocrystals using an experimental approach based on cavity QED and the fact that only radiative processes are affected by modifications in vacuum fluctuations. We single out radiative processes from the complex decay dynamics in time resolved PL by embedding nanocrystals in an optical microresonator and by comparing time-resolved PL obtained at energies resonant or off-resonant with relevant resonator modes. An estimated radiative lifetime of order l0 ns is obtained, indicating that a significant part of the PL arises from dipole-allowed radiative recombination in nanocrystals. Core/shell CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals with a diameter near 5 nm are fabricated by using high temperature organometallic synthesis.","1094-5695","1-55752-608","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901614","","Radiative recombination;Nanocrystals;Optical resonators;Photoluminescence;Data mining;Fluctuations;Microcavities;Resonance;Life estimation;Lifetime estimation","cadmium compounds;zinc compounds;nanotechnology;nanostructured materials;II-VI semiconductors;photoluminescence;radiative lifetimes;quantum electrodynamics;cavity resonators;optical resonators;time resolved spectra;micro-optics;excitons","semiconductor nanocrystals;cavity QED;radiative recombination;photoluminescence;organically-capped nanocrystals;dark excitonic states;radiative lifetime;inorganically-capped nanocrystals;quantum efficiency;radiative processes;core/shell nanocrystals;time-resolved photoluminescence;complex multi-exponential decays;vacuum fluctuations;complex decay dynamics;nanocrystals;optical microresonator;resonator modes;dipole-allowed radiative recombination;CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals;fabrication;high temperature organometallic synthesis;5 nm;CdSe-ZnS","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high defect rate is due to manufacturing defects, ageing, transient faults and quantum physical effects, which need to be circumvented by designing reliable architectures for the nanoscale devices. The availability of higher device count, however, allows designers to implement redundancy based defect-tolerance. However, redundant parts of the design are also affected by defects, and therefore, redundancy levels need to be suitably chosen to obtain reliable architectures. Our past work has concentrated on various structural redundancy techniques, including von Neumann's NAND multiplexing, and we have shown how to use a probabilistic model checking tool to evaluate redundancy/reliability trade-off points for such designs. In this paper, we concentrate on a specific circuit, namely, majority circuit to evaluate its redundancy-reliability trade-off. This special attention to majority circuits is motivated by the recent advances in non-silicon technologies for nanoscale computing, such as quantum dot cellular automata, which use three input majority gates as their basic logic devices. Our results in this paper show that majority circuits when multiplexed using von Neumann's technique admits lesser reliability at the same level of redundancy for small gate failure probabilities than in the case of NAND gates, and higher reliability of computation when large gate failure probabilities are considered. This is significant due to the growing importance of the majority gates in implementing various logic functions in emerging nanotechnologies.","","0-7803-8536","10.1109/NANO.2004.1392432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392432","","Redundancy;Nanoscale devices;Semiconductor device manufacture;Availability;Quantum computing;Electronics industry;Substrates;Aging;Circuit faults;Quantum dots","multiplexing;nanoelectronics;redundancy;logic gates;majority logic;probability;fault tolerant computing","reliability evaluation;von Neumann multiplexing;defect-tolerant majority circuits;semiconductor industry;high defect rate;transient faults;quantum physical effects;nanoscale devices;redundancy based defect-tolerance;probabilistic model;input majority gates;logic devices;gate failure probability;nanotechnology","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose the design and characterization of a novel complex, yet very small, QCA logic gate: the and-or-inverter (AOI) gate. The paper presents a detailed simulation-based analysis of the AOI gate, as well as the study of QCA defects and their effects at the logic level. The AOI implements a universal logic gate; all elementary gates can be implemented by the AOI gate. Moreover, many two-level logic functions can be directly implemented by a single AOI gate. The AOI gate performs quite favorably, in terms of digital logic synthesis. Unlike MV, this gate is efficiently used by existing logic-synthesis tools. Our experimental data on synthesis of complex designs show that using the AOI gate instead of MV, results in up to 23.9% logic area savings, while improving the overall delay.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.852667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542242","AOI;defect analysis;device characterization;emerging technologies;QCA;testing","Logic testing;Logic design;Quantum cellular automata;Logic gates;Quantum dots;Quantum computing;Nanotechnology;Pulse inverters;Analytical models;Logic functions","cellular automata;semiconductor quantum dots;logic design;logic circuits;circuit testing;nanoelectronics;failure analysis","gate design;quantum dot cellular automata;nanotechnology;technology mapping;logic synthesis tools;QCA logic gate;and-or-inverter gate;universal logic gate;two level logic functions;digital logic synthesis;defect analysis","","65","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we study the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. We give a formal definition of authentication in the quantum setting. Assuming A and B have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a secret, classical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables A to both encrypt and authenticate an m qubit message by encoding it into m+s qubits, where the error probability decreases exponentially in the security parameter s. The scheme requires a secret key of size 2m+O(s). To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the purity of shared EPR pairs. It has long been known that learning information about a general quantum state will necessarily disturb it. We refine this result to show that such a disturbance can be done with few side effects, allowing it to circumvent cryptographic protections. Consequently, any scheme to authenticate quantum messages must also encrypt them. In contrast, no such constraint exists classically. This reasoning has two important consequences: It allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits for authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal. Moreover, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is impossible.","0272-5428","0-7695-1822","10.1109/SFCS.2002.1181969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181969","","Authentication;Cryptography;Cryptographic protocols;Paramagnetic resonance;Computer science;Information security;Testing;Teleportation;Purification;Communication system control","quantum cryptography;message authentication;protocols;computational complexity","authentication;cryptography;sender;receiver;quantum states;quantum messages;insecure quantum channel;secret classical random key sharing;noninteractive scheme;encoding;qubits;error probability;security parameter;protocol;disturbance;digital signature","","56","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, learning control techniques have a special role to play in the manipulation of quantum dynamics phenomena. The unique capabilities of quantum systems making them amenable to learning control are (a) the ability to have very large numbers of identical systems for submission to control, (b) the high duty cycle of laboratory laser controls, and (c) the ability to observe the impact of trial controls at ultrafast time scales.

Beyond this, we envision the emergence of global 'service grids', which provide a 'market' of application-level distributed services for clients to discover and to request. We study the issue of wide-area service discovery in service grids. We start with an existing basic wide-area service discovery framework. The framework adopts a scalable architecture consisting of a hierarchy of Discovery Servers. We then identify problems with the basic framework, and propose our enhancement of query responsiveness and QoS awareness.

With these techniques, the enhanced service discovery framework will be faster in finding qualified service providers.

The field can be divided roughly into two approaches. The first seeks to utilize the unique properties of ferromagnetic materials for novel functionality in electronic devices by incorporating a magnetic element in a device structure. This approach relies on spin-dependent transport of conduction electrons for integrating a magnetic bit state with charge-based electronic technology. Applications include magnetic field sensors incorporated as read heads and integrated, nonvolatile magnetic random-access memories. The second theme is less conventional and seeks to utilize populations of spin-polarized electrons, or individual magnetic moments, for entirely new paradigms of information processing such as quantum computing. Research in these two areas finds common ground with the study of the optical and/or electronic spin transport properties of conduction electrons. This paper will focus on relatively near term applications, represented by the first, more conventional theme, and on basic principles of spin-polarized transport.","0018-9219;1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.811808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200119","","Electron optics;Optical sensors;Magnetic sensors;Quantum computing;Magnetoelectronics;Research and development;Physics;Materials science and technology;Electrical engineering;Magnetic properties","spin polarised transport;metals;magnetoelectronics","spin transport electronics;metal;spintronics;ferromagnetic material;electronic device;magnetic element;magnetic field sensor;read head;nonvolatile magnetic random access memory;magnetic moment;information processing;quantum computing","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The general analysis of the new packaging system is that of a traditional investment problem, with up front costs in terms of redesign, program rollout, etc., and expected savings over time from reduced use of packaging. Although some cost savings are expected once collection of used packaging replaces a threshold amount of new packaging purchases, costs of implementation were generally higher than predicted, and participation has been slower. The program should reduce package material costs by 30% at long-run peak usage. Because one of the primary drivers for the new system was to reduce environmental damages, the life cycle impacts of switching to the new packaging system were estimated using Carnegie Mellon University's Life Cycle Assessment method. The associated life cycle impacts suggest that energy and global warming emissions will be reduced by about 40%.

Nanoelectronic discrete devices, such as resonant tunneling diodes and transistors, single-electron transistors, bistable quantum-cells, quantum interference devices, etc. have been proposed and built. Technology and physics of the devices are reasonably well understood, but there exists a gap between device physics and nanoelectronic systems integration. In this paper it is shown that in case of local quantum coherence, i.e., if coherence is restricted to the internal dynamics of Coulomb-coupled devices, system dynamics can be described by a set of coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this case virtual charges, voltages and currents, obeying Kirchoff's equations, can be assigned to the dynamic variables of the state equations, thus circuit models can be introduced. We also show that edge-driven arrays performing ground state computing are locally passive systems if the Coulomb-coupled devices are excited by the input signals only. In order to perform signal processing or computing, external energy should be pumped into the array, and the pumped array should be locally active. Adiabatic pumping is one way of injecting energy to the signal path.","","0-7803-5482","10.1109/ISCAS.2000.857010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857010","","Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nanoscale devices;Single electron transistors;Physics;Coherence;Nonlinear equations;Resonant tunneling devices;Diodes;Interference;Coupling circuits","Nanotechnology;Coulomb blockade;Quantum interference devices;Arrays;Quantum computing;Nonlinear differential equations;Coherence;Molecular electronics","nanoelectronic systems integration;nanometer-scale electronic technology;local quantum coherence;Coulomb-coupled devices;coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations;Kirchoff equations;dynamic variables;state equations;circuit models;edge-driven arrays;pumped array;adiabatic pumping;molecular array","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When an electron spreads a part of the wave in the bonding picture and a part of the wave in the anti-bonding picture, the splitting of the wave causes the electron to behave like a ""fractional"" charge.

Statistical iterative reconstruction with accurate modeling of the noise, rather than a filtered back-projection (FBP) with low-pass filtering, is one way to deal with the problem. Estimating a noise-free sinogram to satisfy the FBP reconstruction for the Radon transform is another way. The benefits of the latter include a higher computation efficiency, more uniform spatial resolution in the reconstructed image, and less modification of the current machine configurations. In a clinic X-ray CT system, the acquired raw data must be calibrated, in addition to the logarithmic transform, to achieve the high diagnostic image quality. The calibrated projection data or sinogram no longer follow a compound Poisson distribution in general, but are close to a Gaussian distribution with signal-dependent variance. In this paper, we first investigated a relatively accurate statistical model for the sinogram data, based on several phantom experiments. Then we developed a penalized likelihood method to smooth the sinogram, which led to a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm within a reasonable computing time. The method was applied to several experimental datasets acquired at 120 kVp, 10 mA/20 mA/50 mA protocols with a GE HiSpeed multi-slice detector CT scanner and demonstrated a significant noise suppression without noticeable sacrifice of the spatial resolution.","0018-9499;1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2004.834824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344369","","Smoothing methods;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;X-ray imaging;Low pass filters;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Filtering;Image quality;Gaussian distribution","computerised tomography;dosimetry;quantum noise;image reconstruction;iterative methods;low-pass filters;Radon transforms;Gaussian distribution;phantoms;nonlinear equations","quantum noise;low dose X-ray CT imaging;statistical properties;image reconstruction;statistical iterative reconstruction;filtered back-projection;low-pass filtering;noise-free sinogram;Radon transform;computation efficiency;spatial resolution;reconstructed image;current machine configurations;clinic X-ray CT system;logarithmic transform;high diagnostic image quality;calibrated projection data;compound Poisson distribution;Gaussian distribution;signal-dependent variance;relatively accurate statistical model;phantom experiments;penalized likelihood method;nonlinear equations;iterated conditional mode algorithm;computing time;protocols;GE HiSpeed multislice detector CT scanner;noise suppression;penalized weighted least square;nonlinear sinogram smoothing","","160","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

III-V materials in general have significantly higher electron mobility than Si and can potentially play a major role along with Si in future high-speed, low-power computing. The major potential advantage of using a III-V quantum-well field-effect transistor as a logic transistor is that it can be operated under very low supply voltage (e.g., 0.5 V), and hence, lower power dissipation while still achieving very high speed. Compared to other emerging high-mobility materials, such as, carbon nanotubes and semiconductor nanowires, which require ""bottom-up"" chemical synthesis for formation and suffer from the fundamental placement problem, III-V materials are far more practical in terms of patterning. However, many significant challenges remain to be overcome before III-V materials become applicable for future high-speed, low-power logic applications. These include: (i) finding a compatible high-K gate dielectric on III-Vs, (ii) demonstrating gate length scalability below 35 nm with acceptable I/sub ON//I/sub OFF/ ratio, (iii) improving the hole mobility in III-Vs or finding the right p-channel FET for the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) configuration, and (iv) integrating III-V materials onto the Si substrate.","1550-8781;2374-8443","0-7803-9250","10.1109/CSICS.2005.1531740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531740","","III-V semiconductor materials;Nanoelectronics;Logic;FETs;Organic materials;Dielectric materials;High K dielectric materials;Electron mobility;Quantum wells;Low voltage","field effect logic circuits;nanoelectronics;III-V semiconductors;high-speed techniques;low-power electronics;high electron mobility transistors;semiconductor quantum wells;carbon nanotubes;high-k dielectric thin films;silicon","III-V nanoelectronics;high-speed logic applications;low-power logic applications;high-speed digital logic applications;low- power digital logic applications;III-V materials;higher electron mobility;III-V field-effect transistor;quantum-well field-effect transistor;logic transistor;carbon nanotubes;semiconductor nanowires;high-K gate dielectric;gate length scalability;p-channel FET;CMOS configuration","","44","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reversible computing can potentially require arbitrarily small amounts of energy. Recently several nano-scale devices which have the potential to scale, and which naturally perform reversible logic, have emerged. This paper addresses several fundamental issues that need to be addressed before any nano-scale reversible computing systems can be realized, including reliability and performance trade-offs and architecture optimization. Many nano-scale devices are limited to only near neighbor interactions, requiring careful optimization of circuits. We provide efficient fault-tolerant (FT) circuits when restricted to both 2D and 1D. Finally, we compute bounds on the entropy (and hence, heat) generated by our FT circuits and provide quantitative estimates on how large can we make our circuits before we lose any advantage over irreversible computing.","1530-0889;2158-3927","0-7695-2282","10.1109/DSN.2005.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467819","","Fault tolerance;CMOS logic circuits;Quantum computing;Logic devices;Nanoscale devices;CMOS technology;Entropy;Power dissipation;Power generation;Error analysis","fault tolerant computing;CMOS logic circuits;circuit optimisation;quantum computing;nanoelectronics","reversible computing;fault-tolerant logic;CMOS technology;power dissipation;nano-scale device;reliability;circuit optimization;fault-tolerant circuit;entropy","","7","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These uncertainties are germane in the minuscule dimension of the devices, quantum physical effects, reduced noise margins, system energy levels reaching computing thermal limits, manufacturing defects, aging, and many other factors. Defect-tolerant architectures and their reliability measures will gain importance for logic and micro-architecture designs based on nanoscale substrates. Recently, the Markov random field has been proposed as a model of computation for nanoscale logic gates. This opens up new possibilities in designing logic and architecture where the conventional Boolean logic is replaced by a notion of an energy distribution function based on Gibbs distribution. In this computational scheme, probabilities of energy levels at various gate inputs and interconnects are considered, and belief propagation is used to propagate these probability distributions from the primary inputs to the primary outputs of a Boolean network. In this paper, we take this approach further by automating this computational scheme and belief propagation algorithm. We have developed MATLAB-based libraries for fundamental logic gates that can compute probability distributions and entropies at the outputs for specified discrete input distributions and in the presence of noise at the inputs and interconnects. Our tool automates the evaluation of reliability measures of combinational logic blocks. The effectiveness of this automation is illustrated in this paper by automatically deriving various reliability results for defect-tolerant architectures, such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), cascaded TMR, and multistage iterations of these. Also, signal noise is modeled as uniform and Gaussian distributions at the inputs and interconnects, so as to evaluate reliability-redundancy tradeoffs of these architectural configurations taking into account such noise models.","1536-125X;1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2005.851290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461385","Cascaded triple modular redundancy (CTMR);entropy;Gibbs distribution;interconnect;modeling;nanotechnology;noise;reliability;triple modular redundancy (TMR)","Logic design;Mathematical model;Manufacturing;Quantum computing;Energy states;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Distributed computing;Belief propagation;Probability distribution","nanoelectronics;logic gates;combinational circuits;electronic engineering computing;Markov processes;probability;Gaussian distribution;reliability;entropy;noise","NANOLAB;defect-tolerant nanoarchitectures;manufacturing technology;germane;minuscule dimension;quantum physical effects;reduced noise margins;system energy levels;computing thermal limits;manufacturing defects;aging;logic designs;microarchitecture designs;nanoscale substrates;Markov random field;nanoscale logic gates;Boolean logic;energy distribution function;Gibbs distribution;Boolean network;propagation algorithm;MATLAB-based libraries;probability distributions;entropies;combinational logic blocks;triple modular redundancy;cascaded triple modular redundancy;multistage iterations;signal noise;Gaussian distributions;reliability-redundancy tradeoffs;architectural configurations;noise models;interconnect;nanotechnology","","24","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advantages of the new FPD make it a promising candidate for cone-beam volume computed tomography (CT) angiography (CBVCTA) imaging. The purpose of this study is to characterize a prototype FPD-based imaging system for CBVCTA applications. A prototype FPD-based CBVCTA imaging system has been designed and constructed around a modified GE 8800 CT scanner. This system is evaluated for a CBVCTA imaging task in the head and neck using four phantoms and a frozen rat. The system is first characterized in terms of linearity and dynamic range of the detector. Then, the optimal selection of kVps for CBVCTA is determined and the effect of image lag and scatter on the image quality of the CBVCTA system is evaluated.

The results indicate that the FPD-based CBVCT can achieve 2.75-1p/mm spatial resolution at 0% modulation transfer function (MTF) and provide more than enough low-contrast resolution for intravenous CBVCTA imaging in the head and neck with clinically acceptable entrance exposure level.

The second order intensity correlation function can provide evidence of the non-classical nature of an electric field, as well as information about the dynamics which produce the field. In practice, this is a conditional measurement of the probability to detect a photon given that another photon was detected in coincidence or some time before. We have measured the correlation function of the photons escaping from a strongly coupled cavity QED system consisting of a high finesse interferometer traversed by a beam of optically pumped Rb atoms. In this regime, the rate of reversible exchange of energy between the atoms and the cavity is larger than the cavity decay and spontaneous emission rates, and the saturation photon number is less than one. The correlations exhibit the non-classical features of antibunching and sub-Poissonian statistics, and an oscillation related to the exchange of energy taking place in the coupled system of atoms and cavity field. We view the initial photon detection as causing a projection of the system into a well defined initial state from which it coherently evolves back to steady state. A full characterization of this conditional evolution requires the measurement of the electric field as it evolves from the initial state.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807305","","Atomic measurements;Optical interferometry;Optical beams;Atom optics;Time measurement;Optical coupling;Laser excitation;Stimulated emission;Optical pumping;Optical saturation","quantum optics;optical pumping;quantum electrodynamics;atomic beams;rubidium","cavity QED;conditional evolution;second order intensity correlation function;photon detection probability;high finesse interferometer;strongly coupled cavity;optically pumped Rb atoms;reversible exchange of energy;antibunching;sub-Poissonian statistics;initial state;homodyne detection;Rb","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By engineering the shape of intra-cavity dielectric apertures it is possible to better confine the current and provide low-loss guiding of the optical mode, thereby approaching the desired scalability.

The advent of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) gave research on intersubband dynamics a new dimension of time resolution. THz-TDS allows the measurement of a transient polarization with subcycle time resolution thus providing full information on the intersubband response to ultrafast and nonadiabatic excitation pulses. We have investigated the dynamics of intersubband excitations in modulation n-doped AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures. Their parabolically shaped conduction band leads to equally spaced intersubband transitions, which have typical resonance frequencies between 1.5 THz and 3.0 THz. The quantum wells are modulation n-doped at about 10/sup 12/ cm/sup -2/ and have electron mobilities of about 80,000 cm/sup 2//Vs, which correspond to dephasing times of about 2 ps. The electron density in the quantum wells can be controlled electronically by Schottky grating contacts fabricated on top of the structures. In our time-resolved experiments we excite the intersubband transitions with few-cycle THz pulses. Switching the electron density within the devices gives a modulation signal, which directly shows the polarization of the electronic quantum transitions. The polarization build-up and the free induction decay are observed on nonadiabatic time-scales. The results are compared to solutions of the optical Bloch equations. In order to follow the nonadiabatic dynamics our model uses an ansatz, which goes beyond the slowly-varying envelope approximation and unveils the population dynamics at low excitation densities. As a first application for signal processing we present a THz phase modulator device.","","1-55752-706","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1034453","","Optical polarization;Pulse measurements;Electrons;Optical signal processing;Time domain analysis;Spectroscopy;Time measurement;Gallium arsenide;Resonance;Resonant frequency","aluminium compounds;gallium arsenide;III-V semiconductors;submillimetre wave spectra;time resolved spectra;conduction bands;electron density;semiconductor quantum wells;electron mobility;semiconductor heterojunctions;high-frequency effects","semiconductor heterostructures;terahertz excitation dynamics;terahertz time-domain spectroscopy;intersubband dynamics;time resolution;transient polarization;subcycle time resolution;intersubband response;nonadiabatic excitation pulses;ultrafast pulses;intersubband excitations;modulation n-doped AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures;parabolically shaped conduction band;intersubband transitions;resonance frequencies;time-resolved experiments;electron density switching;modulation signal;electronic quantum transitions;polarization build-up;free induction decay;nonadiabatic time-scales;optical Bloch equations;nonadiabatic dynamics;ansatz;slowly-varying envelope approximation;population dynamics;low excitation densities;signal processing;phase modulator device;modulation n-doped quantum wells;electron mobilities;dephasing times;Schottky grating contacts;1.5 to 3.0 THz;2 ps;AlGaAs-GaAs","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional semiconductor fabrication processes are still extremely effective. However, these methods' effectiveness will come to a halt as components shrink to atomic size. Quantum physics then start to govern device behavior. Thus a radical shift, hence upheaval (change is never easy), in computing is a foregone conclusion. But the resulting quantum computers will be tremendously powerful. As our circuits become smaller, the heat they generate becomes harder to control. Much of this heat is a result of the logic function itself, rather than simple resistive dissipation. Therefore, new forms of logic must be considered. Conservative reversible logic (CRL) can reduce the problem of energy dissipated due to logic functions and can be utilized to build quantum computers. Before that can happen, research must be done on how to utilize these gates. Also, a usable synthesis process must be designed.

Multispectral imaging systems can be used to capture multiplexed molecular signals, and can be applied to the analysis of chromogenically stained slides in brightfield mode and of samples stained with a variety of light-emitting dyes (from the visible to the NIR range) in fluorescence mode. Quantum dots make a particularly good match with this imaging technology, which is also extremely helpful for the identification and elimination of interfering autofluorescence. The ability to accurately determine the spectral qualities of dyes in-situ is also valuable. Multispectral imaging has proven to be useful for multicolor FISH, for resolving multiple species of GFP with overlapping emission spectra and for resolving red/brown double-labeled histopathology stains. The uses of spectral imaging in clinical pathology are still being explored and need to be matched to appropriate software tools. Appropriately constrained linear unmixing algorithms and novel automated tools have recently been developed to provide simple, accurate analysis procedures. Conventional hematoxylin-and-eosin-or Papanicolaou-stained pathology sections can have sufficient spectral content to allow the classification of cells of different lineage or to separate normal from neoplastic cells. Analysis of such specimens may succeed using spectral ""signatures"" and simple segmentation algorithms. The rich data sets also reward the use of more advanced analysis techniques.

Such devices are said to be inept in a precise technical sense that can be easily tested from an explicit mathematical criteria to be presented in this two-part tutorial review. Often an inept device can be redesigned into a smart device capable of computing and artificial intelligence by massaging the device's parameters, such as doping, concentration, geometrical profile, chemical moiety, etc., in accordance with the principle of local activity to be articulated in Part II. In particular, designing a smart nanodevice amounts to fine tuning the device parameters into a much smaller niche within the device's locally active parameter region called the edge of chaos where complexity abounds. Molecular and nanodevices will remain novelty toys for nanodevice specialists unless they possess realistic nonlinear circuit models so that future nano circuit designers can simulate their exotic designs as easily and accurately as current CMOS circuit designers. A mathematically consistent theory for modeling nonlinear, high-frequency nanodevices, specially those which exploited exotic tunneling and entanglement quantum mechanical effects, such as Coulomb blockade, quasi-particle dynamics, Kondo resonance, Aharonov-Bohm nonlocal interactions, etc., will require the introduction of a complete family of fundamental circuit elements as model building blocks. They are presented via a doubly periodic table of circuit elements somewhat reminiscent of Mendeleev's periodic table of chemical elements. These fundamental circuit elements can be compactly represented by a loop of four generic species of circuit elements wrapped around the surface of a torus where any higher order element having an arbitrarily high order of frequency dependence can be generated from one of them, modulo the integer 4, ad infinitum. The significance of this four-element torus is that realistic circuit models of all current and future molecular and nanodevices must necessarily build upon an appropriate subset of nonlinear circuit elements begotten from this torus.","0018-9219;1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.818319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240074","","Nonlinear circuits;Chemical elements;Semiconductor device modeling;Mathematical model;Information technology;Circuit testing;Artificial intelligence;Doping profiles;Local activities;Nanoscale devices","nonlinear network synthesis;nanoelectronics;molecular electronics;reviews;quantum interference devices","nanodevices;molecular electronics;four-element torus;tutorial review;inept device;smart nanodevice;fine tuning;locally active parameter region;edge of chaos;nonlinear circuit models;mathematically consistent theory;nonlinear high-frequency nanodevices;exotic tunneling;entanglement quantum mechanical effects;Coulomb blockade;quasi-particle dynamics;Kondo resonance;Aharonov-Bohm nonlocal interactions;doubly periodic table of circuit elements","","128","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, we explicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be transferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general decoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation. We give analytical expressions for the optimal control laws (pulse sequences). Exploitation of cross-correlation effects has recently led to the development of powerful methods in NMR spectroscopy to study very large biomolecules in solution. We demonstrate that the optimal pulse sequences provide significant gains over these state of the art methods, opening new avenues for spectroscopy of much larger proteins.

Standard integrated circuits (IC) have limitations or restrictions in size, speed, reliability, complexity and finding suitable replacements for discontinued items. Nanoscale device development and understanding has dramatically grown. One of the key properties of quantum physics that quantum computers rely on is the ability of certain atoms or nuclei to work together as quantum bits. These computing devices are a fraction of the size of typical ICs (nanoscale). Nanoscale devices developed using quantum physics principles have unlimited potential to revolutionize the methods and design of fabricated printed circuit cards and complete systems. They can replace an entire PC board or the set of PC boards that comprise a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). This would be a good and practical jumping-off point. to going direct to the complete device, system or function level. This might include a nanoscale computer (general purpose or flight control), transmitter, GPS receiver, position and/or attitude sensors in either a standalone configuration, or combined within conventional devices (e.g., a nanoscale communications suite (xmtr/rcvr, etc.). encapsulated within the Plexiglas canopy or the control yoke of an F16 rather that, behind the instrument panel or maybe the whole comm suite into the pilot's helmet.","1080-7725","0-7803-7441","10.1109/AUTEST.2002.1047958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047958","","Nanotechnology;Aircraft;Nanoscale devices;Quantum computing;Aerospace electronics;Maintenance;Standards development;Integrated circuit reliability;Physics computing;Design methodology","aircraft maintenance;nanotechnology","nanotechnology;aircraft design;aircraft maintenance;electronic system;quantum computer;Line Replaceable Unit;integrated circuit","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two basic constructions of unitary error bases are known: An algebraic construction by Knill that yields nice error bases, and a combinatorial construction by Werner that yields shift-and-multiply bases. An open problem posed by Schlingemann and Werner relates these two constructions and asks whether each nice error basis is equivalent to a shift-and-multiply basis. We solve this problem and show that the answer is negative. However, we find that nice error bases have more structure than one can anticipate from their definition. In particular, we show that nice error bases can be written in a form in which at least half of the matrix entries are 0.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.842573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397942","Hadamard matrices;Latin squares;monomial representations;Pauli matrices;unitary error bases","Quantum mechanics;Error correction codes;Information theory;Teleportation;Inspection;Engineering profession;Computer science;Combinatorial mathematics;Information processing","Hadamard matrices;error correction codes;quantum theory;combinatorial mathematics","Pauli matrices;higher-dimensional systems;unitary error bases;combinatorial construction;shift-and-multiply bases;Hadamard matrices;Latin squares;monomial representations;nice error bases","","7","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Of special interest are reversible circuits constructed from a class of reversible elements called k-CNOT (controllable NOT) gates. We review the characteristics of k-CNOT circuits and observe that traditional fault models like the stuck-at model may not accurately represent their faulty behavior or test requirements. A new fault model, the missing gate fault (MGF) model, is proposed to better represent the physical failure modes of quantum technologies. It is shown that MGFs are highly testable, and that all MGFs in an N-gate k-CNOT circuit can be detected with from one to [N/2] test vectors. A design-for-test (DFT) method to make an arbitrary circuit fully testable for MGFs using a single test vector is described. Finally, we present simulation results to determine (near) optimal test sets and DFT configurations for some benchmark circuits.","1081-7735","0-7695-2235","10.1109/ATS.2004.84","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376543","Reversible circuits;quantum circuits;fault models;missing gate faults;design for test","Circuit testing;Circuit faults;Quantum computing;Design for testability;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Computer architecture;Laboratories;Application software;Circuit simulation","logic testing;quantum gates;integrated circuit testing;design for testability;fault location;built-in self test;circuit simulation","fault testing;missing-gate faults;reversible circuits;logical reversibility;quantum circuits;k-CNOT gates;controllable NOT gates;k-CNOT circuits;stuck-at model;N-gate k-CNOT circuit;test vectors;design-for-test method","","49","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Capacity results for the discrete memoryless network","G. Kramer","Lucent Technol. Bell Labs., Murray Hill, NJ, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","1","4","21","A discrete memoryless network (DMN) is a memoryless multiterminal channel with discrete inputs and outputs. A sequence of inner bounds to the DMN capacity region is derived by using code trees. Capacity expressions are given for three classes of DMNs: (1) a single-letter expression for a class with a common output, (2) a two-letter expression for a binary-symmetric broadcast channel (BC) with partial feedback, and (3) a finite-letter expression for push-to-talk DMNs. The first result is a consequence of a new capacity outer bound for common output DMNs. The third result demonstrates that the common practice of using a time-sharing random variable does not include all time-sharing possibilities, namely, time sharing of channels. Several techniques for improving the bounds are developed: (1) causally conditioned entropy and directed information simplify the inner bounds, (2) code trellises serve as simple code trees, (3) superposition coding and binning with code trees improves rates. Numerical computations show that the last technique enlarges the best known rate regions for a multiple-access channel (MAC) and a BC, both with feedback. In addition to the rate bounds, a sequence of inner bounds to the DMN reliability function is derived. A numerical example for a two-way channel illustrates the behavior of the error exponents.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.806135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159758","","Random variables;Broadcasting;Information theory;Time sharing computer systems;Relays;Memoryless systems;Source coding;Output feedback;Entropy;Quantum computing","channel coding;random codes;memoryless systems;tree codes;broadcast channels;feedback;multiuser channels;channel capacity;telecommunication networks","capacity results;discrete memoryless network;memoryless multiterminal channel;discrete inputs;discrete outputs;inner bounds;capacity region;code trees;single-letter expression;two-letter expression;binary-symmetric broadcast channel;partial feedback;finite-letter expression;push-to-talk DMN;time-sharing random variable;channel time sharing;code trellises;superposition coding;binning;rate regions;multiple-access channel;feedback;rate bounds;DMN reliability function;two-way channel;error exponents;multiuser channels;random coding","","125","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This provides valuable information regarding the efficacy of a treatment. Specifically, this is the basis for fraction-by-fraction adaptive radiotherapy. However, dose reconstruction is only as accurate as the inputs to the computation, namely the verified fluence and the CT. Studies were conducted regarding the effects of positional errors and internal anatomy changes for a canine nasopharyngeal treatment and a prostate treatment on an abdominal phantom, respectively. It was found that energy fluence errors may or may not be detected in DV. However, even if an error was detected, the authors show that the potential effects on outcome could not possibly be addressed without a CT at the time of delivery.","1094-687X","0-7803-6465","10.1109/IEMBS.2000.900681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900681","","Image reconstruction;Computed tomography;Medical treatment;Anatomy;Imaging phantoms;Detectors;Abdomen;Cadaver;Dosimetry;Quantum computing","radiation therapy;dosimetry;computerised tomography","dose reconstruction limitations;treatment imaging;radiotherapy process;full three-dimensional dose;actual energy fluence;treatment efficacy;verified fluence;positional errors;internal anatomy changes;canine nasopharyngeal treatment;prostate treatment;abdominal phantom;energy fluence errors;adaptive radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is desirable to develop RSFQ circuits for operation at much lower temperatures, in particular to use as control and interface circuitry for superconducting qubits, and eventually for a full scale quantum computer. The total heat load is moderate - current designs generate 0.5 /spl mu/W per bias resistor, so simple RSFQ integrated circuits are easily compatible with commercial helium dilution refrigerators, and this power can readily be reduced by several orders of magnitude for complex future designs - but thermal conductivity will be a bottleneck. We present a simple model of heat flow through standard RSFQ structures. We find that circuits designed for 4 K operation can be used with little or no modification below one Kelvin. At lower temperatures however the heat generated on chip cannot be removed, and the temperature of a working circuit will rise.

Since X-rays interact with core electronic levels they can provide direct information about atomic structure. X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and related X-ray techniques are widely used at modern synchrotrons providing high-brightness X-ray beams. However, the time resolution available from synchrotrons is nearly three orders of magnitude too slow to probe atomic motion within a single vibrational period.

We have used sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy with a high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) to investigate the adsorption of a friction modifier to an iron oxide substrate and its relationship to friction reduction. Our results convincingly demonstrate a strong correlation between the adsorption of friction modifier and the reduction in friction coefficient. This is the first direct experimental correlation between the friction reduction and the surface coverage and strongly supports the theoretical model developed by Rowe and more recently by Jahanmir and Beltzer.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807383","","Friction;Lubrication;Iron;Frequency;Quantum computing;Spectroscopy;Electrodes;Testing;Phonons;Cooling","friction;adsorption;optical frequency conversion;spectroscopy;optical correlation","adsorption coefficient;friction coefficient;boundary lubrication;economical impact;friction phenomena;friction reduction;friction modifiers;solid surfaces;sum-frequency generation spectroscopy;high frequency reciprocating rig;friction modifie;iron oxide substrate;strong correlation;direct experimental correlation;surface coverage;Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The code uses a novel parallel approach to solve the Kohn-Sham equations obtained from density functional theory (DFT). This approach uses limited local communications avoiding the large global communications found in other DFT based methods. This allows our code to scale efficiently to very large processor counts and large system sizes. Computationally our method can be implemented using mainly BLAS3 routines which typically run at a very high percentage of peak speed on most computers. Our large scale quantum mechanical simulations using this method reveal new details of the orientational configuration of the magnetic moments of /spl gamma/-FeMn that are unobtainable by any other means. The understanding of the magnetic structure of /spl gamma/-FeMn is important in exchange bias, which involves the use of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer such as FeMn to pin the orientation of the magnetic moment of a proximate ferromagnetic (FM). Exchange bias is of fundamental importance in magnetic multilayer storage and read head devices. Here the equation of motion of first principles SD is used to perform relaxations of model magnetic structures to the true ground (equilibrium) state. Our code has achieved a maximum execution rate of 2.46 teraflops on the IBM SP at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and 4.65 teraflops on the HP-Compaq machine at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).","1530-2075","0-7695-1926","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213465","","Computational modeling;Equations;Magnetic moments;Concurrent computing;Computer simulation;Density functional theory;Global communication;Large-scale systems;Quantum mechanics;Antiferromagnetic materials","parallel programming;spin dynamics;iron alloys;manganese alloys;density functional theory;quantum theory;magnetic moments;magnetic multilayers;physics computing","parallel multi-teraflops studies;magnetic structure;FeMn alloys;iron-manganese;Kohn-Sham equations;density functional theory;DFT;BLAS3 routines;quantum mechanical simulations;orientational configuration;magnetic moments;exchange bias;antiferromagnetic layer;proximate ferromagnetic;magnetic multilayer storage;read head devices;relaxations;true ground state;massively parallel computers;spin dynamics simulations;/spl gamma/-FeMn;Fe-Mn","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although we've long known that atoms consist of electrons surrounding a nucleus made of nucleons (protons and neutrons), we've recently learned that at a deeper level, the nucleons themselves are composites. We can best explain the strong forces between them by assuming they are composed of three quarks interacting via fields called gluons. The need for three constituents helps explain much of the zoo of similar states seen in particle physics experiments. Certain intractable aspects of the interactions between quarks and gluons have driven us to the computer. Indeed, large-scale simulations have helped us make major inroads into issues highly resistant to traditional approaches. Lattice-gauge theory provides a controlled scheme for studying strong interactions at low energies. The article shows that the main tools are powerful but demanding algorithms (such as conjugate-gradient sparse matrix inversions). Still-unsolved issues involve the ""sign"" problem and the basic formulation of parity violation on the lattice. Although we certainly need additional computing capability, we also need new ideas.","1521-9615;1558-366X","","10.1109/MCISE.2004.1267613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267613","","Lattices;Electrodynamics;Protons;Quantum mechanics;H infinity control;Solid state circuits;Joining processes;Books;Nuclear physics;HTML","quarks;gluons;physics computing;digital simulation;parallel processing;lattice field theory;gauge field theory","quark simulation;theoretical-particle physicists;lattice-gauge theory;supercomputing cycles;gluons;particle physics;large-scale simulations;conjugate-gradient sparse matrix inversions;parity violation","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signal processing potential of next-neighbor-coupled cellular nonlinear networks (CNNs) has been recently explored with the conclusion that local-activity of the cells is necessary to exhibit complexity. It will be shown that Coulomb-coupled time-invariant artificial molecules behave like nonlinear locally passive devices, thus signal-power-gain or multiple equilibria cannot be achieved by integrating them. However, the signal input-output relation of strongly nonlinear molecules can be varied in time by adiabatic pumping, called clock control.

A preliminary modification of this classification algorithm for temporal sequences is used to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained in the temporal neighborhood of a seizure episode to obtain distinct state descriptions (patient invariant characterizations) of the seizure states.

The formalism takes into account the effects of the image force potential in front of the cathode. For metals with low work-function, the Fano factor which characterizes the reduction of the shot noise power below the Schottky result is calculated as a function of the applied external electric field. Simple analytical expressions for the Fano factor are derived for the cathode operated in the thermionic (Richardson) and tunneling regimes (Fowler-Nordheim approximation). The value of the Fano factor is found to be reduced substantially below the value calculated when the effects of the image charge potential are neglected. The approach can be readily extended to include space-charge effects in the vacuum gap.","","0-7803-8397","10.1109/IVNC.2004.1354907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354907","","Cathodes;Computer science;Laboratories;Quantum computing;Impedance;Noise reduction;Electron emission;Tunneling;Nanotechnology;Fluctuations","shot noise;electron field emission","quantum-mechanical wave impedance approach;shot noise power spectrum;emission current;planar metallic cathodes;Landauer-Buttiker formalism;image force potential;work function;Fano factor;thermionic regimes;tunneling regimes;Fowler-Nordheim approximation;space-charge effects;shot noise properties;field emitters","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The LSCAT routines were used to replace the default atomic form factor and cross-section data used by EGS4 to model coherent scatter with measured molecular form factor and cross-section data. Energy deposition kernels were calculated with: (1) coherent scatter effects neglected, (2) coherent scatter effects included using the default EGS4 atomic form factor, and (3) coherent scatter effects included using the molecular form factor. These energy deposition kernels were utilized in a convolution/superposition code developed for mega-voltage therapeutic X-rays modified to compute dose at low photon energy. Depth dose calculations were made for 30 keV photons, where the coherent scatter contribution is maximum, using kernels which model coherent scatter in each of the three ways described. These calculations show a difference between the kernel that neglects coherent scatter compared to the kernels that include coherent scatter, but show no distinction between the atomic and molecular form factor kernels. A separation of the kernels into their primary and scatter components reveals that the depth dose calculation is dominated by the primary component. An examination of the kernels separated into their primary and scatter components suggest that the ""scatter sphere"" EGS4 code includes the coherent scatter contribution in the primary component of the kernel.","1094-687X","0-7803-6465","10.1109/IEMBS.2000.897914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897914","","Kernel;Electromagnetic scattering;Particle scattering;X-ray scattering;Atomic measurements;Optical computing;Atomic layer deposition;Monte Carlo methods;Convolution;Quantum computing","dosimetry;radiation therapy;photon transport theory;Monte Carlo methods;Rayleigh scattering;X-ray scattering;medical computing","energy deposition kernels;low photon energy;coherent scatter;EGS4 Monte Carlo code;low-energy photon-scattering expansion;scatter sphere EGS4 code;default EGS4 atomic form factor;molecular form factor;convolution/superposition code;megavoltage therapeutic X-rays;depth dose calculations;Rayleigh scatter","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Details of the design, fabrication, and testing are presented. A complex-coupled distributed feedback (DFB) grating is used to enable high output power. The epitaxy and chip structure are described. The paper studies what is needed to accomplish long-span transmission in terms of minimum physical requirements for laser mode control, facet reflection, index grating strength, laser-modulator matching, laser-modulator electrical isolation, modulator extinction ratio, modulator capacitance, linewidth enhancement factor, etc. The interaction of the modulator with the laser is analyzed and a requirement for this structure is computed for the electrical isolation resistance between modulator and laser contacts. Stability of the laser source is discussed and a method is derived for determining the grating's gain-coupling coefficient at operating power. Chirp due to the modulator is analyzed. Nonzero chirp of the modulator is shown to have beneficial impact on the quality of the signal after transmission. The effect of a bias-dependent alpha parameter is analyzed. Because bit-error rate is a strong function of mean alpha parameter and not a strong function of the range of alpha during nonreturn-to-zero modulation, we determine that tuning the chirp of the EML modulator to suit different fiber types (MetroCor, SMF-28, etc.) is practical. Specific tradeoffs are also required.

The Siemens Virtual Wedge (VW) delivers wedged shaped dose distributions by combining computer controlled dose delivery with collimator motion. In this paper, we describe a model to calculate dose for VW using either the Clarkson or convolution/superposition algorithms. The VW implementation models the dose generated by VW using the Siemens monitor units (MU) analytic formalism which determines the number of MU required to deliver dose at points across the VW beam. For any treatment setup, the VW algorithm generates an intensity matrix that will be used to model the modification of fluence emanating from the source. The intensity (transmission) map is calculated as the ratio of the MU delivered on the axis divided by the monitor units delivered on the central-axis MU(O); MU(O) is also the number of monitor units that is entered at the machine console.

The main disadvantage of near-infrared (NIR) tomography lies in the low spatial resolution resulting from the highly scattering nature of tissue for these wavelengths. MRI has achieved high resolution, but suffers from low specificity. In this study, NIR image reconstruction algorithms that incorporate a priori structural information provided by MRI are investigated in an attempt to optimize recovery of a simulated optical property distribution. The effect of high levels of tissue heterogeneity are evaluated to determine the limitations of incorporating prior information into a realistic set of patient breast images. We assume absorption coefficient (/spl mu//sub a/) variations near /spl plusmn/40%, and transport scattering coefficient (/spl mu//sub s//sup //) variations near /spl plusmn/20%, in a coronal breast MRI geometry. Changes in tissue pathology due to tumor growth can be observed with NIR tompgraphy, and so the goal here is to determine how best to quantify these tumor-based contrast regions within the presence of high tissue heterogeneity. By applying knowledge of tissue's layered structure in reconstruction through various constraints in the iterative algorithm, quantitative recovery of the tumor optical properties improves from 69% to 74%, and localization improves as well. However, only when the true heterogeneity of the tissue distribution was included was accurate quantification of the tumor region possible. Using a good initial guess of /spl mu//sub a/ and /spl mu//sub s//sup //, derived from the regional structure of the model, quantification of the region reaches 99% of the true value, and spatial resolution retains a similar value to the original MRI image.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2003.813304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238976","","Image reconstruction;Tomography;Breast;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optical scattering;Spatial resolution;Neoplasms;Magnetic resonance;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging","biomedical optical imaging;infrared imaging;optical tomography;biomedical MRI;image reconstruction;medical image processing;image resolution;biological tissues;mammography;biological organs;tumours","NIR tomography breast image reconstruction;a priori structural information;algorithm development;combined MRI-NIR imaging modality;near-infrared imaging;high resolution maps;optical properties;noninvasive simultaneous measurement;low spatial resolution;highly scattering nature;low specificity;simulated optical property distribution;tissue heterogeneity;absorption coefficient variations;transport scattering coefficient variations;coronal breast MRI geometry;tissue pathology;tumor growth;tumor-based contrast regions;layered structure;iterative algorithm;localization;accurate quantification;regional structure;spatial resolution","","94","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, prototype circuits for low-power applications are already being fabricated in CMOS. Regardless of the eventual technology adopted, testing is sure to be an important component in any robust implementation. We consider the test-set generation problem. Reversibility affects the testing problem in fundamental ways, making it significantly simpler than for the irreversible case.

We present efficient test-set constructions for the standard stuck-at fault model, as well as the usually intractable cell-fault model.

We are the modern-day renaissance men and women, like Edison and Da Vinci. These men could invent and create. They were artists who had a broad view of the world and saw possibilities that no one had seen before. There is no reason why we can't be like them and do even more. We understand more science and have modern tools like computers and lasers to design and build things, plus we can use information technology to gather data when we have knowledge gaps. The point is that, once we have a clear picture of who we want to be, now more than ever before, that vision is obtainable, and that vision becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy if we choose to act on it. Certainly, if we think we can't do it, we won't. I'd like to share my vision of an accomplished 21st century engineer and offer some thoughts on how to get there. I see successful engineers as people who take an early interest in science and engineering. They have alert minds and a natural curiosity for everything around them.

Specifically, when the ischemia tissue is viable reperfusion leads to improved clinical outcome. However, when the ischemic tissue is non-viable, reperfusion therapy can lead to intra-cerebral hemorrhage and/or an accelerated rate of ischemia formation. Perfusion and diffusion weighted proton MRI (DW MRI) are well-established techniques for the early detection of brain ischemia but are unable to positively establish the viability of the tissue. Tissue sodium concentration (TSC) has been shown to exhibit a linear and reversible response for many hours after ischemia onset. Because sodium accumulation in tissue is closely related to its metabolic status, we believe that the rate of TSC accumulation during evolving ischemia could provide useful information about tissue viability during evolving ischemia.

However, it is expected that nano-scale devices and interconnections will introduce unprecedented level of defects in the substrates and architectural designs need to accommodate the uncertainty inherent at such scales. This consideration motivates the search for new architectural paradigms based on redundancy based defect-tolerant designs. However, redundancy is not always a solution to the reliability problem, and often too much or too little redundancy may cause lack of reliability. The key challenge is in determining the granularity at which defect tolerance is designed, and the level of redundancy to achieve optimal reliability. Also, redundancy has been applied at different levels of granularity, such as gate level, logic block level, logic function level, unit level etc. Analytical probabilistic models to evaluate these levels are error prone and cumbersome, and do not scale well for complex network of gates. We develop different tools and techniques that can evaluate the reliability measures of combinational logic blocks, and can be used to analyze trade-offs between reliability and redundancy for different architectural configurations. In particular, we report two tools, one of which is a Matlab based tool called Nanolab and the other is a probabilistic model checking based tool named Nanoprism. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our reliability analysis tools by pointing out certain anomalies which are counter-intuitive but can be easily discovered by these tools, thereby providing better insight into defect-tolerant design decisions. We foresee that these tools will help furthering research and pedagogical interests in this area, expedite the reliability analysis process and enhance the accuracy of establishing reliability-redundancy trade-off points.","1098-7576","0-7803-8359","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1381064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381064","","Redundancy;Mathematical model;Quantum computing;Computer architecture;Fabrication;Nanoscale devices;Uncertainty;Logic gates;Logic functions;Analytical models","reliability;fault tolerant computing;circuit analysis computing;logic design;nanotechnology","reliability evaluation;defect-tolerant nano architectures;nanocomputing;nanometer fabrication technologies;analytical probabilistic models;combinational logic blocks;Matlab based tool;Nanolab;probabilistic model checking based tool;Nanoprism;reliability analysis tools","","4","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been shown that, to treat the noise in low-dose CT more accurately, both the analysis of the noise properties of the projection data and the development of a corresponding efficient filtering method are necessary. From our previous analysis of the calibrated low-dose CT projection data, it was clearly seen that the data could be regarded as approximately Gaussian distributed with nonlinear signal-dependent variance. Based on this observation, a penalized weighted least square (WLS) statistic framework was chosen for an optimal solution. In this work, we further incorporated a novel a priori idea into the framework, which can accurately preserve more information in high-noise regions with a significant reduction of the streak artifacts. This new penalty term was directly calculated from the sinogram. The method was tested by experimental data acquired at 120 kVp and 10 mA protocols, demonstrating a significant reduction on streak artifacts and noise suppression without sacrificing the spatial resolution.","1082-3654","0-7803-8257","10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1352454","","Computed tomography;Noise reduction;X-ray imaging;Image analysis;Filtering;Analysis of variance;Signal analysis;Least squares approximation;Least squares methods;Statistical distributions","computerised tomography;dosimetry;noise;least squares approximations;medical image processing","streak artifact reduction;image artifacts;excessive quantum noise;low-dose X-ray CT;noise properties;projection data;filtering method;Gaussian distribution;nonlinear signal-dependent variance;penalized weighted least square statistic framework;a priori idea;high-noise region;sinogram;protocols;noise suppression;spatial resolution","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the angular distribution of line projections at different observation points within the detector volume are reconstructed. Then, reconstruction techniques are applied to the resulting cone-beam projections to synthesize the 3D source distribution. This paper describes an analytic solution for the first, yet unsolved, task. Building on the convolution theorem in spherical coordinates, a backprojection and inverse filtering technique in terms of spherical harmonics is formulated. The rotation invariance of the point response of the backprojection in spherical coordinates is proved; and the corresponding inverse filter function is derived. The resulting filtered backprojection algorithm then consists of a summation over all detected events of fixed and known event response functions. Measurement errors, which for Compton scatter detectors are typically different for each detected event, can easily be accounted for in the proposed algorithm.

In the work described, we performed critical current I/sub c/ measurements on Josephson junctions distributed across a wafer. We then compared the J/sub c/ uniformity of pairs of wafers, fabricated together, differing only in the presence or absence of the anodization step. The cross-wafer standard deviation of J/sub c/ was typically /spl sim/5% for anodized wafers but >15% for unanodized wafers. This difference in J/sub c/ uniformity is suggestive of an in-process modification from an unknown cause that is blocked by the anodic oxide. It is interesting that small junctions do not see an improvement in I/sub c/ uniformity - apparently the anodization improves only the J/sub c/ uniformity and not the variation in junction size. Control of J/sub c/ is important for all applications of superconductive electronics including quantum computation and rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ) circuitry.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/TASC.2003.813658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211554","","Josephson junctions;Superconductivity;Quantum computing;Niobium compounds;Fabrication;Etching;Metrology;Performance evaluation;Critical current;Current measurement","critical current density (superconductivity);anodisation;Josephson effect;superconducting junction devices;niobium","critical-current-density uniformity;anodization technique;Nb superconductive electronics fabrication process;metrology techniques;NbO/sub x/ thickness determination;critical current measurements;Josephson junctions;rapid single-flux quantum circuitry;RSFQ circuitry;150 mm;Nb-NbO/sub x/-Nb","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose to employ a stream of single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses magnetically coupled to the qubit junction to momentarily suppress its critical current. This effectively lowers the barrier in the double-well rf SQUID potential thereby increasing the tunneling oscillation frequency between the wells. By carefully choosing the time interval between SFQ pulses one may accelerate the interwell tunneling rate. Thus it is possible to place the qubit into a chosen superposition of flux states and then effectively to freeze the qubit state. We present both numerical simulations and analytical time-dependent perturbation theory calculations that demonstrate the technique. Using this strategy one may control the quantum state of the rf SQUID in a way analogous to the /spl pi/ pulses in other qubit schemes.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/77.919522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=919522","","Quantum computing;SQUIDs;Energy states;Potential well;Critical current;Tunneling;Frequency;Josephson junctions;Circuits;Persistent currents","SQUIDs;perturbation theory;superconductive tunnelling;critical currents","RF SQUID;quantum control;SFQ pulse tipping;magnetic coupling;critical current;barrier lowering;double well potential;interwell tunneling oscillation frequency;superconducting qubit;flux state superposition;numerical simulation;time dependent perturbation theory;quantum computing;analytical model","","5","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We provide strong support for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely, that the minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted. Explicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on qubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with minimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using product states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image of the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the minimal entropy conjecture holds for nonunital as well as for unital maps. We also show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most product maps on n-qubit states, including all those for which at least one map is unital. For the class of unital channels on C/sup 2/, we show that additivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.44, p.269-73, 1998 and Russian Math.

Previous experiments have demonstrated pulse splitting due to the Kerr nonlinearity for short pulse propagation in bulks or gaseous media. However, studies in gaseous media are often in a focused geometry, or use pressurized gaseous media. This experiment elucidates the relationship between pulse splitting and spot-size change and does not use any optic to initiate self-focusing. We find pulse splitting occurs at a distance merely 0.7/spl times/ the diffraction length and occurs before spatial collapse to a filament. In addition, multiple pulse splitting is also observed.

Consequently, the identification and estimation of different leakage currents are very important in designing low power circuits. In the paper a methodology for accurate estimation of the total leakage in a logic circuit based on the compact modelling of the different leakage currents in nanoscaled bulk CMOS devices is demonstrated. Different leakage currents are modelled based on the device geometry, 2-D doping profile and operating temperature. A circuit level model of subthreshold, junction band-to-band tunnelling (BTBT) and gate leakage is described. The presented model includes the impact of quantum mechanical behaviour of substrate electrons on the circuit leakage. Using the compact current model, a transistor has been modelled as a sum of current sources (SCS). The SCS transistor model has been used to estimate the total leakage in simple logic gates and complex logic circuits (designed with transistors of 25 nm effective length) at room and elevated temperatures.","1350-2387","","10.1049/ip-cdt:20045084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468683","","","low-power electronics;leakage currents;CMOS logic circuits;doping profiles;semiconductor doping;logic gates;transistors;logic CAD;integrated circuit modelling;circuit analysis computing","leakage power analysis;leakage power reduction;power dissipation;CMOS circuits;threshold voltage;channel length;gate oxide thickness;low power circuit design;logic circuit;leakage current modelling;device geometry;2D doping profile;operating temperature;subthreshold junction band-to-band tunnelling;gate leakage;quantum mechanical behaviour;substrate electrons;compact current model;transistor model;25 nm","","30","","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Inst., MA, USA; NA; NA; NA; NA","Technical Digest. Summaries of Papers Presented at the Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference","","1999","","","99","","Summary form only given. Spontaneous degenerate parametric scattering [down-conversion] is a 3-photon process with one pump photon of frequency 2/spl omega/ and two output photons of frequency /spl omega/. We report the experimental observation of the down conversion with the optical vortex serving as a pump beam. An optical vortex is defined as a beam containing a phase singularity, i.e. The change of phase around the center of the beam equals 2 /spl pi/m; where the integer m is the topological charge. Each photon in the vortex beam possess orbital angular momentum L=m/spl planck/. The law of conservation of angular momentum is expected to be valid in a homogenous linear or nonlinear medium. Topological charge conservation was confirmed in second-harmonic generation experiments, and may be expected to hold under degenerate parametric scattering. However, in the quantum domain, the uncertainly relations, /spl Delta//spl phi//spl Delta/N>2/spl pi/, (where /spl phi/ is the phase and N is the number of photons) provides an opportunity to violate this conservation principle, since the phase of the two down-converted photons is undetermined to within /spl Delta//spl phi/=2/spl pi//2 for every converted fundamental photon. That is, the down converted signal may contain no information about the topological phase of the pump beam. Based on our experiments and numerical calculations of the down-converted signal we suggest that the phase information is indeed lost under down conversion, therefore violating the conservation of topological charge.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807359","","Frequency;Clocks;Optical vortices;Optical scattering;Atomic measurements;Particle scattering;Laser excitation;Uncertainty;Atomic beams;Atom lasers","optical solitons;optical harmonic generation;angular momentum theory;multiphoton processes;conservation laws","optical down conversion;conservation of topological charge;spontaneous degenerate parametric scattering;three-photon process;optical vortex;pump beam;phase singularity;phase change;orbital angular momentum;angular momentum conservation law;second-harmonic generation;quantum domain;uncertainly relations;conservation principle violation;type II phase matching","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the system to be reliable, the error of the building blocks has to be smaller than a threshold. Therefore, finding exact error thresholds for noisy gates is one of the most challenging problems in fault-tolerant computations. Under the von Neumann's probabilistic computing framework, we show that computation by circuits built out of noisy NAND gates with an arbitrary number of K inputs under worst case operation can be readily described by nonlinear discrete maps. Bifurcation analysis of such maps naturally gives the exact error thresholds above which no reliable computation is possible. It is further shown that the maximum threshold value for a K-input NAND gate is obtained when K=5. This implies that if one chooses NAND gate as basic building blocks, then the optimal number of inputs for the NAND gate may be very different from the conventional value of 2. The analysis technique generalizes to other types of gates and circuits that use voting to improve reliability, as well as a network built out of the so-called para-restituted NAND gates recently proposed by Sadek et al. Nonlinear dynamics theory offers an interesting perspective to study rich nonlinear interactions among faulty components and design nanoscale fault-tolerant architectures.","1536-125X;1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2005.851289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461386","Bifurcation;error threshold;noisy NAND gate;probabilistic/reliable computation","Bifurcation;Fault tolerance;Circuit faults;Circuit noise;Quantum computing;Fault tolerant systems;Integral equations;Voting;Aerodynamics;Computer architecture","bifurcation;fault tolerant computing;nanotechnology;noise;probability;nonlinear dynamical systems","bifurcation analysis;error bounds;fault-tolerant computations;nanotechnologies;faulty components;building blocks;exact error thresholds;noisy NAND gates;von Neumann probabilistic computing framework;nonlinear discrete maps;reliable computation;K-input NAND gate;para-restituted NAND gates;nonlinear dynamics theory;nonlinear interactions;nanoscale fault-tolerant architectures","","31","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An additive formulation that has been shown to exhibit superfill contains NaCl, 3-mercapto-1propanesulfonate (MPSA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). However, although it is recognized that copper inhibition is essential to achieve superfill, the overall mechanism and role of each additive in achieving superfill is still under debate due to the lack of understanding these processes on the molecular level.

CLEO '02. Technical Diges","","2002","","","102","103 vol.1","Summary form only given. The process of true time delay (TTD) has become a highly desired tool for processing of phased array antenna signal for beam steering and coherent detection. Typically phase shifting devices (PSD) are used in phased arrays, which produce beam squint when used at wide bandwidths (>1 GHz) and when fraction bandwidths approach 100%. The inherent problem with PSDs is that they do not impart each frequency component of the signal with the same time delay, whereas TTD device delay each frequency component by the same delay time. In this paper, we describe a novel optical coherent transient (OCT) technique for programming high bandwidth TTDs with large time-bandwidth products (TBP). Linear frequency chirped lasers significantly reduced the cost and delay programming complexity of OCT TTD, but these lasers currently lack the frequency stability needed for accumulated programming, a desired feature. Linear phase chirps, where a frequency stabilized external cavity diode laser is externally phase modulated by a chirped rf drive signal, offer the advantages of chirped lasers, plus excellent frequency stability. Linear phase chirps are easily created with integrated optical phase modulators, which can have broad bandwidths (0-40 GHz). To demonstrate the concept, we created up to 3 GHz linear phase chirps by driving our phase modulators with chirped square waves from a 12 Gbit/sec pulse pattern generator. Frequency shifts were introduced with acousto-optic modulators and time delays from 100 ns to 1 /spl mu/s were demonstrated.","","1-55752-706","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1033487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033487","","Delay effects;Frequency;Laser stability;Phased arrays;Bandwidth;Chirp modulation;Phase modulation;Linear programming;Optical pulse generation;Antenna arrays","chirp modulation;laser frequency stability;phase modulation;antenna phased arrays;optical information processing;optical coherent transients;acousto-optical modulation;beam steering","optical coherent transient true-time delay generator;linear phase chirp;phased array antenna signal processing;beam steering;coherent detection;frequency component;high bandwidth TTD;large time-bandwidth products;linear frequency chirped lasers;programming complexity;frequency stability;frequency stabilized external cavity diode laser;external phase modulation;chirped rf drive signal;integrated optical phase modulators;broad bandwidths;chirped square waves;pulse pattern generator;acousto-optic modulators;0 to 40 GHz;12 Gbit/s;100 ns to 1 mus","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An automated profiling subsystem for QoS-aware services","T. F. Abdelzaher","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Virginia Univ., Charlottesville, VA, USA","Proceedings Sixth IEEE Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium. RTAS 2000","","2000","","","208","217","The advent of QoS-sensitive Internet applications such as multimedia and the proliferation of priced performance-critical applications such as online trading raise a need for building server systems with guaranteed performance. The new applications must run on different heterogeneous platforms, provide soft performance guarantees commensurate with platform capacity and adapt efficiently to upgrades in platform resources over the system's lifetime. Profiling the application for the purposes of providing QoS guarantees on each new platform becomes a significant undertaking. Automated profiling mechanisms must be built to enable efficient computing of QoS guarantees tailored to platform capacity and facilitate wide deployment of soft performance-guaranteed systems on heterogeneous platforms. The article investigates the design of the automated profiling subsystem: an essential component of future ""general-purpose"" QoS-sensitive systems. The subsystem estimates application resource requirements and adapts the software transparently to the resource capacity of the underlying platform. A novel aspect of the proposed profiling subsystem is its use of estimation theory for profiling. Resource requirements are estimated by correlating applied workload with online resource utilization measurements. We focus explicitly on profiling server software. The convergence and accuracy of our online profiling techniques are evaluated in the context of an Apache Web server serving both static Web pages and dynamic content. Results show the viability of using estimation theory for automated online profiling and for achieving QoS guarantees.","1080-1812","0-7695-0713","10.1109/RTTAS.2000.852465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852465","","Application software;Real time systems;Web server;Estimation theory;Resource management;Embedded software;Costs;Computer architecture;Quantum computing;Computer science","real-time systems;quality of service;program diagnostics;file servers;information resources","automated profiling subsystem;QoS-aware services;QoS-sensitive Internet applications;priced performance-critical applications;online trading;server systems;guaranteed performance;heterogeneous platforms;soft performance guarantees;platform resources;automated profiling mechanisms;soft performance-guaranteed systems;general-purpose QoS-sensitive systems;application resource requirements;resource capacity;profiling subsystem;estimation theory;resource requirements;online resource utilization measurements;profiling server software;online profiling techniques;Apache Web server;static Web pages;dynamic content;automated online profiling;QoS guarantees","","23","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are three tools proposed in this study. The first tool, using a novel ""compression algorithm"" is capable of reducing any complicated series-parallel system (not complex) to a visibly easy sequence of series and parallel blocks in a reliability block diagram by first finding all existing paths, then algorithmically compressing all redundant component duplications, and finally calculating an exact reliability and creating an encoding of the topology. A second tool is to decode and retrieve an already coded s - t dependency relationship using post-fix notation for series-parallel or complex systems. A third tool is an approximate fast upper-bound (FUB) s - t reliability computing algorithm designed for series-parallel systems, to perform state enumeration in a hybrid form assisted by the Polish encoding approach on non-series-parallel complex systems to compute the exact s (source)-t (target) reliability. Various examples illustrate how these tools work satisfactorily in unison.

We have investigated the dynamics of external cavity diode lasers, (L/spl sim/1 cm or shorter), in the context of the single mode single delay Lang-Kobayashi (LK) model. We find that the laser undergoes a sequence of three Hopf bifurcations from the same external cavity mode, as the feedback rate and the roundtrip time are varied. As we increase the feedback rate a supercritical or a subcritical Hopf bifurcation occurs depending on the value of the roundtrip time. For larger feedback rates the laser stabilizes always through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, and at even larger values of the feedback rate it again destabilizes through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is related to a two mode approximate solution of the LK model. In the region between the two Hopf bifurcations the laser exhibits pulsating intensities. In addition, as the roundtrip time decreases, the two subcritical Hopf points coalesce and the steady state coexists with an isolated pulsating limit cycle. This unusual region is investigated numerically and the Hopf bifurcation boundary is computed analytically.","","0-7803-6318","10.1109/IQEC.2000.908013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908013","","Semiconductor lasers;Laser feedback;Bifurcation;Laser modes;Diode lasers;Delay;Context modeling;Laser stability;Steady-state;Limit-cycles","bifurcation;optical chaos;semiconductor lasers;laser feedback;limit cycles;laser stability;laser cavity resonators","external cavity diode lasers;pulsating intensities;single mode single delay Lang-Kobayashi model;Hopf bifurcations;external cavity mode;varied feedback rate;varied roundtrip time;supercritical bifurcation;subcritical bifurcation;two mode approximate solution;isolated pulsating limit cycle;bifurcation boundary","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though the potential of such technique has been known for many years, the challenge of extracting quickly and accurately the relevant constitutive parameters from diffraction data remains. To solve this problem, a linear inversion method has been developed. The linearization of this intrinsically non-linear problem is accomplished by seeking the departures of the constitutive parameters from their design values.","","0-7803-6319","10.1109/CLEOE.2000.910196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910196","","Radar measurements;Optical interferometry;Optical scattering;Sensor arrays;Diffraction;Reflectivity;Information analysis;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical devices;Optical sensors","light diffraction;light scattering;inverse problems;sensitivity;optimisation;periodic structures;optical information processing","optimal measurement configurations;inverse scatterometry;sensitivity;optical diffraction;periodic structures;lithographic process monitoring;diffraction data;linear inversion method;intrinsically non-linear problem;linearization;design values","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TROG is similar to frequency-resolved optical gating except that the role of time and frequency is interchanged. For the DP-TROG geometry, we show that measurements of the autocorrelation trace of the pulse after propagation through a medium with variable dispersion together with a single measurement of its intensity spectrum contain sufficient information to reconstruct the pulse in amplitude and phase. Pulse reconstruction for this DP-TROG geometry works very well even for the case of a nonlinearly chirped double pulse. Compared with other methods, DP-TROG does not introduce an ambiguity in the direction of time for the pulse. Due to its simplicity and improved sensitivity. DP-TROC is expected to be useful in characterizing low-energy pulses.","0018-9197;1558-1713","","10.1109/3.823457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823457","","Dispersion;Optical propagation;Optical sensors;Optical pulses;Pulse measurements;Frequency;Phase measurement;Geometrical optics;Information geometry;Autocorrelation","high-speed optical techniques;optical dispersion;optical correlation;sensitivity","time-resolved optical gating;dispersive propagation;optical pulses;TROG;noninterferometric method;ultrashort optical pulse amplitude;ultrashort optical pulse phase;DP-TROG geometry;autocorrelation trace;variable dispersion;intensity spectrum;pulse reconstruction;nonlinearly chirped double pulse;sensitivity;low-energy pulses","","16","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It has recently become possible to generate ultrabroadband continuum from 400 to 1600 nm with a TEM/sub 00/ spatial mode. This involves simply allowing sub-nanojoule 800 nm pulses to propagate through a short length of newly developed microstructure optical fiber, which can be nearly dispersion-free in the visible. We have made cross-correlation-FROG (XFROG) measurements of the continuum. These measurements nicely reveal the parabolic group delay of the pulse. However, the retrieved spectrum from our XFROG measurements has much more structure than the directly measured spectrum. Also, we observe fine-scale structure in the retrieved trace that is not seen in the measured trace, a clear indication that something is amiss. Usually, such poor agreement indicates that the more difficult measurement -the XFROG measurement - is contaminated with systematic error. A possible explanation for these observations is that variations in the continuum pulse from shot-to-shot, as predicted by theory, are washing out the structure in directly measured spectra and in measured XFROG traces. That the structure information somehow remains in the multishot XFROG trace is possible because some single-shot information is preserved in the XFROG trace, as all FROG traces contain substantial redundancy, and information washed out in one domain may remain in the other. Specifically, fine-scale frequency information is also present in the trace in the form of slow oscillations in delay, which are less likely to be washed out. To verify this hypothesis, we performed the first single-shot spectral measurements of the microstructure-fiber continuum.","","1-55752-706","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1034233","","Microstructure;Pollution measurement;Pulse measurements;Optical fibers;Optical pulses;Delay;Optical propagation;Optical fiber dispersion;Redundancy;Frequency","optical fibres;high-speed optical techniques;optical correlation;spectral line broadening","ultrabroadband continuum;single-shot measurements;TEM/sub 00/ spatial mode;sub-nanojoule 800 nm pulses;short length;microstructure optical fiber;dispersion-free;cross-correlation-FROG measurements;parabolic group delay;fine-scale structure;systematic error;continuum pulse;shot-to-shot;multishot XFROG trace;single-shot information;slow oscillations;800 nm;400 to 1600 nm","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sequences of random numbers are of pervasive importance in cryptography and vital to many other computing applications. Many sources of randomness, such as radioactive or quantum-mechanical sources, possess the property of stationarity. In other words, they produce independent outputs over fixed probability distributions. The output of such sources may be viewed as the result of rolling a biased or loaded die. While a biased die may be a good source of entropy, many applications require input in the form of unbiased bits, rather than biased ones. For this reason, von Neumann (1951) presented a now well-known and extensively investigated technique for using a biased coin to simulate a fair coin. We describe a new generalization of von Neumann's algorithm distinguished by its high level of practicality and amenability to analysis. In contrast to previous efforts, we are able to prove our algorithm optimally efficient, in the sense that it simulates the maximum possible number of fair coin flips for a given number of die rolls. In fact, we are able to prove that in an asymptotic sense our algorithm extracts the full entropy of its input. Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that our algorithm achieves a high level of computational and output efficiency in a practical setting.","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/18.841170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841170","","Stochastic processes","random processes;cryptography;entropy","loaded dice;fair coin flips;biased stationary randomness source;random numbers;cryptography;radioactive sources;quantum-mechanical sources;independent outputs;fixed probability distributions;biased die;entropy;biased coin;von Neumann algorithm;computational efficiency;output efficiency","","33","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results show that the quantum efficiency and detective quantum efficiency at zero frequency of such structures surpass the efficiency of conventional detector structures using the converter material as a buildup layer and depend on the dimensions of the converter structure and the active medium as well as the materials itself. In general, larger converter structures result in a higher efficiency. The detector signal is proportional to the size of the active medium in the cell.

Because of the strong focusing for such objectives, it is not clear theoretically that such a measurement should work. Such objectives can produce severe distortions of the pulse as a function of radius in the objective. In addition, the standard SHG FROG algorithms are based on the assumption that the fundamental and second harmonic fields are plane waves that can be described by the paraxial approximation, and for high NA objectives, such assumptions are suspect.

Coherent spin information can flow across interfaces of dissimilar materials in engineered structures. The interfaces appear surprisingly permeable over a broad range of temperatures, and the transport of spin information can be controlled with both electric and magnetic fields. Even in materials where momentum scattering is strongly enhanced by defects, spin coherence persists to room temperature. In order to manipulate these states, we have developed additional techniques with the potential for coherent all-optical control over electron spins in nanostructures on femtosecond time scales. Spin splittings corresponding to effective magnetic field strengths of 20 T have been produced using circularly-polarized, below-bandgap pulses with the optical Stark effect. Changes in the magnetization of resonantly tipped nuclei demonstrate the ability to perform all-optical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This sensitive and spatially selective NMR technique may serve as a basis for the coherent manipulation of nuclear moments at the atomic level.","","1-55752-708","10.1109/QELS.2002.1031359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031359","","Nanotechnology;Ultrafast optics;Nonlinear optics","nanotechnology;semiconductors;high-speed optical techniques;spin polarised transport;nonlinear optics;nuclear polarisation","semiconductor nanostructures;spin coherence manipulation;spin coherence transport;femtosecond-resolved optical experiments;spin lifetimes;coherent spin packet transport;coherent spin information;engineered structures;coherent all-optical control;circularly-polarized below-bandgap pulses;optical Stark effect;nuclear spin lifetimes;all-optical nuclear magnetic resonance;spatially selective NMR","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This isolation must be effective at frequencies around the energy level spacing, in our case from 3-8 GHz.

In this paper, a method for determining phased-array driving signals that result in a clinically favorable temperature distribution is presented. It Is shown by example that simply focusing the power deposited over the tumor is not sufficient to guarantee that the peak temperature elevation occurs in the tumor in biological media. To remedy this, the temperature is predicted by a simple computational model and directly optimized as a function of the phased-array driving signals. To facilitate this optimization, superposition principles are used for both the electromagnetic and thermal models to minimize the number of computationally Intensive forward problems that must be solved.","0018-9480;1557-9670","","10.1109/22.883863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883863","","Hyperthermia;Steady-state;Temperature;Neoplasms;Phased arrays;Computational modeling;Biology computing;Quantum computing;Biological system modeling;Electromagnetic heating","hyperthermia;antenna phased arrays;tumours;radiofrequency heating;modelling;temperature distribution;optimisation","electromagnetic phased-array driving signals determination;steady-state temperature criterion;preferential tumor heating;healthy cells;computational models;phased-array driving signals;clinically favorable temperature distribution;biological media;superposition principles;thermal model;computationally Intensive forward problems;peak temperature elevation","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The DMRT model relates physical snow parameters to brightness temperatures. The SHM simulates the mass and heat balance and provides initial guesses for the neural network. The NN is used to speed up the inversion of parameters. The retrieval algorithm can provide speedy parameter retrievals for desired temporal and spatial resolutions, Four channels of brightness temperature measurements: 19V, 19H, 37V, and 37H are used. The algorithm was applied to stations in the northern hemisphere. Two sets of results are shown. For these cases, the authors use ground-truth precipitation data, and estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) from SHM give good results.

We introduce scatter-add, which is the data-parallel form of the well-known scalar fetch-and-op, specifically tuned for SIMD/vector/stream style memory systems. The scatter-add mechanism scatters a set of data values to a set of memory addresses and adds each data value to each referenced memory location instead of overwriting it. This novel architecture extension allows us to efficiently support data-parallel atomic update computations found in parallel programming languages such as HPF, and applies both to single-processor and multiprocessor SIMD data-parallel systems.

According to this method, computations are performed in two complementary steps. During the first step, the powers of optical signals, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, and linear optical crosstalk are calculated at all points in the network. During the second step, the distortion and the overall performance of selected optical paths in the network are calculated. Each simulation step requires a different computer representation of optical signals and network components. A large part of this paper is devoted to the description of the wavelength-domain representation used during the first simulation step. In wavelength domain, optical signals are represented by their carrier wavelength and average power, exclusively. In addition, the network components are fully characterized by their loss or gain as a function of wavelength. The phase-transfer functions of the network components are discarded. These simplifications result in a dramatic increase in execution speed. During the second simulation step, optical signals are represented by their temporal waveforms. Linear optical network segments are replaced by an equivalent channel. The link between the two simulation steps is explained in detail. The remainder of the paper is devoted to the implementation of a network simulation tool based on the above method in the context of the multiwavelength optical networking (MONET) project. To illustrate the capabilities of the MONET simulator, a mesh of 4/spl times/4 wavelength-selective cross-connects (WSXCs) and wavelength add-drop multiplexers (WADMs) is studied and the crosstalk performance is determined.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.847770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847770","","Optical fiber networks;Optical crosstalk;Optical distortion;Optical noise;Computational modeling;Stimulated emission;Optical computing;Design methodology;Optical design;Large-scale systems","optical fibre networks;wavelength division multiplexing;superradiance;optical noise;optical crosstalk","wavelength domain simulation;multiwavelength optical network;design;optical transport layer;amplified spontaneous emission noise;optical crosstalk;optical distortion;wavelength selective cross-connect;wavelength add-drop multiplexer;computer model","","14","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The so-called model based algorithms (convolution, Monte Carlo) are now emerging as the dose engines of choice for 3D RTP as they can predict more accurately the dose distribution inside the patient based on the CT anatomy with minimum measured data input. In this work, we studied the effect of the dimensionality of a convolution/superposition dose algorithm on the absolute dose and relative dose distribution computed in several clinical cases and compared the outcome to Monte Carlo calculations. The convolution algorithm, calculates the dose at a point by summing together the total energy released per unit mass (TERMA) at all primary interaction sites as modified by the convolution kernel; the latter, reflects the percent of the energy released that is absorbed at the dose deposition site. Patient tissue inhomogeneity can be (i) ignored, (ii) included in the TERMA calculation only and (iii) included in both the TERMA and the convolution kernel. The resulting isodose distribution and monitor units correspond then to a homogeneous, 2.5D and 3D calculation type respectively. We used four clinical cases to study the dimensionality of the dose engine and compare to MC. We found remarkable differences between the three convolution calculation modes, but not much difference against the MC computations. The dosimetric and clinical implications in the choice of the algorithm are presented as applied to the clinical sites that were investigated.","1094-687X","0-7803-6465","10.1109/IEMBS.2000.900397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900397","","Convolution;Monte Carlo methods;Distributed computing;Engines;Kernel;Anatomy;Patient monitoring;Linear accelerators;Lungs;Quantum computing","radiation therapy;photon transport theory;Monte Carlo methods;dosimetry;medical image processing;convolution","relative dose distribution;absolute dose distribution;Monte Carlo based treatment planning;3D radiotherapy treatment planning;model based algorithms;dimensionality effect;convolution/superposition dose algorithm;total energy released per unit mass;primary interaction sites;convolution kernel;tissue inhomogeneity;isodose distribution;monitor units;prostate;brachytherapy;Pinnacle system","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Helical tomotherapy allows for irradiation of a large number of targets and region at risk (RAR) over broad regions of the body; a large-scale optimization technique is necessary. Usually a tomotherapy treatment will have tens to hundreds of thousands of pencils beams for which intensity needs to be optimized. Moreover the number of voxels where the dose needs to be computed is on the order of 1,000,000. The complexity and size of the optimization is the price paid in tomotherapy in order to obtain coplanar deliveries that are neither limited by the number of beam directions nor the degree of modulation used during delivery. It is important to note, however, that because of the simplicity and capabilities of the tomotherapy concept, a complex optimization plan will not lead to a complex delivery. The complexity of delivery is almost independent of the complexity on the optimization. In this work 4 clinical conformal and conformal avoidance optimization cases are be shown. Breast, prostate, mesothelioma and nasopharyengeal cases are presented and compared with some of the standard techniques used currently distributions and DVH's are shown to illustrate examples of the deliveries that can be achieved.

The study of optical coherence in multiple scattering media is currently receiving renewed attention because it impacts the development of optical diagnostics based on light propagation in biological tissue. New methods have been developed for characterizing the propagation of optical coherence in multiple scattering media based on the measurement of mutual coherence and Wigner functions. The Wigner function is Fourier transform related to the mutual coherence function of the field. Maximum information is obtained by polarization sensitive measurement of the transverse optical coherence to determine the field correlation functions C/sub ij/ (x, x') = (e*/sub i/(x)/spl epsiv//sub j/(x')), where i, j are the polarizations of the fields measured at transverse positions x and x'. We have developed a novel two-window heterodyne method for determining the field correlation functions by measuring the generalized Wigner functions for the optical field. In the experiments, a signal field is transmitted through or reflected from a multiple scattering medium consisting of a water-glycerol suspension of polystyrene spheres.","","1-55752-663","10.1109/QELS.2001.961973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961973","","Optical scattering;Optical mixing;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors;Light scattering;Optical propagation;Optical polarization;Position measurement;Biological tissues;Fourier transforms","light scattering;heterodyne detection;biomedical imaging;Wigner distribution;Fourier transform optics;optical correlation;suspensions","polystyrene spheres;optical coherence;multiple scattering media;optical diagnostics;light propagation;biological tissue;mutual coherence;Wigner function;polarization sensitive measurement;field correlation functions;two-window heterodyne method;Wigner functions;optical field;water-glycerol suspension;multiple scattering medium","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modes overlap in both frequency and time domains. Attempts to separate the overlapping Lamb wave signatures by conventional signal processing methods have been unsatisfactory, As might be expected, the transient nature of Lamb waves makes them readily tractable to wavelet analysis. The authors have used the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet packet transform to untangle the Lamb wave signature. Furthermore, both techniques are realizable in the highly parallel cascaded-lattice architecture, and are well suited for on-line real-time instrumentation. For signatures of Lamb waves captured in laser ultrasonic data in tailor-welded blanks, this has led to straightforward detection of weld defects and demonstration of principle that weld defects can be classified according to the type of defect as revealed by features in wavelet space. This technique has considerable commercial value for online monitoring of manufacturing processes. For example, laser-based ultrasonic (LBU) measurement shows great promise for on-line monitoring of weld quality in tailor-welded blanks. Tailor-welded blanks are steel blanks made from plates of differing thickness and/or properties butt-welded together; they are used in automobile manufacturing to produce body, frame, and closure panels.","","0-7803-7154","10.1109/SMCIA.2001.936719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936719","","Wavelet analysis;Wavelet packets;Discrete wavelet transforms;Welding;Signal analysis;Monitoring;Signal processing;Transient analysis;Instruments;Quantum cascade lasers","surface acoustic waves;instrumentation;welding;wavelet transforms;real-time systems;ultrasonic materials testing;signal processing","time domain;frequency domain;overlapping Lamb wave signature separation;transient nature;discrete wavelet transform analysis;wavelet packet transform analysis;highly parallel cascaded-lattice architecture;on-line real-time instrumentation;laser ultrasonic data;tailor-welded blanks;weld defect detection;online monitoring;manufacturing processes;laser-based ultrasonic measurement;steel blanks","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fabrication of such ultrasmall area planar SIS junctions had previously only been achieved using electron beam lithography (JPL). Typical techniques for the fabrication of micron-scale SIS junctions involve a self-aligned resist lift-off process. The resist pattern is used to define both the junction counter-electrode and the insulation field that separates the wiring layer from the base electrode. The wiring layer contacts the junction counter-electrode through a via in the insulation field that is created during resist liftoff. In our process, the junction is defined and insulated in separate steps; a via through the insulation layer to the junction is aligned and defined using a gallium focused ion beam with nanometer spot-size. Such small area SIS junctions have potential applications in high frequency SIS mixer circuits. They may also be used in experiments to investigate quantum coherence in superconducting circuits and may even serve as the key elements in future superconducting quantum computers.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/77.783719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=783719","","Fabrication;Insulation;Josephson junctions;Superconducting devices;Resists;Quantum computing;Niobium;Wiring;Circuits;Electron beams","superconductor-insulator-superconductor devices;superconductive tunnelling;focused ion beam technology;niobium;aluminium;aluminium compounds","machine-aligned fabrication;focused ion beam;Nb/Al-AlO/sub x//Nb submicron planar SIS tunnel junction;self-aligned resist lift-off process;insulation field;counter-electrode;wiring layer;base electrode;Nb-Al-AlO-Nb","","4","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Execution models such as superscalar and VLIW exploit parallelism from a single thread. Multithreaded processors make a step towards exploiting parallelism from different threads, but are not geared to exploit parallelism at different granularities (fine and medium grain). We present a feasibility study of a new execution model for exploiting both adjacent and distant parallelism in the dynamic instruction stream. Our model, called hierarchical multithreading, uses a two-level hierarchical arrangement of processing elements. The lower level of the hierarchy exploits instruction-level parallelism and fine-grain thread-level parallelism, whereas the upper level exploits more distant parallelism. Detailed simulation studies with a cycle accurate simulator are presented, showing the feasibility of hierarchical multithreading. Conclusions are drawn about the best ways to obtain the most front the hierarchical multithreading scheme.","","0-7695-1573","10.1109/IPDPS.2002.1015555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1015555","","Multithreading;Parallel processing;Read only memory;Quantum computing;Educational institutions;Biology computing;Concurrent computing;Microarchitecture;Yarn;Proposals","instruction sets;multi-threading;software performance evaluation","hierarchical multithreading;granularities;execution models;dynamic instruction stream;instruction-level parallelism;fine-grain thread-level parallelism;simulation;superscalar;VLIW;multithreaded processors;feasibility study","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Measurement of the statistical properties of a train of ultrashort optical pulses","C. Dorrer; I. A. Walmsley","Bell Labs., Holmdel, NJ, USA; NA","Summaries of Papers Presented at the Lasers and Electro-Optics. CLEO '02. Technical Diges","","2002","","","85","86 vol.1","Summary from only given. All ultrashort pulse characterization techniques are based on the assumption that a single pulse field underlies the measurement. Complete characterization of a train of pulses requires the specification of the statistical properties of the train, before an assessment can be made as to whether the assumption of identical pulses is valid. One approach is to characterize a large set of pulses from a train one at a time, and to determine the statistics from this set. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric reconstruction (SPIDER) is based on a one-dimensional interferogram and a direct algebraic reconstruction algorithm, making it by far the fastest pulse characterization technique up to now. This allows the retrieval of the electric field of a large number of pulses so that a statistical analysis can be undertaken.","","1-55752-706","10.1109/CLEO.2002.1033466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033466","","Pulse measurements;Optical pulses;Laser beams;Wavelength measurement;Lenses;Microoptics;Interference;Resists;Diode lasers;Semiconductor laser arrays","light interferometry;optical information processing;optical harmonic generation;diffraction gratings;statistical analysis;high-speed optical techniques","ultrashort pulse characterization;statistical properties;statistics;one-dimensional interferogram;direct algebraic reconstruction;fastest pulse characterization technique;electric field retrieval;statistical analysis;spectral phase interferometry for direct electric reconstruction;SPIDER","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tarn","Washington Univ., USA","IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts, 2005.","","2005","","","1","","Summary form only given. In the last few decades, a silent revolution is taking place. The exponential growth in microelectronic processing power has been achieved by ever decreasing the size of integrated circuits. These circuits which integrate electrical, mechanical and sometimes optical devices, have evolved from silicon revolution. It replaced big complex, costly systems with small, affordable, high performance microsystems. Microsystems are expected to further enable silicon chips to sense, ""think"", act, and communicate, in essence, to become intelligent machines. Structures of current microsystems are approaching fundamental limits and the next generation of devices might show unexpected properties due to quantum effects and fluctuations. A new research field is developing in which we pursue understanding of basic physics associated with such quantum structures, explore their controllability, and propose new devices. In this talk, we begin with a summary of engineering problem solving and proceed to discuss the impact of technology on the development of newly emerging discipline of soft computing and computational intelligence.

Gardner","Arizona State Univ., AZ, USA","IEEE Potentials","","2004","23","5","17","19","VLSI (very large scale integrated) chips incorporate hundreds of millions of semiconductor circuits. To predict the performance of VLSI circuits, the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the semiconductor devices are required. Semiconductor device simulation codes provide a way of predicting I-V curves as device parameters are varied, without having to fabricate the device first. Thus, many different designs for devices and circuits can be explored efficiently using computer simulations. Promising designs then can be selected for actual fabrication and testing. A fundamental approach to modeling the quantum transport of electrons and holes in semiconductor devices is the Wigner-Boltzmann equation, the quantum generalization of the Boltzmann equation. Simulating these kinetic equations is computationally expensive. Thus, a hydrodynamic approximation to the kinetic equations, where the density, velocity and temperature of a charge carrier are functions only of three spatial dimensions plus time, offers enormous computational speedups in simulating devices. The article discusses the use of classical and quantum hydrodynamic models in semiconductor device simulation.","0278-6648;1558-1772","","10.1109/MP.2004.1301241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301241","","Semiconductor devices;Hydrodynamics;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation;Very large scale integration;Equations;Kinetic theory;Predictive models;Computer simulation;Fabrication","digital simulation;semiconductor device models;hydrodynamic model (elementary particles);VLSI;electronic engineering computing","semiconductor device simulation;hydrodynamic model;VLSI;current-voltage characteristics;quantum transport;Wigner-Boltzmann equation;kinetic equations;charge carrier","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two important factors affecting the sensitivity of device electrical parameters to physical variations were quantitatively considered. The quantum effect was computed using the density gradient method and the sensitivity of threshold voltage to random dopant fluctuation was studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Our results show the 3/spl sigma/ value of V/sub T/ variation caused by discrete impurity fluctuation can be greater than 100%. Thus, engineering the work function of gate materials and maintaining a nearly intrinsic channel is more desirable. Based on a design with an intrinsic channel and ideal gate work function, we analyzed the sensitivity of device electrical parameters to several important physical fluctuations such as the variations in gate length, body thickness, and gate dielectric thickness. We found that quantum effects have great impact on the performance of devices. As a result, the device electrical behavior is sensitive to small variations of body thickness. The effect dominates over the effects produced by other physical fluctuations. To achieve a relative variation of electrical parameters comparable to present practice in industry, we face a challenge of fin width control (less than /spl sim/1 nm 3/spl sigma/ value of variation) for the 20-nm FinFET devices. The constraint of the gate length variation is about 10/spl sim/15%.

By implementing combining weights that are constant across a time slot but are updated from slot-to-slot (i.e., ""quasi-static""), great computational complexity savings can be realized compared to calculating new weights at each data block within a time slot. The quasi-static weights are computed by first modeling, the time-varying channel for each user as the superposition of multiple time-invariant channels, called Doppler channels. The weights are then calculated based on all users' Doppler channels. These new weights work by using some of the degrees of freedom of the antenna array to suppress time variations as well as multiple access interference. Despite being fixed across a time slot, these weights can equalize and suppress SDMA interference even when the channel varies significantly over the slot. Simulation results show the effectiveness of these weights for equalization and interference suppression.","1520-6149","0-7803-7041","10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940274","","Array signal processing;Multiaccess communication;Interference suppression;MIMO;Time varying systems;Frequency;Computational complexity;Quantum computing;Time-varying channels;Antenna arrays","array signal processing;time-varying channels;multiuser channels;MIMO systems;space division multiple access;Doppler effect;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;equalisers;adaptive signal processing;adaptive antenna arrays","quasi-static antenna array processing;rapidly time-varying channels;multi-user communication systems;multi-stream communication systems;MIMO systems;time-invariant channels;Doppler channels;multiple access interference;SDMA interference suppression;simulation results;equalization;time-varying frequency-selective channels;computational complexity savings;quasi-static combining weights;frequency-domain antenna combining weights","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source.

The electric field distribution and spin polarization distribution are calculated within a two-component drift-diffusion transport model. We show that an initially created narrow region of spin polarization can be further compressed and amplified near the boundary.

The control loop design is based on model-based control, previously popularized in process and other control industries. The approach is to build an a priori knowledge model, specific to the assembled package's optical power propagation characteristics, and use this to set the initial ""feed-forward"" conditions of the automation system. In addition to this feed-forward model, the controller is designed with feedback components, along with the inclusion of a built in optical power sensor. The optical modeling is performed with the rigorous scalar Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formulation, efficiently solved online using an angular spectrum technique. One of the benefits of using a knowledge-based control technique is that the efficiency of the automation process can be increased, as the number of alignment steps can be greatly reduced. An additional benefit of this technique is that it can reduce the possibility that attachment between optical components will occur at local power maximums, instead of the global maximum of the power distribution. Therefore, the technique improves system performance, while reducing the overall cost of the automation process.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2004.828476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323047","","Packaging;Automation;Power system modeling;Automatic control;Optical feedback;Optical sensors;Feedforward systems;Optical devices;Intelligent control;Process control","integrated optoelectronics;packaging;intelligent control;feedforward;optical control;optical sensors;micro-optics;optical computing;motion control","model-based optoelectronic packaging;automation;optoelectronic alignment;intelligent control theory;system-level modeling;control loop design;model-based control;a priori knowledge model;optical power propagation;feedforward model;controller;feedback components;optical power sensor;optical modeling;scalar Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formulation;angular spectrum technique;knowledge-based control;optical microsystems","","4","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, additional retiming and lateral reshaping of the original data signal can be realized along with optical clock recovery by synchronized modulation. We present a general model of jitter transfer and locking dynamics for the clock recovery circuit and compare with experimental results. Theoretical results indicate that by using hybrid integration to shorten the cavity length, nanosecond-order locking time can be achieved, which is critical for a variety of applications such as protection switching, optical burst and optical packet switching. Experimental demonstrations of 40-Gb/s optical clock recovery and its application for optical 3R regeneration are presented. The recovered 40-GHz optical clock has 500-fs timing jitter and 8-ps pulsewidth, and within 0.3 /spl mu/s locking time. 3R experiment is implemented by using the OCR combined with a subsequent regenerative wavelength converter, which provides vertical reshaping function. 3R regeneration is demonstrated with a reduced timing jitter.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2005.845609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425468","Clock recovery;electroabsorption modulator;injection locking;optical packet switching;optical signal processing;regeneration","Optical modulation;Clocks;Circuits;Ring oscillators;Repeaters;Optical character recognition software;Optical packet switching;Nonlinear optics;Synchronization;Timing jitter","synchronisation;electroabsorption;electro-optical modulation;optical fibre communication;optical communication equipment;timing jitter;injection locked oscillators;packet switching;optical information processing;optical wavelength conversion;optical pulse generation;optical pulse shaping","optical clock recovery circuits;traveling-wave modulator;electroabsorption modulator;ring oscillators;3R regeneration;synchronized optical clock;optical data signal;timing adjustments;nonlinear decision gate;reamplifying;reshaping;retiming regeneration;synchronized modulation;jitter transfer;locking dynamics;hybrid integration;cavity length shortening;nanosecond-order locking time;protection switching;optical burst;optical packet switching;optical clock recovery;optical clock;timing jitter;optical regeneration;regenerative wavelength converter;vertical reshaping function;optical signal processing;optical pulse generation;40 Gbit/s;40 GHz;500 fs;8 ps;0.3 mus","","13","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some of the limits on accuracy are due to the quantum nature of the photons, others due to the limitations of the electronic equipment used to perform the modulations. The techniques used to record the characteristics of the radiation are as important as the method by which that information is analyzed and interpreted. In each stage of the travels of the radiation, from creation and propagation to recording and analysis, the physical properties of the photons involved play a key role in the behavior of the radiation. The techniques by which these properties are modulated, monitored and recorded are also important. In this paper, these topics are discussed and weighed in detail.

The concentration versus time of the contrast agent is calculated in a single image plane on a pixel-wise basis. A number of hemodynamic parameters can be extracted from the integral of the concentration-time curve, hence a method for obtaining an efficient and accurate estimate of the area under the curve is essential for the assessment of perfusion images. A new, automatic, multilevel processing method for calculating area under the concentration-time curve is proposed. In the first level of processing, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is estimated for every pixel, and, if satisfactory, the limit points of integration are determined. An averaging filter is applied on the concentration-time curve, and the slope of the output of the filter Is calculated. The thresholds for initial and final integration points are determined next and are used to obtain limit points of integration. At this level, some pixels may be left without computed limits. These are determined at the next level of processing, using the median filter applied on the pixel neighborhood limit points. After determining limit points, the conventional method for integration is used to obtain the area under the curve. Tests of the proposed method are described for both simulated and real data. The simulated data are based on the gamma-variate function, with white noise added. The parameters used are obtained from fitting the gamma-variate function for regions within white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid in real perfusion images. The results obtained by the proposed estimator compare very favorably with the theoretical values for the particular cases studied. The performance of the proposed method for measuring cerebral hemodynamic parameters is also discussed when applied to perfusion studies in patients performed on a GE Signa 1.5 T, Advantage, whole body scanner. The results compare well with a previously used procedure based on slice-averaged time of arrival of the contrast bolus and manually determined limiting points. The new method automatizes the integration limit selection procedure efficiently, and is based on local, rather than global calculations. The procedure is simple and fast, and can perform numerical integration of 128*256 pMRI images in less than a second on a Sun SPARC 2 workstation.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/19.772203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=772203","","Hemodynamics;Filters;Magnetic resonance;Paramagnetic materials;Pixel;Signal to noise ratio;Testing;Computational modeling;White noise;Performance evaluation","biomedical MRI;medical image processing;blood flow measurement;haemorheology;brain;integration","multilevel computed hemodynamic parameter maps;dynamic perfusion MRI;rapid time-series;T2*-weighted MRI;bolus injection;paramagnetic MRI contrast agent;cerebral perfusion;concentration versus time;single image plane;pixel-wise basis;perfusion images;automatic multilevel processing method;signal-to-noise ratio;limit points of integration;averaging filter;gamma-variate function;added white noise;white matter;gray matter;cerebrospinal fluid;tissue ischaemia","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For small messages, the major issue is the minimization of software overhead, where as for large messages, the issue is network contention. Many modern large parallel computers use the fat-tree interconnection topology. We therefore analyze network contention on fat-tree networks and develop strategies to optimize collective multicast using known contention free communication schedules on fat-tree networks in the design of two strategies. We evaluate performance of these strategies with up to 256 nodes (1024 processors) on an alpha cluster. We present schemes that perform well when a contiguous chunk of nodes is not available. For large messages, many of our strategies have two times better throughput than native MPI. We also demonstrate that the software overhead of a collective operation is a small fraction of the total completion time in the presence of the communication coprocessor. We therefore compare the performance of the studied strategies using both metrics (i) completion time, and (it) computation overhead.","1521-9097","0-7695-2152","10.1109/ICPADS.2004.1316097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316097","","Network topology;Bandwidth;Design optimization;Quantum computing;Costs;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Processor scheduling;Throughput;Coprocessors","multicast communication;message passing;computer networks;performance evaluation;trees (mathematics);workstation clusters;telecommunication network topology","all-to-all multicast;fat-tree networks;software overhead;network contention;parallel computers;fat-tree interconnection topology;collective multicast;contention free communication scheduling;alpha cluster;MPI;communication coprocessor","","8","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Measuring availability indexes with small samples for component and network reliability using the Sahinoglu-Libby probability model","M. Sahinoglu; D. L. Libby; S. R. Das","Troy Univ., Montgomery, AL, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","2005","54","3","1283","1295","With the advances in pervasive computing and wireless networks, the quantitative measurements of component and network availability have become a challenging task, especially in the event of often encountered insufficient failure and repair data. It is well recognized that the Forced Outage Ratio (FOR) of an embedded hardware component is defined as the failure rate divided by the sum of the failure and the repair rates; or FOR is the operating time divided by the total exposure time. However, it is also well documented that FOR is not a constant but is a random variable. The probability density function (pdf) of the FOR is the Sahinoglu-Libby (SL) probability model, named after the originators if certain underlying assumptions hold. The SL pdf is the generalized three-parameter Beta distribution (G3B). The failure and repair rates are taken to be the generalized Gamma variables where the corresponding shape and scale parameters, respectively, are not identical. The SL model is shown to default to that of a standard two-parameter Beta pdf when the shape parameters are identical. Decision Theoretic (Bayesian) solutions are employed to compute small-sample Bayesian estimators by using informative and noninformative priors for the component failure and repair rates with respect to three definitions of loss functions. These estimators for component availability are then propagated to calculate the network expected input-output or source-target (s-t) availability for four different fundamental networks given as examples. The proposed method is superior to using a deterministic way of estimating availability simply by dividing total up-time by exposure time. Various examples will illustrate the validity of this technique to avoid over- or underestimation of availability when only small samples or insufficient data exist for the historical lifecycles of components and networks.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.847239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433207","Bayes;beta;gamma;generalized three-parameter Beta distribution (G3B);informative;loss;Sahinoglu–Libby (SL);source–target (s–t) availability","Availability;Random variables;Shape;Probability density function;Hardware;Bayesian methods;Maximum likelihood estimation;Pervasive computing;Wireless networks;Information technology","computer network reliability;probability;failure analysis;Bayes methods;decision theory","availability index measurement;component reliability;network reliability;Sahinoglu-Libby probability model;wireless networks;quantitative measurements;forced outage ratio;embedded hardware component;failure rate;repair rates;operating time;total exposure time;probability density function;generalized three parameter beta distribution;generalized gamma variables;decision theoretic solutions;small sample Bayesian estimators;informative priors;noninformative priors;loss function;input output availability;source target availability","","14","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in all quantitative SFG studies reported so far, the dynamic nature of molecules have been ignored.

The full three-dimensional transport problem is described in terms of coupled transverse subband modes which arise due to quantum confinement along the body thickness direction. Couplings among the subbands are generated for two reasons: due to spatial variations of the confinement potential along the transport direction, and due to non-alignment of the device coordinate system with the principal axes of the constant energy conduction band ellipsoids. The problem simplifies considerably if the electrostatic potential is separable along transport and confinement directions, and further if the potential variations along the transport direction are slow enough to prevent dipolar coupling (Zener tunneling) between subbands. In this limit, the transport problem can be solved by employing two unitary operators to transform an arbitrarily oriented constant energy ellipsoid into a regular ellipsoid with principal axes along the transport, width and confinement directions of the device. The effective masses for several technologically important wafer orientations for silicon and germanium are calculated in this paper.","","0-7803-8649","10.1109/IWCE.2004.1407384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407384","","MOSFETs;Wafer-scale integration;Electrostatic discharges;Silicon;Germanium compounds","MOSFET;transport processes;wafer-scale integration;electronic engineering computing;electrostatic discharge;silicon;germanium compounds;elemental semiconductors","n-MOSFET;arbitrarily oriented wafers;mass equation approach;electrostatic potential;dipolar coupling;Zener tunneling;constant energy ellipsoid;Si;Ge","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We prove that the superposition of a finite number of multiplicative multifractal traffic streams results in another multifractal stream. This property makes the multifractal traffic model a versatile tool in modeling traffic streams in computer communication networks. There, a node is loaded by a traffic flow resulting from the superposition of source streams and aggregated LRD (and other) streams. The structure and the burstiness of the superimposed process is studied, and useful mathematical relations are obtained.","","0-7803-6283","10.1109/ICC.2000.853612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=853612","","Fractals;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Communication networks;World Wide Web;Streaming media;Computer networks;Quantum computing;Packet switching;Wide area networks","Fractals;Telecommunication traffic;Computer networks;Poisson distribution;Queuing theory","multiplicative multifractal traffic streams;traffic streams superposition;source traffic streams;aggregated traffic flows;long-range-dependent properties;multifractal counting process traffic model;computer communication networks;network node;Poisson process;single server queueing system","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A critical requirement in the design of these coils is to produce a desired spatial variation of the magnetic field. In some other applications, MRI for instance, in addition to a specified spatial variation, it is also desirable to have low inductance (L) of coils to reduce switching time constants that depend on L/R where R is the coil resistance. In well-logging tools, it is often required to have uniformity of electromagnetic field along the axial direction over a specified range at a given radial distance from the tool-face. This requirement is met by placing several coils along the length of the tool. In this paper we discuss an application of genetic algorithms to determine coil position and the direction of current. A combination of FEM and superposition method is used to solve the forward problem.

Fundamental differences between RSFQ circuits and conventional semiconductor circuits, including a radical jump in clock speed, make today's processor design approaches inappropriate for HTMT.

"Parallel optical interconnection network for address transactions in large-scale cache coherent symmetric multiprocessors","A. Louri; A. K. Kodi","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Eng., Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","","2003","9","2","667","676","The authors address the primary limitation of bandwidth demands for address transaction in future cache coherent symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). As a solution, the authors propose a scalable address subnetwork called symmetric multiprocessor network (SYMNET) in which address requests and snoop responses of shared memory multiprocessors are implemented optically. As the address phase of the transaction is linked to the address bandwidth, which is the major bottleneck in SMPs, they focus only on the address subnetwork in this paper. SYMNET has the capability to pipeline address requests from successive processors, which results in increasing the available address bandwidth and lowering the latency of the network. An optical token is implemented to achieve mutual exclusion to the shared channel. This enables collisionless broadcast of multiple address requests. The simultaneous insertion of multiple address requests into the address subnetwork complicates cache coherence. A modified coherence protocol, called COSYM, was introduced to solve the coherence problem. The authors evaluated SYMNET with a subset of Splash-2 benchmarks running from 4-32 processors. Their simulation studies have shown 10%-67% improvement in execution time for various applications.

An overview of the proposed optical implementation of SYMNET is presented along with the theoretical power budget and bit-error rate analysis.

Neural Computing: New Challenges and Perspectives for the New Millennium","","2000","4","","31","36 vol.4","Years ago, many researchers proposed that chaos theory could provide a kind of universal theory of the qualitative behavior of all dynamical systems. Thus it could provide a solid mathematical foundation for unifying efforts to address the three really fundamental questions of basic science: (1) what is life?; (2) what is mind or intelligence?; (3) what are the underlying physical laws of the universe? Chaos theory is essentially a recent extension of a larger field of mathematics which it is part of: nonlinear system dynamics (NSD). It mainly addresses systems governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) or their discrete-time cousins. Because the vast bulk of models now used in computational neuroscience are ODE models, it is only natural that neuroscience has developed great interest in the use of NSD as a tool for analyzing and designing neural network models. Walter Freeman, in particular, has played a seminal role in describing how chaos theory can be used in computational neuroscience, in his classical models of the olfactory system, described in articles in Scientific American and many scientific journals and IJCNN proceedings. His colleague Morris Hirsch in mathematics has helped provide a solid foundation for this work. This work has helped to inspire many efforts throughout the world to use chaos as a design principle in computer systems and in artificial neural network (ANN) design. Recently, however, several issues or questions have begun to emerge, some at Berkeley and some in other places. The author discusses these questions and their implications.","1098-7576","0-7695-0619","10.1109/IJCNN.2000.860744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=860744","","Chaos;Complexity theory;Neuroscience;Solids;Mathematics;Computer networks;Artificial neural networks;Nonlinear systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Differential equations","chaos;neural nets;computational complexity;nonlinear dynamical systems","chaos;complexity theory;life;intelligence;chaos theory;dynamical systems;computational neuroscience;artificial neural network","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In separate accounts we have described how diffraction and dispersion can be handled individually in approximate OPO models. It is relatively straightforward to combine the diffractive and dispersive models, and we have recently done so. Briefly, we use a split-step algorithm in which dispersive/diffractive beam propagation is handled using fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods, while nonlinear mixing is computed using Runge-Kutta integration. Simulations of typical nanosecond OPO with linewidths of a few cm/sup -1/ and pump pulse durations of a few nanoseconds run on a 400 MHz personal computer in a few hours with memory demands of order 100 Mbytes. Dispersion in nanosecond OPO is usually important only if the signal and idler have broad bandwidth due to initiation from quantum noise fields, so a complete OPO model must provide a realistic simulation of the noise fields. We do this by defining as an initial condition input signal and idler noise fields that will impinge on the OPO mirrors over the time interval of the pump pulse. Each signal and idler input field mode is filled with light of random phase with a random amplitude exponentially weighted to average one photon per mode. A sufficient number of spectral modes are filled to span the acceptance bandwidth of the nonlinear crystal, and a sufficient number of spatial modes are included to span the angular acceptance of the crystal and cavity. Any input signal and idler coherent light, such as cw seed light, is added to this noise field. This makes it possible to simulate both the angular and frequency spectra of the OPO output and its pulse-to-pulse variation.","1092-8081","0-7803-5634","10.1109/LEOS.1999.811860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=811860","","Nonlinear optics;Oscillators;Optical diffraction;Optical mixing;Optical pumping;Dispersion;Computational modeling;Bandwidth;Photonic crystals;Numerical models","optical parametric oscillators;high-speed optical techniques;optical dispersion;light diffraction;fast Fourier transforms;Runge-Kutta methods;quantum noise;optical noise","modeling;nanosecond optical parametric oscillators;dispersion;diffraction;nonlinear crystal;split-step algorithm;fast Fourier transform;nonlinear mixing;Runge-Kutta integration;linewidths;pump pulse durations;signal;idler;broad bandwidth;idler noise fields;OPO mirrors;random phase;random amplitude;spectral modes;acceptance bandwidth;spatial modes;angular acceptance;cavity;idler coherent light;cw seed light;frequency spectra;pulse-to-pulse variation;400 MHz;100 Mbyte","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The roles of junction geometry, electrode purity, and interface quality are discussed and how they affect the details of N(E), hence the resulting phase dynamics. The microscopic analyses allow optimization of the performance of double-barrier Josephson junction-based rapid-single-flux-quantum circuits in two ways: 1) decreasing the switching time of Josephson elements and 2) reducing the excess wiring.

EQEC 2003 (IEEE Cat No.03TH8665)","","2003","","","259","","Summary form only given. The effect of environmental perturbations on a system of two-level atoms is to alter the coupling between the atoms and their surroundings. This manifests itself as a change in the relaxation rates of the atoms. One of the ways in which environmental fluctuations can affect an atom is to modulate its transition frequency in a stochastic manner. We study the response of such two-level atoms to irradiation by a monochromatic laser, and report the results of numerical experiments on various spectral properties, viz. the spectrum of scattered light, four-wave mixing, and fluctuations in fluorescence emission intensity. The spectrum of scattered light is a sensitive indicator of the parameters that describe the stochastic modulation. In addition, the spectra exhibit substantially different features depending on whether the stochastic process follows a diffusion or a jump-like mechanism. We also consider the modifications that are induced in four-wave mixing signals when the transition frequency of the atoms is stochastically modulated and describe how one can differentiate between Markov and non-Markov fluctuations in the transition frequency of the two-level-system through characteristics of the four-wave mixing signal. Lastly, we demonstrate that by using fluctuations in population inversion, i.e. the emission intensity, as the spectroscopic variable, one also can extract information on whether random modulation of the chromophores follows a diffusion process or a jump-like process. The population fluctuations discriminate between Markov and non-Markov fluctuations of the atomic frequency as well. In addition we show that the population inversion allows one to unambiguously determine, in certain regimes, whether the population fluctuations are due to atomic frequency noise or due to noise in the irradiating laser field. The work described here is based on a Monte-Carlo procedure, which can be applied to stochastic processes in a wide variety of biological, chemical, and physical processes.","","0-7803-7733","10.1109/EQEC.2003.1314116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1314116","","Spectroscopy;Fluctuations;Atomic beams;Stochastic processes;Four-wave mixing;Atom lasers;Light scattering;Working environment noise;Frequency modulation;Laser transitions","optical noise;light scattering;multiwave mixing;fluorescence;fluctuations;optical modulation;Markov processes;population inversion;random processes;diffusion;Monte Carlo methods;radiation pressure","noise spectroscopy;randomly modulated two-level systems;transition frequency;monochromatic laser irradiation;scattered light spectrum;four-wave mixing;fluorescence emission intensity fluctuations;stochastic modulation;Markov fluctuations;nonMarkov fluctuations;population inversion fluctuations;chromophores random modulation;diffusion process;jump-like process;atomic frequency noise;irradiating laser field noise;Monte-Carlo procedure","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have observed a novel nonlinear optical effect associated with the occupation dependence of the magnon dispersion relation, which presents the opportunity to optically manipulate and study magnetic excitations in strongly correlated insulators.","","1-55752-576","10.1109/QELS.1999.807568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=807568","","Chromium;Nonlinear optics;Optical pumping;Laser excitation;Particle beam optics;Stationary state;Antiferromagnetic materials;Pump lasers;Semiconductor materials;Spectroscopy","chromium compounds;renormalisation;magnons;spin dynamics;time resolved spectra;magneto-optical effects;strongly correlated electron systems;antiferromagnetic materials;nonlinear optics","time-resolved observation;magnon renormalization effects;nonlinear optical spectroscopy;magnon dynamics;strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulator;occupation dependence;Cr/sub 2/O/sub 3/","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The samples were subsequently magnetized in fields of 50 mT, and the remanent magnetization was measured by rastering the sample over the SQUID using a two-dimensional (2D) translation stage with a scanning range of 50 mm/spl times/50 mm. With a separation between the SQUID and sample of approximately 0.5 mm, this produced a 2D magnetic field image due to the local remanent magnetization of the sample. In addition, microstructural information was determined using optical imaging, allowing us to correlate the effects of heat treatment and mechanical stress on local remanent magnetisation with detailed microstructural information. Since the strength and integrity of steels can be well predicted from microstructural information, correlation of this information with the 2D remanent magnetization images could lead to an effective method for the non-destructive evaluation of ferromagnetic steels through a simple measurement of remanent magnetization.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/77.783929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=783929","","Magnetization;SQUIDs;Heat treatment;Steel;Stress;Magnetic field measurement;Superconducting devices;Quantum mechanics;Interference;Magnetic force microscopy","steel;ferromagnetic materials;nondestructive testing;SQUID magnetometers;microscopy;remanence;crystal microstructure;deformation;heat treatment;rolling;internal stresses;high-temperature superconductors","high-T/sub c/ SQUID microscopy;microstructure;deformation;remanent magnetization;heat treatment;mechanical stress;ferromagnetic steel;rolling;two-dimensional magnetic field imaging;nondestructive evaluation;50 mT","","14","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are compact solid-state devices that provide high quantum efficiency and gain, and they can achieve precise positioning over relatively large surfaces with few readout channels. This key feature is obtained by Anger-logic event positioning from the signals of four corner anodes printed on a resistive layer covering one of the PSAPD surface. This readout scheme provides high degree of multiplexing for reading position and energy information from the device, but leads to pincushion distortion in the spatial information due to the nonlinear charge sharing pattern associated with the potential across the resistive layer. We have developed a method to reproduce and correct this distortion based on finite-element simulations of the readout configuration. The resistive layer and the anodes are represented by a two-dimensional array of resistors and this circuit is numerically solved to obtain the signal on the four anodes for different current injection nodes. The relation between the injection positions and the resulting Anger positions is modeled and then used to correct nonlinearities in events positions obtained experimentally.

These beams have the property that their photon arrivals, as a point process, are ideally synchronized in time and space. The true image represents the spatial distribution of the optical transmittance (or reflectance) of an object. In this setup, one beam is used to probe the image while the other is used as a reference providing additional information on the actual number of photons impinging on the object. This additional information is exploited to reduce the effect of quantum noise associated with the uncertainty in the number of photons per pixel. A stochastic model for the joint statistics of the two observation matrices is developed and used to obtain a local maximum-likelihood estimator of the image. The model captures the nonideal nature of the correlation between the photons of the beams by means of a simple random translation model. The mean-square error of the estimator is evaluated and compared to the corresponding conventional techniques. Conditions for the performance advantage of the proposed estimator are examined in terms of key system parameters.

The subsystem is being developed at Stony Brook within the framework of the Hybrid Technology MultiThreading (HTMT) project. COOL-0 design is based on 0.8-/spl mu/m RSFQ technology which enables the implementation of superconductor processing elements (SPELLs) operating at clock frequencies up to 100 GHz pipelined cryo-memory (CRAM) with 30 ps cycle time and interprocessor network (CNET) with a bandwidth of 30 Gbps per channel. The main architectural challenge is an almost 1,000-fold speed difference between the RSFQ processors and room-temperature SRAM comprising the second level of the HTMT memory hierarchy. The proposed solution to the problem is hardware support for two-level multithreading and block transfer techniques in SPELLs. Our preliminary estimates show that an RSFQ subsystem with 4 K SPELLs and a 4-Gbyte CRAM may be sufficient to achieve the performance close to 0.5 petaflops for computationally intensive program kernels.

To aid tractibility, we first derive a ""bi-modal"" step function which simplifies and approximates task execution behavior. This allows for the creation of an analytic modeling function which captures the dynamic behavior of adaptive and asynchronous applications, enabling accurate predictions of runtime performance. We validate our technique using synthetic micro-benchmarks and a parallel mesh generation application and demonstrate that this technique, when used in conjunction with the PREMA runtime toolkit, can offer users significant performance improvements over several well-known load balancing tools used in practice today.","1530-2075","0-7695-2312","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419848","","Load management;Application software;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Runtime environment;Software tools;Quantum computing;Mobile computing;Informatics;Computer science","resource allocation;mesh generation;parallel processing","dynamic load balancing toolkit;analytic modeling method;asynchronous application;parallel mesh generation application;PREMA runtime toolkit","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional analysis has typically applied a worst case voltage drop at all points along a circuit path which leads to a very conservative analysis. We also show that in certain cases, the traditional analysis can be optimistic, since it ignores the possibility of voltage shifts between driver and receiver gates. In this paper, we propose a new analysis approach for computing the maximum path delay under power supply fluctuations. Our analysis is based on the use of superposition, both spatially across different circuit blocks, and temporally in time. We first present an accurate model of path delay variations under supply drops, considering both the effect of local supply reduction at individual gates and voltage shifts between driver/receiver pairs. We then formulate the path delay maximization problem as a constrained linear optimization problem, considering the effect of both IR drop and LdI/dt drops. We show how correlations between currents of different circuit blocks can be incorporated in this formulation using linear constraints. The proposed methods were implemented and tested on benchmark circuits, including an industrial power supply grid and we demonstrate a significant improvement in the worst-case path delay increase.","","1-58113-762","10.1109/ICCAD.2003.159688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257629","","Voltage;Power supplies;Driver circuits;Delay effects;Circuit testing;Circuit noise;Quantum computing;Fluctuations;Constraint optimization;Benchmark testing","power supply circuits;integrated circuit noise;delays;electric potential;optimisation","vectorless analysis;supply noise induced delay variation;power supply integrity;functional verification;worst case voltage drop;voltage shifts;driver gates;receiver gates;power supply fluctuations;path delay variations;driver/receiver pairs;path delay maximization problem;constrained linear optimization problem;IR drop effect;LdI/dt drop effect;benchmark circuits;industrial power supply grid","","24","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Perhaps the best source of information on Maxwell's life is an 1882 biography by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett. Taken from the biography, a sketch made from a watercolor that was painted from life shows Maxwell's interest in wave phenomena (the violin) even as a child. The ultimate importance of the Maxwell theory is far greater than its immediate achievement in explaining and unifying the phenomena of electricity and magnetism. Its ultimate importance is to be the prototype for all the great triumphs of twentieth-century physics. It is the prototype for Einstein's theories of relativity, for quantum mechanics and for the unified theory of fields and particles that is known as the standard model of particle physics. All these theories are based on the concept of dynamical fields, introduced by Maxwell in 1865.","1527-3342;1557-9581","","10.1109/MMW.2005.1491266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1491266","","Biographies;Maxwell equations;Libraries;Books;Optical polarization;Optical refraction;Radio frequency;Soldering;Iron;Electromagnetics","biographies;electromagnetic waves;electromagnetic field theory;Maxwell equations;quantum theory","Maxwell legacy;displacement current;Maxwell equations;wave phenomena;Maxwell theory;electricity phenomena;magnetism phenomena;Einstein theory;relativity;quantum mechanics;particle physics","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then, given the radio-frequency data, image and signal processing algorithms are designed to extract as much diagnostically relevant information as possible. In this paper, closed-form and low-contrast approximations of ideal observer performance are derived for signal known statistically detection tasks. The accuracy of the approximations are tested by comparing with Monte Carlo techniques. A metric borrowed and modified from photon imaging, Generalized Noise Equivalent Quanta, is shown to be a useful and measurable target-independent figure of merit when adapted for ultrasound systems. This theory provides the potential to optimize design tradeoffs for detection tasks.

Observations of the sun permit corrections to observations of the Earth during the ensuing orbit. Although the instrument was designed to receive uniform sunlight over the entire surface of its detector, the sunlight was in fact not uniform. While this did not adversely affect the calibration, it nonetheless implied a lack of understanding of how the optical system really functioned. To learn what was wrong, NASA used an optical ray-tracing program on a DEC Alpha computer. The results correlated well with the observations made by the instrument itself, but it took nearly two weeks to complete the computer simulation, a discouragingly long time. This paper describes the algorithm and its implementation in a system with multiple digital signal processor (DSP) chips operating in parallel. Timing data show a highly linear relationship between the number of DSPs present and the speed of the computation.

This paper proposes a new perspective of TI processing as an average of a collection of cyclic-basis frame reconstructions, each a stationary signal estimate, contrasting with the nonstationary estimates of orthogonal wavelet thresholding. This viewpoint clarifies that certain characteristics of TI (i.e. reduced edge contour artifacts) are inherited from each cyclic-basis reconstruction, rather than from the process of averaging. We relate performance advantages of TI in smooth areas of images to statistical relationships of the cyclic- basis reconstructions. In edge regions, the quality of cyclic-basis reconstructions varies significantly with pixel position relative to the edge contour. These differences couple with convexity arguments to explain large performance gains of TI in edge regions. They also suggest an improved approach to frame reconstruction, based on estimating relative location information, and identifying the best cyclic-basis reconstruction for the estimated pixel location.","","0-7803-8104","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1291931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291931","","Image denoising;Image reconstruction;Noise reduction;Discrete wavelet transforms;Artificial intelligence;Pixel;Gaussian noise;Mean square error methods;Quantum cascade lasers;Nonlinear filters","image denoising;image reconstruction;wavelet transforms;statistical analysis","translation invariant image denoising;orthogonal wavelet thresholding;image reconstructions;signal estimation;cyclic-basis reconstruction;statistical relationships","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both algorithms were implemented using modified Kaiser-Bessel window functions, also known as blobs, placed on the body-centered cubic (bcc) grid. The algorithms were used to reconstruct a modified 3D Shepp-Logan phantom from data collected for the PI-geometry for two different maximum cone-beam angles (/spl plusmn/9.46/spl deg/ and /spl plusmn/18.43/spl deg/). Both scattering and quantum noise (for three different noise levels) were introduced to create noisy projections. The results presented here (for both noiseless and noisy data sets) point to the fact that, as opposed to filtered backprojection algorithms, the quality of the reconstructions produced by the ART methods does not suffer from the increase in the cone-beam angle.","1530-1834","0-7695-2032","10.1109/SIBGRA.2003.1241031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241031","","Subspace constraints;Image reconstruction;Computed tomography;X-ray detection;X-ray detectors;Noise level;Object detection;Iterative algorithms;X-ray imaging;Sensor arrays","computerised tomography;medical image processing;diagnostic radiography;image scanners;image reconstruction","helical CT reconstruction;cone-beam angle data;algebraic reconstruction technique;ART method;Kaiser-Bessel window function;single ray;cone-beam projection;body-centered cubic grid;3D Shepp-Logan phantom;PI-geometry;quantum noise;filtered backprojection algorithm","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This ensures a simple architecture for the neural network and minimizes the size of the training set required for its proper training. Our studies indicate that features extracted from actual circuits lie closer to each other and exhibit more overlap across fault classes compared to SPICE simulations. This implies that the neural network architecture which can most reliably perform fault diagnosis of actual circuits is one whose outputs estimate the probabilities that input features belong to different fault classes.

Although it is relatively easy to identify the components present in these complexes, it is often difficult to determine their exact stoichiometry and obtain information about the homogeneity of the sample from bulk measurements. We demonstrate the use of single molecule photon-pair correlation spectroscopy to distinguish between discrete numbers of molecules in biological complexes. Fluorescence photon antibunching is observed from a single molecule by employing time-correlated single photon counting in combination with a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss coincidence setup. In addition, pulsed laser excitation and time-tagged time-resolved data collection allow for the measurement of photon arrival times with nanosecond time resolution. The interphoton time distribution between consecutively arriving photons can be calculated and provides a measure of the second-order temporal correlation function. Analysis of this function yields an absolute measure of the number of molecules, N, present in a given complex. It is this ability to measure N that renders this technique powerful for determining stoichiometries in complex biological systems at the single molecule level. We investigate the counting efficiency and statistics of photon antibunching of specifically designed biological samples labeled with multiple copies of the same fluorescent dye and derive conclusions about its use in the analytical evaluation of complex biological samples.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2005.857738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1545989","DNA-protein complexes;Hanbury-Brown and Twiss;photon antibunching;protein complexes;single molecule fluorescence;time-correlated single photon counting","Spectroscopy;DNA;Proteins;Fluorescence;Pulse measurements;Time measurement;Optical pulses;Laser excitation;Nanobioscience;Biological systems","photon correlation spectroscopy;photon counting;dyes;molecular biophysics;DNA;proteins;biological techniques;stoichiometry;biochemistry;photon antibunching;fluorescence","photon-pair correlation spectroscopy;dye molecules;DNA;protein complexes;fluorescence photon antibunching;time-correlated single photon counting;pulsed laser excitation;photon arrival times;stoichiometry","","6","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Neurons that respond to contiguous stimuli produce synchronous oscillations, while those that are not fire independently.

For example, terrain snow consists of ice grains densely packed together, and foam on the ocean surface consists of densely packed air bubbles coated with a thin layer of water. Analytical and numerical methods have been applied to calculate the scattering and emission from such media. The analytical methods include the quasicrystalline approximation (QCA), the quasicrystalline approximation with coherent potential (QCA-CP) and dense media radiative transfer theory (DMRT). On the other hand, the Monte Carlo simulations use an exact numerical formulation based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations of 3D Maxwell's equations. The authors computed the coherent and the incoherent field arising from scattering and absorption in systems of thousands of particles and up to fractional volume of 40%. In the past, they did simulations for small particles and small non-spherical particles. They present Monte Carlo simulations for moderate size particles (ka/spl ges/1). The effect of the scatter placements on the electromagnetic wave is investigated by modeling the adhesive character of the particles that causes them to clump together with a sticky-particle pair distribution function. The adhesive character can provide a more accurate depiction of particles that exist in clusters (for example snow grains, air bubbles in ocean).

Historically, the systematic command and control strategies derived from reductionism and linear principles popularized by Newtonian physics and Cartesian mathematics have directed the field of strategic management. These approaches to strategy formulation and implementation work well for static environments exhibiting little change. The modern competitive environment, constantly changing and increasingly dynamic is anything but static. The new sciences include chaos, complexity and quantum physics. Together, these disciplines expose a world of bounded uncertainty, unpredictable change, self-organization, fractals and complex relationships. More importantly, however, the new sciences are multidisciplinary and have established a new trend in thinking; they base theory and practice on a holistic view of the world. Despite their proliferation since the 1970s, there has been relatively little application of the new sciences in the field of strategic management. This paper develops a strategic management framework based on two of the new sciences-chaos and complexity. The Chaos and Complexity Strategic Management Framework provides generic guidelines for establishing strategic goals, policies and boundaries for operation within a complex and dynamic competitive environment.","","0-7695-0001","10.1109/HICSS.1999.772854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=772854","","Chaos;Environmental management;Physics;Technology management;Ear;Read only memory;Hip;Guidelines;Mathematics;Uncertainty","chaos;computational complexity;strategic planning;management of change;commerce;information technology","technology strategies;complex environment;strategic management;competitive advantage;organizational success;systematic command and control strategies;reductionism;linear principles;Newtonian physics;Cartesian mathematics;strategy formulation;strategy implementation;dynamic environments;constantly changing competitive environment;new sciences;chaos;complexity;quantum physics;bounded uncertainty;unpredictable change;self-organization;fractals;complex relationships;multidisciplinary science;generic guidelines;strategic goals;policies;operational boundaries","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is known that the bulk snow grain size distribution exerts an important control over the microwave response from snow between 3 mm and 300 mm wavelengths. In the absence of high quality snowpack data at a global scale, we show how the grain size distribution can be estimated using a general empirical model of grain growth. This information is used to parameterize a dense media radiative transfer model (DMRT) to estimate the radiometric response from a snow pack as a function of changing grain size distribution. The DMRT equations are based on the quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) for densely distributed moderate sized particles in a medium such as a snow pack. The model snow depth estimates from the DMRT are used to calibrate a Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) snow depth retrieval algorithm which is based on the brightness temperature difference between 19 and 37 GHz with the SWE. The method is tested using meteorological data from the WMO global network. Results show that using the DMRT model coupled with a grain size model improved estimates of snow depth are obtained.","","0-7803-7536","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1025146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025146","","Grain size;Snow;Satellite broadcasting;Water;Earth;Instruments;Size control;Microwave radiometry;Equations;Quantum cellular automata","snow;remote sensing;radiative transfer;radiometry;hydrological techniques","snowpack grain size;global satellite microwave estimates;snow water equivalent;passive microwave data;physical properties;bulk snow grain size distribution;microwave response;grain growth;dense media radiative transfer model;radiometric response;DMRT equations;quasi-crystalline approximation;QCA;densely distributed moderate sized particles;Special Sensor Microwave Imager data;SSM/I;snow depth retrieval algorithm;brightness temperature;19 to 37 GHz","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microwave A/D and D/A converters enable digital RF systems where virtually all information is processed or generated by direct digital means. A complete receiver link can consist of a sensor (e.g. antenna or photodetector), an N-bit A/D converter, and a digital signal processor. A complete transmitter can be built using the appropriate actuator (antenna or laser), an N-bit D/A converter and a digital waveform synthesizer. Future radar, electronic warfare, and communication systems will exploit this all-digital approach to increase the performance and flexibility while lowering the cost. We describe how quantum switching devices can be used to build A/D converters with ultimate sampling rates well above 100 GHz. Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are integrated with heterojunction field effect or bipolar transistors to sample, quantize, encode, demodulate, and filter broadband analog signals. Single-ended and differential circuits are discussed and compared for power consumption, area, and speed. Comparisons are made between RTD/FET and FET-only A/D functions.

The objective of the study was to identify the severity level of bearing defects, where no a priori knowledge on the defect conditions was available.

Thus, maximizing signal output from the fibers is important for achieving the best possible DOI measurement. We have investigated the effects of two design options on the signal output from the WLS fibers: fiber geometry and methods of assembling fibers into a ribbon. A blue-to-green WLS fiber (Saint Gobain BCF-91A) was chosen because its absorption spectrum matches well the emission spectrum of NaI(Tl). Its emissions, peaked at 500 nm, can be detected with reasonable quantum efficiency by enhanced-green-response PMTs.

To maintain system integrity and readiness, there is a need to develop an image quality evaluation system for HMDs. In earlier work, a framework was proposed for an HMD system called the integrated helmet and display sighting system (IHADSS), used with the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter. This paper describes prototype development and interface design and summarizes bench test findings using three IHADSS helmet display units (HDUs). The prototype consists of hardware (cameras, sensors, image capture/data acquisition cards, battery pack, HDU holder, moveable rack and handle, and computer) and software algorithms for image capture and analysis. Two cameras with different-size apertures are mounted in parallel on a rack facing an HDU holder. A handle allows users to position the HDU in front of the two cameras. The HMD test pattern is then captured. Sensors detect the position of the holder and whether the HDU is angled correctly in relation to the camera. Algorithms detect HDU features captured by the two cameras, including focus, orientation, displacement, field-of-view, and number of grayshades. Bench testing of three field-quality HDUs indicates that the image analysis algorithms are robust and able to detect the desired image features. Suggested future directions include development of a learning algorithm to automatically develop or revise feature specifications as the number of inspection samples increases.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2003.820497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246558","","Image quality;Cameras;Testing;Software prototyping;Image analysis;Fires;Helicopters;Prototypes;Computer displays;Hardware","helmet mounted displays;image registration;user interfaces;military avionics;CCD image sensors","helmet-mounted display;image quality evaluation system;pilotage information;fire control information;system integrity;software algorithms;different-size apertures;helmet display units;field-quality display;image analysis algorithms;learning algorithm;integrated helmet display sighting system;focus prediction model","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed algorithm efficiently utilizes the target intensity feature, surrounding background, and shape information for tracking purposes. This algorithm involves the selection of a suitable subframe and a target window based on the intensity and shape of the known reference target. The subframe size is determined from the region of interest and is constrained by target size, target motion, and camera movement. Then, an intensity variation function (IVF) is developed to model the target intensity profile. The IVF model generates the maximum peak value where the reference target intensity variation is similar to the candidate target intensity variation. In the proposed algorithm, a control module has been incorporated to evaluate IVF results and to detect a false alarm (missed target). Upon detecting a false alarm, the controller triggers another algorithm, called template model (TM), which is based on the shape knowledge of the reference target. By evaluating the outputs from the IVF and TM techniques, the tracker determines the real coordinates of one or more targets. The proposed technique also alleviates the detrimental effects of camera motion, by appropriately adjusting the subframe size. Experimental results using real-life long-wave and medium-wave infrared image sequences are shown to validate the robustness of the proposed technique.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.855090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514633","Automatic target tracking (ATT);intensity variation function (IVF);long-wave infrared imagery;medium-wave infrared imagery;template model","Target tracking;Image sequences;In vitro fertilization;Infrared imaging;Object detection;Cameras;Shape control;Infrared detectors;Lighting;Motion estimation","infrared imaging;image sequences;target tracking","automatic target tracking;image sequence;forward-looking infrared;FLIR;intensity variation function;template modeling;ATT algorithm;shape information;IVF;target intensity profile;control module;false alarm;template model;TM technique;camera motion;long-wave infrared imagery;medium-wave infrared imagery","","51","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"HAMMER: hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration","Dinggang Shen; C.

Experimental results demonstrate remarkably high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects, thus enabling very precise localization of morphological characteristics in population studies. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e. a set of geometric moment invariants that is defined on each voxel in an image, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as HAMMER, from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e. suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments in this paper have demonstrated excellent performance.","","0-7695-1336","10.1109/MMBIA.2001.991696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991696","","Anatomy;Biomedical imaging;Image analysis;Radiology;Computer science;Quantum computing;Surgery;Magnetic resonance;Brain;Data mining","brain;image registration;medical image processing;biomedical MRI;mathematical morphology;vectors;image matching;feature extraction","elastic registration;medical images;magnetic resonance images;brain;hierarchical attribute matching mechanism;high accuracy;superposition of images;precise localization;morphological characteristics;attribute vector;geometric moment invariants;suboptimal poor matches;successive approximation;energy function;deformable registration;deformable anatomical models;reduced tissue contrast;average image;warping algorithm;motion artifacts","","7","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the angular distribution of line projections at different observation points within the detector volume are reconstructed. Then, reconstruction techniques are applied to the resulting cone-beam projections to synthesize the 3D source distribution. This paper describes an analytic solution for the first, yet unsolved, task. Building on the convolution theorem in spherical coordinates, a back-projection and inverse filtering technique in terms of spherical harmonics is formulated, The rotation invariance of the point response of the back-projection in spherical coordinates is proved; and the corresponding inverse filter function is derived. The resulting filtered back-projection algorithm then consists of a summation over all detected events of fixed and known event response functions. Measurement errors, which for Compton scatter detectors are typically different for each detected event, can easily be accounted for in the proposed algorithm.

Two magnetic sensors are currently being developed by the Office of Naval Research for buried minehunting (BMH): Polatomic's Laser Scalar Gradiometer (LSG) and Quantum Magnetics' Realtime Tracking Gradiometer (RTG). The LSG is a multi-channel electron-spin resonance scalar magnetometer/gradiometer, while the RTG is a multi-channel tensor gradiometer using fluxgate technology. In this paper, we will describe progress in the development and testing of the LSG. The operation of the LSG is based on the opto-magnetic properties of helium-4 gas in accordance with the Zeeman effect. The LSG and its predecessor, the P-2000, have attained increased sensitivity over comparable sensors by the use of a laser in place of incoherent light for optical pumping. The LSG employs four helium sense cells configured in a volume-filling arrangement to measure four independent channels of information: the scalar field magnitude and admixtures of the three components of the scalar-field gradient vector. The P-2000 electronics consists of a mixture of discrete analog and digital circuits that requires three rack-mounted units. To satisfy the size and power requirements for operation in small UUVs and the requirement for autonomous sensor operation, the LSG electronics features integrated digital surface mount technology. In initial testing, preliminary LSG performance has been measured by acquiring data with the sensor stationary and in motion in a magnetically quiet environment. In addition, a tracking experiment has been conducted to validate algorithms for target detection, classification and localization (DCL). Work is in progress to optimize the performance of the LSG. When this work is completed, the LSG will be integrated into the REMUS 600 developed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and experiments over target fields at sea will be conducted. This paper reviews the LSG design, presents results from the initial land-based testing, and describes plans for system integration and underwater experiments conducted with the LSG onboard REMUS 600.","0197-7385","0-933957-34","10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1640045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640045","","Magnetic sensors;Optical sensors;Sonar detection;Underwater tracking;Magnetic resonance;Sea measurements;Laser fusion;Underwater acoustics;Underwater vehicles;Acoustic signal detection","buried object detection;underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;sensor fusion;magnetometers;magneto-optical sensors","laser scalar gradiometer;buried minehunting;sensor fusion;magnetic sensor;acoustic sensor;optical sensors;unmanned underwater vehicle;realtime tracking gradiometer;electron spin resonance;tensor gradiometer;helium-4 gas;Zeeman effect;P-2000;REMUS 600;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute","","1","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By measuring the pump-induced frequency change on a weak copropagating probe pulse, the optical field ionization dynamics can be completely time-resolved with sub-pulsewidth time resolution. A one-dimensional nonrelativistic electromagnetic fluid code model is used to compute the ionization dynamics and optical field propagation through the plasma. Using the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunnel ionization rate model originally developed for atoms, the relatively simple model proposed here has been shown to compare favorably with the MI-FROG measured ionization rates in noble gases in the intermediate intensity regime (10/sup 14/ W/cm/sup 2/) (Siders et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.). We attempt to unify our studies in noble gases and molecules by performing experiments on N/sub 2/ and O/sub 2/, which have nearly identical ionization potentials to Ar and Xe, respectively. For the molecules studied here, we show that an ADK-like description of molecular ionization rates calculated from the model agree with the experimentally measured rates using the MI-FROG technique for H/sub 2/ and N/sub 2/. In the case of O/sub 2/, however, the experimentally measured ionization rate is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that expected from the standard ADK formula. This is in agreement with the previously observed suppressed O/sub 2/ ionization rate in ion mass spectroscopy studies (Guo, 2000). We attribute the suppressed ionization rate in O/sub 2/ to a multielectron screening effect and show that a modified version of the ADK formula, taking into account the electron screening as proposed by Guo, well approximates the MI-FROG O/sub 2/ ionization rate data.","1077-260X;1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.974229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974229","","Spectroscopy;Ultrafast optics;Ionization;Optical interferometry;Optical pumping;Pulse measurements;Plasma measurements;Frequency measurement;Electromagnetic measurements;Atom optics","photoionisation;hydrogen;nitrogen;oxygen;plasma light propagation;light interferometry;optical pulse generation","coherent ultrafast MI-FROG spectroscopy;optical field ionization;molecular H/sub 2/;molecular N/sub 2/;molecular O/sub 2/;quantitative phase-sensitive measurements;ultrafast optical-field ionization rates;temporally gated frequency-domain interferometric pulse measurement technique;multipulse interferometric frequency-resolved optical gating;MI-FROG;pump-induced frequency change;weak copropagating probe pulse;optical field ionization dynamics;subpulsewidth time resolution;1D nonrelativistic electromagnetic fluid code model;ionization dynamics;optical field propagation;plasma;Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel ionization rate model;MI-FROG measured ionization rates;noble gases;intermediate intensity regime;ionization potentials;ADK-like molecular ionization rates;MI-FROG technique;measured ionization rate;standard ADK formula;suppressed O/sub 2/ ionization rate;ion mass spectroscopy;multielectron screening effect;modified ADK formula;electron screening;MI-FROG O/sub 2/ ionization rate data;diatomic molecules;optical propagation;plasma media;frequency-resolved optical gating;FROG;ultrafast optics;H/sub 2/;O/sub 2/;N/sub 2/;Ar;Xe","","19","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conversely, the spectral content of the terahertz sources provides detailed information about timing jitter and stringent tests of models used to describe the jitter.

Although the fan-out grating pattern is typically thought of as a continuously varying 1-D quasiphase-matched (QPM) structure, the elliptical pump beam illuminates the full 2-D structure of the fan. The phase-matching and gain characteristics of the crystals prefer noncollinear optical parametric generator operation for elliptical pump beams; however, collinear operation was achieved with polished plane- parallel crystal endfaces such that the Fresnel reflections set up a low- finesse monolithic cavity in the crystals themselves. The generated signal and idler beams were spatially chirped in the near field and angularly chirped in the far field while covering spectral bands as large as 1250 cm/sup -1/. With a simple modification, this system also offers an easy way to generate broadband optical frequency combs across the signal and idler spectral bands. We also present theoretical and modeling considerations for large-aperture pumped or flood illuminated 2-D QPM structures. The Fourier transform of the spatial variation in the nonlinear coefficient in a crystal generates a 2-D map of available grating vectors in wave vector mismatch space. This method can be used to glean phase-matching information from complicated 2-D structures that would be difficult to analyze using other methods.","0018-9197;1558-1713","","10.1109/3.929587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929587","","Laser excitation;Nonlinear optics;Optical pumping;Crystals;Gratings;Laser beams;Frequency conversion;Optical frequency conversion;Signal generators;Chirp","lithium compounds;optical phase matching;diffraction gratings;optical parametric oscillators;optical parametric amplifiers;chirp modulation","broadband mid-infrared generation;two-dimensional quasi-phase-matched structures;highly elliptical pump beams;spatially-chirped mid-infrared light;periodically poled lithium niobate;PPLN crystals;fan-out grating period;optical parametric generator configuration;monolithic optical parametric oscillator configuration;Q-switched Nd:YAG laser;continuously varying 1-D quasiphase-matched structure;elliptical pump beam;full 2-D structure;phase-matching;gain characteristics;noncollinear optical parametric generator operation;collinear operation;polished plane- parallel crystal endfaces;Fresnel reflections;low- finesse monolithic cavity;idler beams;signal beams;spatial chirp;near field;angular chirp;far field;spectral bands;broadband optical frequency combs;flood illuminated 2-D QPM structures;large-aperture pumped 2-D QPM structures;Fourier transform;spatial variation;nonlinear coefficient;grating vectors;wave vector mismatch space;25.5 to 31.2 mum;15 mm;LiNbO/sub 3/;YAG:Nd;YAl5O12:Nd","","33","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Until now, studies conducted for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) assume that the network nodes are initially fully charged with the available battery power and are not recharged thereafter. With the aid of extensive simulation studies conducted in ns-2 on standard routing protocols like CMMBCR, AODV, DSR and ABR, we show that given a fixed energy budget, on-demand recharging can improve the network lifetime by a factor of 1.5 to 3.

A sufficient condition is given to determine if a configuration of accelerometers is feasible. If the condition is satisfied, the angular and linear motions can be computed separately using two decoupled equations of an input-output dynamical system: a state equation for angular velocity and an output equation for linear acceleration.

When the NavMote comes within range of a sensor network (composed of NetMotes), it downloads the compressed data to the network. The network relays the data via a RelayMote to an information center where the data are processed into an estimate of the pedestrian trajectory based on a dead reckoning algorithm. System details including the NavMote hardware/software, sensor network middleware services, and the dead reckoning algorithm are provided. In particular, simple but effective step detection and step length estimation methods are implemented in order to reduce computation, memory, and communication requirements on the Motes. Static and dynamic calibrations of the compass data are crucial to compensate the heading errors. The dead reckoning performance is further enhanced by wireless telemetry and map matching. Extensive testing results show that satisfactory tracking performance with relatively long operational time is achieved. The paper also serves as a brief survey on pedestrian navigation systems, sensors, and techniques.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.858557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542534","Dead reckoning;pedestrian navigation system;wireless sensor network","Dead reckoning;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks;Magnetic sensors;Relays;Magnetic cores;Accelerometers;Hardware;Middleware;Software algorithms","inertial navigation;mobile radio;wireless sensor networks;radiotelemetry","wireless assisted pedestrian dead reckoning system;inertial sensing;wireless sensor network;NavMote;integrated magnetic compass;accelerometers;step detection;step length estimation;static calibrations;dynamic calibrations;wireless telemetry;map matching;pedestrian navigation system;heading errors","","149","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to evaluate the accuracy of this technique, the authors have developed a technique for embedding realistic simulated moving stenotic arteries in real clinical coronary angiograms. They evaluate the accuracy of layer decomposition in two ways. First, they compute tracking errors as the distance between the true and estimated motion of a reference point in the arterial lesion. The authors find that noise-weighted phase correlation and layered background subtraction are superior to cross correlation and fixed mask subtraction, respectively. Second, they compute the correlation coefficient between the true vessel profile and the raw and processed images in the region of the stenosis.

Reliability and data integrity are the commonly emphasized requirements of spaceborne solid-state mass storage systems, because faults due to the harsh cosmic environments, such as extreme radiation, can be experienced throughout the mission. Acceptable dependability for these instruments has been achieved by using redundancy and repair. Reconfiguration (repair) of memory arrays using spare memory lines is the most common technique for reliability enhancement of memories with faults. Faulty cells in memory arrays are known to show spatial locality. This physical phenomenon is referred to as fault clustering . This paper initially investigates a quadrat-based fault model for memory arrays under clustered faults to establish a reliable foundation of measurement. Then, lifelong dependability of a fault-tolerant spaceborne memory system with hierarchical active redundancy, which consists of spare columns in each memory module and redundant memory modules, is measured in terms of the reliability (i.e., the conditional probability that the system performs correctly throughout the mission) and mean-time-to-failure (i.e., the expected time that a system will operate before it fails). Finally, minimal column redundancy search technique for the fault-tolerant memory system is proposed and verified through a series of parametric simulations. Thereby, design and fabrication of cost-effective and highly reliable fault-tolerant onboard mass storage system can be realized for dependable instrumentation.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.858514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542529","Clustered faults;hierarchical active redundancy;mean-time-to-failure (MTTF);memory reconfiguration (repair);onboard mass storage system;quadrat-based fault model;redundancy minimization;reliability","Instruments;Circuit faults;Redundancy;Solid state circuits;Fault tolerant systems;Single event transient;Lattices;Semiconductor device modeling;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Single event upset","aerospace instrumentation;storage management chips;data integrity;redundancy;fault tolerant computing","reliability measurement;mass storage system;onboard instrumentation;spaceborne vehicular technology;data integrity;fault clustering;memory array reconfiguration;mean time to failure;harsh cosmic environments;spare memory lines;faulty cells;quadrat-based fault model;fault-tolerant spaceborne memory system;hierarchical active redundancy;redundancy minimization","","3","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Experimental coatings and treatments to improve the function of an implant can now be evaluated in situ and in real-time for improved blood vessel growth (angiogenesis), reduced inflammation, and reduction of foreign body encapsulation. A tissue site can be viewed, recorded, and evaluated for a continuous time period without surgical intervention, thereby saving animal lives. The implantable system comprises a miniaturized fiber optic lens-based CCD camera, a TV video transmitter, a 4-LED illumination module, and a 9 VDC battery source. The TV video signal is telemetried out to a TV set or video tape recorder having a tuner. The 512/spl times/492 display or printout image pixels represent a 1.6/spl times/1.2 mm field of view by virtue of a 1:3 tapered (3X optical magnification) lens. The apparent magnification thus can approach 200 power with a 200 /spl mu/m resolution (4 /spl mu/m Nyquist).

Yield enhancement of conventional memory systems relies on additional redundancy, but FPGA reconfigurable memory systems have inherited redundancy and customizability. Thus, they can accommodate numerous target memory configurations, and redundant memory cells, if any, can be used as spares to enhance the dynamic yield of a target memory configuration. Three fundamental strategies are introduced and analyzed; i.e., redundant bit utilization, redundant word utilization, and a combination of both. Mathematical analysis of those techniques also has been conducted to study their effects on the yield. Selecting the most yield enhancing logical memory configuration which can accommodate a target memory requirement among the candidate configurations is referred to as optimal fitting.

Wei; Chunming Qiao","Quantum Bridge Commun., Andover, MA, USA; NA; NA","Journal of Lightwave Technology","","2000","18","12","1917","1927","As wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology matures and multicast applications become increasingly popular, supporting multicast at the WDM layer becomes an important and yet challenging topic. In this paper, we study constrained multicast routing in WDM networks with sparse light splitting, i.e., where some switches are incapable of splitting light (of copying data in the optical domain) due to evolutional and/or economical reasons. Specifically, we propose four WDM multicast routing algorithms, namely, re-route-to-source, re-route-to-any, member-first, and member-only. Given the network topology, multicast membership information, and light splitting capability of the switches, these algorithms construct a source-based multicast ""light-forest"" (consisting one or more multicast trees) for each multicast session. While the first two algorithms can build on a multicast tree constructed by IP (which does not take into consideration the splitting capability of the WDM switches), the last two algorithms attempt to address the joint problem of optimal multicast routing and sparse splitting in WDM networks. The performance of these algorithms are compared in terms of the average number of wavelengths used per forest (or multicast session), average number of branches involved (bandwidth) per forest as well as average number of hops encountered (delay) from a multicast source to a multicast member. The results obtained from this research should present new and exciting opportunities for further theoretical as well as experimental work.","0733-8724;1558-2213","","10.1109/50.908787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908787","","Routing;Intelligent networks;WDM networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;Multicast algorithms;Multicast protocols;IP networks;Optical fiber networks;Bandwidth;Optical switches","wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre networks;Internet;telecommunication network routing;optical beam splitters","constrained multicast routing;WDM networks;sparse light splitting;WDM;multicast applications;WDM layer;multicast routing;splitting light;optical domain;WDM multicast routing algorithms;re-route-to-source;re-route-to-any algorithms;member-first algorithms;member-only routing algorithms;multicast tree;splitting capability;multicast member","","126","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Efficient testing schemes for single-port memories have been readily available. Multiport memories are widely used in multiprocessor systems, telecommunication application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc. Research papers which define multiport memory fault models and give march tests for the same are currently available. However, little work has been done to use the power of serial interfacing for testing multiport memories. In this paper, we develop a powerful test architecture for two-port memories using the serial interfacing technique. Based on the serial testing mechanism, we propose new march algorithms which can prove effective to reduce hardware cost considerably for a chip with many two-port memories. Once we understand how serial interfacing helps test two-port memories, one possible extension is to use serial interfacing for p-port memories (p > 2).

Elimination of noise and extraction of peak amplitude are important signal processing tasks associated with the analysis of EMAT signals. This paper presents a method of noise elimination and information extraction for pulsed sinusoids. The functionality of the proposed method is exemplified through noise reduction and peak detection of EMAT signals.

This paper reports new space compression techniques which facilitate designing such circuits using compact test sets, with the primary objective of minimizing the storage requirements for the circuit under test (CUT) while maintaining the fault coverage information. The compaction techniques utilize the concepts of Hamming distance, sequence weights, and derived sequences in conjunction with the probabilities of error occurrence in the selection of specific gates for merger of a pair of output bit streams from the CUT. The outputs of the space compactor may eventually be fed into a time compactor (viz. syndrome counter) to derive the CUT signatures. The proposed techniques guarantee simple design with a very high fault coverage for single stuck-line faults, with low CPU simulation time, and acceptable area overhead. Design algorithms are proposed in the paper, and the simplicity and ease of their implementations are demonstrated with numerous examples.

Since ordering depends on the surface properties during organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE), the ability to control the surface has been shown to be important for controlling ordering and for producing heterostructures and quantum wells. However, perhaps equally as important as the affect of ordering on the bandgap is the fundamental information that it can provide about the surface during growth. We report on the use of time dependent surface photoabsorption (SPA) measurements to determine the rate of change in the P dimer concentration when triethylantimony (TESb) is added to and removed from the reactor. In particular, the time constants for the transients are presented and compared with the Langmuir model for adsorption and desorption of the surfactant.

Brodowicz","California Inst. of Technol., USA; NA","Innovative Architecture for Future Generation High-Performance Processors and Systems (IWIA'05)","","2005","","","9 pp.","","Continuum computer architecture (CCA) is a non-von Neumann architecture that offers an alternative to conventional structures as digital technology evolves towards nano-scale and the ultimate flat-lining of Moore's law. Coincidentally, it also defines a model of architecture particularly well suited to logic classes that exhibit ultra-high clock rates (> 100 GHz) such as rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) gates. CCA eliminates the concept of the ""CPU"" that has dominated computer architecture since its inception more than half a century ago and establishes a new local element that merges the properties of state storage, state transfer, and state operation. A CCA system architecture is a simple multidimensional organization of these elemental blocks and physically may be considered as a new family of cellular computer. But CCA differs dramatically from conventional cellular automata. While both deliver emergent global behavior from the aggregation of local rules and ensuing operation. The CCA emergent behavior is a global general-purpose model of parallel computation, as opposed to simply mimicking some limited phenomenon like heat and mass transfer as do conventional cellular automata. This paper presents the motivation and foundation concepts of CCA and exposes key issues for further work.","1537-3223","0-7695-2483","10.1109/IWIA.2005.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587831","","Computer architecture;Clocks;Nanoscale devices;CMOS technology;Logic devices;Concurrent computing;Delay;Signal processing;Moore's Law;Multidimensional systems","nanotechnology;computer architecture","continuum computer architecture;nanoscale clock rate;ultra-high clock rate;nonvon Neumann architecture;Moore law;parallel computation","","2","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a new space compaction approach that only uses information about the fault-free responses for a precomputed test set T. It is, therefore, especially suitable for embedded cores. It does not make any assumption about an underlying fault model, and it does not make use of any structural information about the core. Advantages of this approach include complete error propagation for all errors and optimum (provably maximum) compaction ratio. Classical linear space compactors often require structural information and can only guarantee error propagation for a specific fault model. In contrast, the proposed compactor design is based on the use of orthogonal transmission functions, which allow all errors produced by T to be propagated through the space compactor. We illustrate the proposed method by presenting case studies on compactor synthesis for several large ISCAS benchmark circuits.

For example, it is possible to reach a resolution of about a few percent of flux quantum by using a single-shot measurement that takes only a few picoseconds. All these SFQ circuits produce during each clock period only one bit of information that indicates whether the applied flux is larger or smaller the threshold. As a result it is natural to call them digital (or logic) SQUIDs. The new sensors can be used to detect a direction of the electrical current induced in a superconductor loop by the external field and digitally compensated by another SFQ devices. This composite device contains two kinds of digital components and also could be called a Digital SQUID. It has a limited practical value with a hundreds MHz clock rate. Fortunately, the clock frequency could be increased to tens of GHz. But in this case the third digital device (a decimation filter) should be added to filter out off-band noise and reduce the output clock frequency. The last device is rather similar to an ADC and also could be called a Digital SQUID. It is easy to show that the last Digital SQUID has a practically unlimited slew rate and dynamic range without suffering significant loss of energy sensitivity of the conventional two-junction SQUID.","1051-8223;1558-2515;2378-7074","","10.1109/TASC.2003.814027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211711","","SQUIDs;Clocks;Current measurement;Superconducting logic circuits;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Digital filters;Magnetic field measurement;Force measurement;Logic devices","SQUIDs;superconducting logic circuits","digital SQUID;SFQ circuit;logic SQUID;ADC comparator;slew rate;superconductor digital circuit;decimation filter;dynamic range;energy sensitivity;time resolution","","14","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The conventional algorithms used for time measurement of periodic signals (e.g., period, positive and negative duty cycles and pulse widths) are based on crossings of a reference level. The crossings method for time measurement fails when there are spurious crossings around the reference level. We have developed a robust and accurate algorithm for time measurement of period, duty cycle, and pulse width, based on correlation techniques. The algorithm for determining the period is generic to any periodic waveform with at least one period. The algorithm for duty cycles and pulse widths is only valid for pulse-shaped waveforms. Using example waveforms, our algorithm is shown to produce more robust and accurate time measurements than the built-in algorithm used in a commercial oscilloscope.

One cause of long measurement times is the difficulty of deciding a priori how many bits to measure to establish the BER to within a predetermined confidence interval width. This paper explores a new approach to deciding how many bits to measure, namely a sequential Bayesian approach. As measurement proceeds, the posterior distribution of BER is checked to see if the conclusion can be made that the BER rate is known to be within the desired range with high enough probability. Desired properties of the posterior distribution such as the maximum a postiori estimate and confidence limits can be computed quickly using off-the-shelf numerical software.

This paper introduces the stimulus error identification and removal (SEIR) method for accurately testing ADC linearity using signal generators that may be significantly less linear than the device under test. In the SEIR approach, two imprecise nonlinear but functionally related excitations are applied to the ADC input to obtain two sets of ADC output data. The SEIR algorithm then uses the redundant information from the two sets of data to accurately identify the nonlinearity errors in the stimuli. The algorithm then removes the stimulus error from the ADC output data, allowing the ADC nonlinearity to be accurately measured. For a high resolution ADC, the total computation time of the SEIR algorithm is significantly less than the data acquisition time and therefore does not contribute to testing time. The new approach was experimentally validated on production test hardware with a commercial 16-bit successive approximation ADC. Integral nonlinearity test results that are well within the device specification of /spl plusmn/2 least significant bits were obtained by using 7-bit linear input signals. This approach provides an enabling technology for cost-effective full-code testing of high precision ADCs in production test and for potential cost-effective chip-level implementation of a built-in self-test capability.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.847240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433194","Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs);integral nonlinearity (INL);linearity test;stimulus error identification and removal (SEIR)","Analog-digital conversion;Linearity;Signal processing;Production;Circuit testing;Signal resolution;Signal generators;Automatic testing;Computer industry;Industrial control","analogue-digital conversion;integrated circuit testing;signal generators;error detection","analog-to-digital converter testing;ADC;low linearity signals;stimulus error identification;error removal;linearity testing;signal generator;16 bit;7 bit","","88","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper analyzes some inconsistency of earlier results and identifies its source as a deviation of nonstatistical nature caused by round-off errors. This information enables us to greatly improve the statistical basis of the electron g-2 value to very high statistics while minimizing the uncertainty of the nonstatistical type.

In this paper, a new version of the direct current (dc) electromagnetic induction system is introduced in which a sensor system, based on the dc electromagnetic induction instrument, is coupled with an updated data acquisition system. Unlike the conventional dc induction instrument, the new system can achieve a full-signature logging response by providing all the measured flux leakage (FL) signals and eddy current (EC) signals to the computer logging system (CLS) on the surface. To transmit the information represented by large amounts of data acquired by downhole instruments to the CLS on the surface, a wavelet data compression technique has been incorporated. A VLSI integrated circuit (IC) which realizes the wavelet transform has been designed so that the real-time mode can be achieved during the logging operation. The circuit has been designed using CMOS n-well 2-/spl mu/m technology and has been fabricated by MOSIS.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/19.836321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836321","","Corrosion;Instruments;Electromagnetic induction;CMOS technology;Monitoring;Petroleum industry;Steel;Production;Protection;Sensor systems","inspection;corrosion testing;eddy current testing;oil technology;natural gas technology;computerised monitoring;data loggers;data acquisition;data compression;VLSI;signal processing equipment;digital signal processing chips;wavelet transforms","underground casing pipes;real-time corrosion detection;corrosion monitoring;early detection of pits;wall thinning;DC electromagnetic induction system;updated data acquisition system;full-signature logging response;flux leakage signals;eddy current signals;computer logging system;downhole instruments;wavelet data compression;VLSI integrated circuit;CMOS technology;MOSIS fabrication;Fourier transforms;ASIC design;cased-hole inspection;ADC;signal conditioning;microprocessor controlled circuit;high logging speed","","9","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Steel reinforcing bars embedded in good quality concrete are normally protected from corrosion. However, the presence of a sufficient concentration of free chloride ions in the region of the reinforcing steel can initiate the process of corrosion. Therefore, it is important to be able to detect ingress of chloride ions and their distribution in cement-based materials. Moreover, it is important to obtain this information nondestructively. In recent years, near-field microwave nondestructive evaluation methods, using open-ended rectangular waveguide probes, have proven effective for evaluating many important properties of cement-based materials, including the detection of salt, added to the mixing water and when entering these materials through exposure to salt solution. Additionally, successful electromagnetic modeling of the interaction of microwave signals with moist cement-based materials has provided the necessary insight for evaluating the distribution and movement of moisture within these materials, leading to the current study involving ingress of sodium chloride solution. To this end, a mortar cube was subjected to cycles of wetting in a sodium chloride bath with a salinity of 2.8%, followed by episodes of drying. Subsequently, the microwave reflection properties of the cube were measured at 3 and 10 GHz using open-ended rectangular waveguides for several cycles, each lasting about 35 days. A semiempirical electromagnetic model, representing the cube as a stratified structure with a nonuniform dielectric property profile, was then developed to simulate the measured reflection properties. The simulated and the measured results at both frequencies and for all cycles were in good agreement. Subsequently, the effect of ingress of salt solution in terms of the temporal distribution of moisture along with the dissolved salt (i.e., pore solution) within the cube for every cycle was also estimated. This paper presents a brief description of the measurement approach and a detailed description of the model and its results.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.853221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514662","Chloride;concrete;corrosion;microwaves;nondestructive testing","Electromagnetic reflection;Mortar;Electromagnetic modeling;Building materials;Dielectric measurements;Electromagnetic measurements;Concrete;Steel;Corrosion;Electromagnetic waveguides","mortar;nondestructive testing;microwave reflectometry;concrete","microwave reflection properties;cyclically soaked mortar;semiempirical electromagnetic model;chloride ingress detection;reinforced concrete structures;steel reinforcing bars;corrosion;cement-based materials;microwave nondestructive evaluation;rectangular waveguide probes;moisture distribution;nondestructive testing;3 GHz;10 GHz;35 days","","7","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is of particular interest if light scattering is used for medical diagnostics of biological cells. The intricate relationship between scattered light and cellular morphological structure is especially visible over the whole scattering regime. Unfortunately, intensity levels of the scattered light display large variations over scattering angles. Consequently, low and high angles of scattering cannot be concomitantly imaged in one single test. Repeated measurements over a series of angles are time consuming and inefficient. On the other hand, preferential sampling of only a few scattering angles results in overlooking important information contained in other angular ranges. We propose the use of an interference filter for selective attenuation of scattered light. Our approach is to employ a commercial shortwave-pass filter. We discuss how to obtain adequate contrast between scattering peaks to enable detection over a wide angular range. The filter is incorporated into the design of a microchip-based optical device for single cell medical diagnostics. It is expected that this inexpensive device will provide advantages arising from simultaneous imaging of a wider angular range.","0018-9456;1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2005.853675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514668","Interference;light scattering;medical diagnostics;shortwave-pass filter","Filtering;Light scattering;Optical scattering;Optical filters;Medical diagnosis;Biological cells;Displays;Testing;Time measurement;Image sampling","patient diagnosis;cellular biophysics;interference filters;light scattering;micro-optics","scattered light filtering;microchip-based cell diagnostics;light scattering;medical diagnostics;biological cells;cellular morphological structure;interference filter;selective attenuation;shortwave-pass filter;microchip-based optical device","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
