J.P. Morgan Chase & Co said on Monday it had appointed Mark Leung as the chief executive of its China business. A veteran who's been with the bank for 21 years, Leung will manage onshore and offshore activities in the country. He started his career in rates derivatives trading and has held trading roles in emerging Markets, credit hybrids and equity derivatives. Additionally, JPMorgan announced it had submitted an application to the Chinese securities regulator for setting up a new onshore securities business in which the U.S. bank would own a 51 percent stake. It's also looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, the bank said. The bank's asset and wealth management unit is working on increasing its current joint venture stake to a majority interest, subject to an agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities, it said in a statement. The submission of the application to the regulator marks a step towards JPMorgan's return to China securities business after 2016 when it sold its 33 percent holding in a similar venture to its local partner. \u2014 Reuters contributed reporting.

Walmart said on Saturday in a filing with a U.S. regulator that it may take India's Flipkart public in as early as four years, detailing for the first time a potential listing timeline for Walmart's largest-ever acquisition. Minority investors holding 60 percent of Flipkart's shares \"acting together, may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering\" (IPO) four years after the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in a May 11 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian e-commerce firm, the filing said. Walmart announced earlier this week that it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart in what is the U.S. retail giant's largest-ever deal and a move to take on arch rival Amazon in a key growth market. The investment implies a valuation of nearly $21 billion for Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart. Minority shareholders after the deal include co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings, U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management and Microsoft. The deal now awaits clearance from India's anti-trust regulator and is expected to close later this year. show chapters What is Flipkart? 8:01 PM ET Wed, 4 April 2018 | 00:56 As part of the deal, Walmart will initially appoint five directors to Flipkart's board, two directors will be named by minority shareholders while Bansal will take one board seat, according to the filing. Walmart said it may, in future, appoint a sixth board member with the approval of the majority of the Flipkart directors. It also said it could appoint or replace Flipkart's chief executive and other key executives of group companies in consultation with Bansal and the board. Walmart or its units could ask Flipkart to issue new ordinary shares of up to $3 billion before the close of the \"transactions and on or before the first anniversary of the closing\", it said. Reuters previously reported that Google-parent Alphabet was in talks to invest about $3 billion for a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart. That deal could be sealed before the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction or immediately after, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the talks are private. Walmart also said no party would be liable to pay a termination fee if a share issuance or purchase agreement with Flipkart were terminated. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Japan's SoftBank Group, which owns a roughly 20 percent stake in Flipkart, was rethinking its exit due to tax liabilities and because it saw further value in Flipkart. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said that their investment in Flipkart had grown to almost $4 billion. That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart. A spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment. Former Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.

Shares of NXP Semiconductors jumped about 12 percent Monday on a report that Chinese regulators will restart a review of Qualcomm's takeover bid for the company. Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that China's Ministry of Commerce has been asked to hasten the deal's review as well as Qualcomm's plans to protect local companies. Qualcomm's share price gained 2.5 percent on the report. Qualcomm is proposing to buy NXP for $127.50 a share, or $44 billion. The deal has received approval from eight of nine global regulators. Chinese regulators have said the deal could hurt competition within the chipmaker sector. The new report is another indication that U.S.-China trade relations appear to be thawing. On Sunday, President Donald Trump said he would help Chinese cellphone maker ZTE \"get back into business, fast.\" This comes after the U.S. imposed a ban on exports from U.S. companies to ZTE earlier this year. In a tweet, the president said: \"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\" Tweet A spokesperson for NXP told CNBC in an email that the company \"has a policy to not comment on rumors, speculation or ongoing regulatory matters.\" Qualcomm did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Warring creditor groups in Puerto Rico's ongoing debt restructuring have reached an agreement that could resolve one of the most contentious disputes in the more than $70 billion bankruptcy case. A proposed settlement would provide approximately $10 billion of debt relief and would resolve substantial risks to the Commonwealth, according to the executive summary. It would also end a more than yearlong court battle between two top tier creditor groups, which have been fighting over who has first rights to the island's sales-tax revenue for bond payments. Those groups are the owners of general obligation bonds and owners of bonds issued by Cofina, which are supported by sales tax revenue. The groups announced the plan in separate statements on Monday. The two have agreed to set up a trust that would take in Puerto Rico's 5.5 percent sales and use tax for 40 years and then pay out to the separate bondholder groups, Mark Palmer, a BTIG analyst who covers bond insurers, wrote in a note on Monday. \"The trust would then make an exchange offer for all GO bonds and allowed general unsecured claims (GUCs),\" the note said. Cofina bondholders would receive 52.5 percent of the sales tax revenue, while general obligation bondholders would get 46.2 percent. \"The supporting parties have come together for the first time in years to forge an agreement on a settlement framework that provides for a consensual path to a successful restructuring. The settlement framework reached by this diverse group of stakeholders would significantly decrease the duration and cost of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, while also providing for substantial deleveraging,\" the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders said in a statement. Other supporting parties in the settlement are the Bonistas del Patio, which represents island residents who own bonds, and the bond insurers Assured Guaranty, Ambac and MBIA. In total, the supporting parties hold more than $11 billion of Puerto Rico's debt. Cofina's bondholders would share $12.1 billion, which amounts to recoveries of 93 percent to 95 percent for the senior bondholders and 42.2 percent to 43.2 percent for the subordinate bondholders, or about 64 percent combined. General obligation bondholders would get $10.7 billion, a recovery for them of 58.6 percent. Sources familiar with the matter told CNBC that the general obligation creditors would be able to pursue additional claims from the Commonwealth for the amount not covered by the payments from the trust. The government of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico's Financial Oversight and Management Board were not part of the talks, and both parties rejected the terms. The seven-member Oversight Board, which oversees the beleaguered island's finances, said the economic terms of the creditor proposal did not align with the fiscal plan it certified on April 19, calling it \"completely unaffordable\". \"In the Board's view, the proposed terms would create large and recurring structural deficits over the long-run as compared to the long-term primary surpluses projected in the certified New Fiscal Plan, which are highly dependent on the Government's full implementation of said Fiscal Plan, with no aspect as critical to long-term economic growth as prompt enactment of the proposed labor reform,\" the Board said in a written statement. The Cofina Coalition, made up of those who hold approximately $4 billion of senior and subordinate Cofina bonds, supports the proposed settlement but said it also believes that there are other avenues for an agreement to be reached. \"While members of the Coalition support the COFINA-GO settlement framework, the group also proposed alternative settlement terms \u2013 again with significant principal haircuts to COFINA \u2013 in mid-April to other constituencies that include the Commonwealth Agent and the Official Committee of Retirees,\" a written statement from the Coalition said.

Cryptocurrency conferences are still a massive business, even if bitcoin's price has plunged this year. When it kicks off this week, one ticket to CoinDesk's Consensus three-day conference in New York City can cost roughly $2,000. Well over 4,000 are expected to attend, up from 2,700 attendees last year. So at a minimum, the conference is likely bringing in $8 million. More than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are also scheduled during the days around Consensus. The bitcoin conference that began with 400 attendees three years ago is now the centerpiece of a full-blown \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Consensus conference attendance growth over the years Source: CoinDesk Last year's conferences helped drive the surge of attention on cryptocurrencies. Around Consensus 2017 last May, Bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000, and was bolstered by the first TokenSummit and Ethereal Summit. Prices then skyrocketed over the rest of the year, drawing Wall Street's interest and topping $10,000 for the first time after the \"Consensus Invest\" conference in November. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since topping $19,000 in December, but it remains more than 4 times above where it was last May. This year's speaker lineup also reflects significant inroads made by the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, whose mobile payments company Square launched bitcoin trading this year, is set to speak at Consensus on Wednesday. Other conference panelists range from government officials to start-up leaders. Consensus \"does have a reputation of, if you speak at that event you're on the map,\" said Michael Oved, co-founder of a token marketplace called AirSwap, and organizer of a blockchain conference called Fluidity, which took place Thursday. He said he purposely under-priced his conference \u2013 tickets ran from $150 to $250 \u2013 because he saw it as \"an opportunity for us to talk about the things we've been working on.\" About 700 people attended the Brooklyn event, Oved said. That would bring ticket sales to about $140,000. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month.\" -Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Other events charge at least several hundred dollars for admission, including: The two-day Ethereal Summit run by ConsenSys sells tickets for $1,300 each; TokenSummit on May 17 is sold out of regular $649 tickets, and a \"very late ticket\" costs $979; The \"Women on the Block\" conference held on Mother's Day charges $299 for general admission, and $599 for VIP access to a reception and a lounge. Childcare for children ages 5 to 11 costs $80; General admission to the May 18 NYC Blockchain Tech & Invest Summit is $899, while investors and VIP tickets are $1,299, according to Eventbrite. The ADI Cryptocurrency Mining Summit charges $499 to $699. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month,\" said Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, which runs a mobile-based cryptocurrency storage app. \"This represents an opportunity for companies that are trying to jump on that bandwagon to take advantage of that confluence of factors at the same time,\" he said. \"Obviously there's a lot of money moving around in terms of sponsorships. We're getting requests every day to sponsor.\" Getty Images Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin However, not everyone in the cryptocurrency world is happy about the massive conference industry. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted on April 26 that he is boycotting Consensus this year partly because of the high ticket price. \"The conference costs $2-$3k to attend. I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent seeking,\" Buterin said. He added that CoinDesk \"is recklessly complicit in enabling giveaway scams,\" and called their coverage of an ethereum split \"highly sensationalist.\" Tweet In a statement, CoinDesk responded that it was \"disappointed to learn of Vitalik's tweet today regarding a CoinDesk reporting error, for which we apologize. One of our reporters included an unverified link in an article; we quickly identified the error and fixed it. We strive to maintain the highest level of unbiased, ethical journalism in order to provide the best possible coverage of the blockchain industry.\" Amber Baldet, former head of blockchain at J.P. Morgan, also criticized the increasingly costly cryptocurrency events. \"The irony of high-priced conferences is they're the ones least likely to be paying speakers within the community, who care the most & need the platform to share new work,\" she tweeted on April 28. \"Corporate expense accounts subsidize people who rarely say anything novel, 'celeb keynotes' extract high fees.\" She is a speaker at two of the primary events of the week, Ethereal Summit and Consensus. \"I'm not getting paid for either,\" she said in another tweet, adding that their livestreams \"are a great way to democratize access.\" 'So many conferences...it's crazy' With all the hype and partying that conferences bring, it's also unclear whether they ultimately help start-ups progress along a planned production schedule \u2014 especially when many can struggle under inexperienced management. \"There are so many conferences now,\" Oved said. \"It's crazy.

The nation's largest banks \u2014 and public companies, for that matter \u2014 are preparing for a timeout from the courtroom following years of being pummeled by shareholder and investor lawsuits in the wake of the Great Recession. At the end of 2017, the country's largest banks collectively decreased their estimates for future legal costs to their lowest levels since 2012, and legal experts predict the move is a harbinger of what's to come for Corporate America in an era of strong job growth and loosening regulations at the federal level. Between 2012 and the end of 2017, the nation's 10 biggest banks by assets saw a 56 percent decline in their anticipated litigation expenses beyond their required cash reserves, according to financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The estimates signify the amounts banks expect to pay in litigation and legal costs beyond what they are required to set aside as emergency legal funds. The estimates are published each quarter with the SEC. More from The American City Business Journals: Tesla loses top safety executive to rival Waymo Intel reassigns marketing chief In the money May 14: Nearly $15M raised by Austin startups fighting cancer and simplifying road toll payments Leading the way was Regions Financial Corp., which saw a 100 percent reduction in its anticipated legal costs in excess of reserves over the past five years, indicating the bank isn't expecting any major settlements in the coming months. Regions did not respond to requests for comment on its legal position. Likewise, Citigroup reduced its estimate by 80 percent while both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and PNC Financial Services Group both lowered their estimates by more than 70 percent. LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL The downturn in litigation is not limited to the banking sector, said Dennis Tracey, chair of Hogan Lovells' litigation practice in New York. Recent U.S. Supreme Court cases tightening personal jurisdiction rules have made it much harder to file suit against a company outside of the state where it is domiciled or has its principle place of business. Tracy said that has helped to limit the number of lawsuits across all industries. Another plus for corporations: The Supreme Court recently handed down decisions reining in intellectual property cases and making it harder for so-called patent trolls to advance legal claims. Tracey also pointed to the election of President Donald Trump, whose administration has made it a priority to loosen the regulatory climate for corporations. \"There has really been a decline in litigation since the financial crisis, when many companies began to rethink their legal spending,\" Tracey said. \"I don't know if it's permanent or temporary.\" Which is not to say companies were without significant legal costs in 2017. Wells Fargo topped all U.S. companies with some $2.1 billion in after-tax legal and settlement costs, followed by Alphabet at $1.8 billion and drug maker Johnson & Johnson at $955 million, according to regulatory filings. CALM AFTER THE STORM Tracey said the reductions in bank-litigation costs are partly due to the fact that many lawsuits filed in the wake of the financial crisis are winding down. Banks were in many cases required to pay multimillion-dollar \u2014 even multibillion-dollar \u2014 settlements to resolve a wave of litigation stemming from last decade's financial and housing crises. \"The financial crisis spawned a huge amount of very high stakes litigation and regulatory actions,\" Tracey said. \"There are some remaining large matters, but among our clients that happen to be large banks, most believe the worst is behind them.\" Wells Fargo is one major exception. The banking giant has faced a raft of lawsuits in recent years, with claims ranging from allegations over unauthorized accounts to discriminatory mortgage practices to fraud affecting retail clients. Regulatory filings highlight the company's legal challenges, as Wells Fargo increased its estimate for litigation costs in excess of reserves to $2.7 billion in 2017's fourth quarter, roughly double where it was in 2012. Wells Fargo is a Hogan Lovells client. Tracey said a strong economy also is contributing to the decline in legal challenges for banks, as low unemployment and rising wages have sapped some of the motivation that's driven prior shareholder lawsuits.

Chipotle Mexican Grill's recovery efforts, including the appointment of a new chief executive and a new delivery partnership, represent steps in the right direction, according to Piper Jaffray. The firm reiterated its overweight rating on the restaurant company's shares, predicting Chipotle's stock price could top $530 in 12 months, the highest target on Wall Street and implying 25 percent upside from Friday's close. Piper's previous target was $420. \"Chipotle shares remain a top recovery pick. When, and as (not \"if\") the recovery unfolds, meaningful leverage exists,\" analyst Nicole Regan said in a note Sunday. \"Our positive bias is based on culture change, strong unit-level economics and solid balance sheet. Catalysts include operational excellence, brand remodeling, and capital deployment.\" The appointment of Brian Niccol as chief executive officer \u2014 who arrived with a successful track record at Taco Bell \u2014 as well as a new delivery partnership with DoorDash have supported the stock and sales, Regan said, and justify same-store sales expectations in excess of 2 percent. Shares of Chipotle rose 0.7 percent in premarket trading following Piper Jaffray's optimistic call. The shares are up 47 percent this year. While Niccol built a reputation for menu innovation at Taco Bell, he recently told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that while investors shouldn't expect major changes to the company's offerings, items like breakfast burritos aren't out of the question. \"Job No. 1 is to remind people why they love Chipotle,\" Niccol told CNBC in March. \"I think there [are] opportunities to use what we have and present it in new forms, new varieties, to get people re-engaged with what they love about Chipotle.\" Such initiatives are likely welcome news to investors like Pershing Square activist Bill Ackman, who has leveraged a 10 percent stake in the company to encourage ideas like drive-thrus and breakfast offerings to reignite the beleaguered shares following a series of food safety issues. \"We're not just betting on a recovery from the food safety issue,\" Ackman told CNBC in November. \"This is one of the least optimized of thequick-servicee restaurants.\" It appears Ackman isn't the only investor willing to give Chipotle another chance. Shares of the casual Mexican eatery are up roughly 70 percent since the Chipotle board announced Niccol's appointment on Feb. 13, while a recent hike to menu prices helped the Mexican eatery post better-than-expected earnings last month. The improved performance announced April 25 sent shares soaring 24 percent the next day, their best day since the company went public in 2006, when its share price doubled.

Against that background, displays of bonhomie on official occasions look like a polite gloss of convenience on a centuries-old hostility of neighbors living the illusion of harmony and cooperation. After a decade of taking a back seat to Germany in economic policy and European affairs, France is now moving center stage in denouncing what it calls the German \"fetishism of trade and budget surpluses\" at the expense of the rest of Europe and a wider world. France, correctly, sees these policies as a serious obstacle to its proposals to strengthen the European project. Predictably, Germany is stalling, while the hostility of the German media sounds like an intention to bring the young French upstart \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 down to the real world by showing him who's the boss. \"Don't be afraid,\" says Macron Paris, however, is neither fooled nor intimidated. The highly educated French president is no shrinking violet, as he showed in his frontal attack on Trump's policies during his address to the joint session of the U.S. Congress last month. He knows that his ideas about the future of Europe and the French-German relations are issues for serious debate. He also knows that Germany's peremptory dismissal of his reform proposals are signs of vulnerability because he is pressing the right buttons. Here is what's at stake. In several of his speeches last year, Macron proposed measures mostly focused on the 19-nation monetary union that should serve as a strong core of the European Union consisting of 28 member states (or 27 if the UK concludes the separation agreement by the spring 2019). Among the key proposals are a common euro area finance minister, a legislative and executive authority and a budget to finance the euro area's economic, social and fiscal convergence. Suffering from a protracted interregnum last year, Germany took all that as an affront. Macron's pIan was dead on arrival in Berlin, shot to pieces well in advance in a typical NIH (not invented here) manner. The whole thing was ridiculed as an exercise in building unnecessary bureaucracy and imposing new financial burdens. Berlin prefers to talk about its own priorities, such as the mandatory EU quotas for taking migrants that Germany invited and could no longer manage, digital economy and the completion of the euro area banking union. True to form, the German \"down-to-earth\" talk is also accompanied by the usual violins about staying competitive to push exports. Make no mistake, this French-German kabuki show is a deadly serious power play. As a well-informed analyst of the European political scene, Macron is moved by a number of fundamental factors underlying the future of the European project. Macron again: \"The time to act is now!\" One, his plan for a complete federal structure of the monetary and fiscal union is meant to guarantee the strength and the finality of the European project and its legal tender. Two, such a structure would be impossible to deconstruct by nationalists, populists and similar constituencies blaming all sorts of socio-economic problems on the EU's single market and the common currency. Three, I'll take the liberty of ascribing to Macron this unstated thought: His euro area reform program would also make it impossible for Germany to boss people around; the administrative setup he proposes would unfailingly and routinely enforce the rules of the monetary and fiscal union. The focus is now on the meeting of the European Council \u2014 a forum of EU heads of state and government \u2014 on June 28-29, where France and Germany are supposed to present a joint \"road map\" of European reforms. French commentators of all stripes expect a damp squib, accusing Macron of talking too much instead of \"banging his fist on the table.\" Responding to that criticism, the French presidency announced last week that it was looking for substantive decisions next month. Wish them luck, because Germany does not seem ready for substantive decisions on anything. In her speech last week to celebrate Macron's Charlemagne Prize (for contributions to the cause of the European Union), German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke mainly of the problems the U.S. was creating for the German economy with its unilateral sanctions on Iran. Macron, in her words, was \"bubbling with ideas,\" but said nothing about Germany's response, or what Germany was prepared to do to help \"Europe take its destiny in its own hands.\" The reaction to the fallout from Washington's Iran sanctions is characteristic of ambiguity in French-German relations. In spite of statements that the two countries wanted to stay in Iran's nuclear agreement, Paris and Berlin are working on separate tracks to get exemptions from the U.S.-imposed sanctions on their companies involved in multi-year and multi-billion deals with Tehran. France says that the extraterritorial reach of Trump's Iran sanctions is \"unacceptable,\" while Germany remains resigned that \"nothing can be done about it.\" Following that conclusion, Germany is talking about post-Trump policies, because Berlin presumably expects that next November's mid-term Congressional elections can cripple what they apparently believe will be a one-term presidency. More realistically, Germany seems to be counting on China and Russia (and perhaps India) to reject Washington's unilateral sanctions on Iran \u2014 offering a way out the German-led Europe is unable to find on its own. All eyes are now on Iran's ongoing talks in Beijing and Moscow, and a visit of Tehran's delegation to Brussels next Tuesday. Investment thoughts Investors voting with their savings on euro-denominated assets may wish to follow closely the French-German clash about measures that are necessary to strengthen the European project. These are crucially important steps to make irrevocable the EU's single market and the euro as a legal tender. France has posed that question in the form of far-reaching reforms to mend Europe's dangerous fault lines and set the famously fractious continent on a path to peace, harmony and prosperity. So far, Germany has shown no interest to cooperate, but France, apparently, won't give up. A prominent French philosopher reminded the body politic last week that \"article one of Macronist doctrine is attachment to the idea of a united Europe.\" Trump has made this intra-European discord more difficult with extraterritorial economic and financial implications of his wide-ranging sanctions. By withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, and threatening sanctions on any company working with Iranian counterparts, Trump could potentially tear up the fragile European project. I am not betting on that, but those who argue that Trump's disruptions could achieve the opposite result ignore deeply entrenched divisions and outright hostilities plaguing what people still hopefully call the European Union. You want to take a bet? Here is mine: Macron will win and Italy will soon get a pro-European prime minister with little patience for Germany. The fiercely independent and highly professional European Central Bank will remain a pillar of the steadily growing euro area economy. Trump will be \"convinced\" by China, Russia and India \u2014 all actively trading with Tehran as an ally \u2014 to scale back his Iranian hostilities.

Images HSBC claimed on Monday it had performed the world's first commercially viable trade finance transaction using blockchain technology. The bank issued a letter of credit for U.S. food and agriculture firm Cargill. The trade finance transaction involved a bulk shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia. The letter of credit was issued from HSBC to Dutch lender ING. Letters of credit are issued by one bank to another to guarantee that a payment will be received by a seller under a set of conditions. Traditionally this process would take a large amount of time, numerous paper records, and a lot of back and forth between the various parties involved. Blockchain technology promises to change that. Blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, enables transactions to be recorded across a vast network of computers. In the case of bitcoin, it records all of the transactions that happen on the network, creating a public ledger. Banks have taken the principles behind bitcoin's blockchain \u2013 such as the idea of decentralized ledger \u2013 and tried to apply it to processes that they are carrying out. For this transaction, HSBC used a platform developed by blockchain start-up R3 called Corda. R3 works with a consortium of banks to come up with blockchain solutions to a variety of problems. show chapters What is Blockchain? 9:08 AM ET Mon, 4 June 2018 | 04:44 \"The need for paper reconciliation is removed because all parties are linked on the platform and updates are instantaneous,\" Vivek Ramachandran, head of growth and innovation at HSBC, said in a statement. \"The quick turnaround could mean unlocking liquidity for businesses.\" HSBC and ING said that the exchange was performed in 24 hours, compared to the five-to-10 days it normally takes to complete such exchanges through a paper-based system. Proponents of blockchain claim it has the potential to upend various industries. Sectors like trade finance, health care and insurance are thought of as good targets for the use the technology as they rely on long paper trails. While there have been proof-of-concept transactions performed using blockchain technology, HSBC's was the first that could have commercial applications, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. Banks have been pouring money into blockchain projects as it is thought that the technology will significantly disrupt the financial services. While lenders are not fond of the original use case of blockchain \u2014 to underpin cryptocurrency transactions \u2014 many see practical use for the technology because of its ability to handle massive amounts of data within a transparent, immutable network. Last month, Santander teamed up with blockchain firm Ripple to create a foreign exchange service that enables same-day international money transfers.

The probability that the central bank will raise its benchmark rate a fourth time this year went above 50 percent for the first time, according to the CME's FedWatch tracking tool for the fed funds futures market. Futures contracts are currently implying a funds rate of 2.21 percent from the current range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. According to the CME, that translates into a 51 percent chance of a December rate hike, which would be the fourth of the year. The Fed already approved one quarter-point hike, in March. Futures trading indicates a 95 percent chance of a June increase \u2014 the probability had been 100 percent as recently as last week \u2014 and an 81.4 percent likelihood of another move in September. show chapters Interest rate move will be less important this year than the rate path, says expert 8:11 AM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 03:38 As things stand, Fed officials currently are indicating a total of three hikes this year. However, the Federal Open Market Committee meets in June, during which members will get a chance to update their forecasts. Hawkish expectations are rising even though inflation pressures have been held at bay. The personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and energy is at 1.9 percent, and the Dallas Fed's inflation gauge is at 1.8 percent, both narrowly below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. In addition, wage pressures have been low, with average annual earnings rising a less-than-expected 2.6 percent annualized for April. However, Fed officials, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, have been expressing concern about the effects that loose monetary policy can have on asset valuations. Also, the unemployment rate's drop to 3.9 percent could weigh on Fed officials who follow the Phillips Curve, an economic model that indicates wage pressures will rise as the jobless level falls. Recently enacted fiscal stimulus in the form of lower taxes and higher spending levels also could prove inflationary. \"Now, with fiscal policy turning from restrictive to stimulative, the economy growing above trend, and investment rising, the short-term equilibrium interest rate is rising, too,\" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech Monday in Paris. \"As the expansion continues, it could be that in order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move the fed funds rate, for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the longer run.\" Mester is considered one of the Fed's more hawkish members.

Including HP, Dell and other companies that don't break out their China revenues brings the total estimate to around $150 billion, the analysts said. The U.S.-China trade dispute has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. In mid-April, the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE for seven years. The decision was a response to ZTE's violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea, to which the Chinese company pleaded guilty last year. Trading in its Hong Kong and Shenzhen-listed shares was halted after the ban, and last week the company said its main business operations have ceased. However, President Donald Trump unexpectedly said Sunday that he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE \"get back into business, fast.\" Shares of optical component makers working directly or indirectly with ZTE rose in Monday morning trading: Acacia Communications received 30 percent of 2017 total revenue from the Chinese telecom company. Shares closed up 8.7 percent. Oclaro generated 18 percent of fiscal year 2017 revenue from ZTE. Shares closed up 2.9 percent.

It still may be considered an emerging technology, but Federated Investors portfolio manager Steve Chiavarone is folding the electronic system, which records cryptocurrency transactions, into his stock market forecast. \"This is going to be one of five key technologies \u2014 along with automation, robotics, A.I.

Bitcoin, which has been referred to as the FANG stock of the crypto world, has been struggling to break $10,000 \u2014 just months after hitting a record price just shy of $20,000 last December. In fact, Chiavarone sees FANG stocks, which include top tech names Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google [Alphabet], as ultimately reaping benefits from blockchain's processing power \u2014 as well as areas from health care to financials. \"A lot of investors went to bitcoin first because it was the first way to access blockchain,\" added Chiavarone. \"Look, big banks are investing in this heavily. Bank of America boasted at Davos earlier this year that they're investing the most.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Chiavarone believes blockchain technology is valuable because it could potentially transform reconciliation, the action of verifying account balances in corporate America. \"It has an ability to replace reconciliation, which is expensive and requires back office and time and paperwork with more instantaneous verification,\" he said. \"What that means is companies can have more efficient supply chains. They can cut their back and middle office costs,\" Chiavarone said. \"And, that will allow business to flow more efficiently and it'll allow costs to be cut and net savings to be passed along.\" show chapters From earnings to the crypto space, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bulls makes case for new highs 6:13 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 04:57 Disclaimer ", "author": "Alexander Demianchuk | TASS | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/blockchain-to-help-drive-next-industrial-revolution-federated.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Blockchain", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "6:13 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "11", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "01:45 One of Wall Street's", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Federated Investors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Steve Chiavarone", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "five", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "A.I.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trading Nation", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "FANG", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "10,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "just months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "last December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Chiavarone", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "FANG", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Google [Alphabet", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Chiavarone", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bank of America", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Davos", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Vote Vote", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "a Scientific Survey", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "100%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "America", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Chiavarone", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "6:13 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "11", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Federated Investors\u2019 Steve Chiavarone believes blockchain will ultimately play a major role in economic growth.", "title": "Blockchain will help \u2018drive the next industrial revolution,\u2019 a Wall Street bull predicts", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/10/26/104799506-GettyImages-854047464.jpg?v=1526076019"}, {"time": "2018-05-15T14:50:02-0400", "body": " David A.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Board agreed there was not a \"strong case\" for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy, Tuesday's six-page minutes showed. The Board still agrees the next move was more likely up than down, assuming the economy gathered momentum as expected. The RBA last cut rates to 1.5 percent in August 2016, notching up the longest period without a change in modern history. Financial markets are wagering this steady spell could last well into 2019. Crucially, wage growth and inflation has undershot expectations for some years and showed little sign of heating up soon. Data due Wednesday is likely to show wage growth stayed near all-time lows at an annual 2.1 percent in the quarter-ended March, even as brisk job gains are expected on Thursday. RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech ahead of Tuesday's minutes that Australia's wage growth has \"troughed\" and there are some tentative signs of pressure emerging. However, there is a risk it may take a lower unemployment rate than currently expected to generate a sustained move higher, he added. Australia's jobless rate has remained stubbornly stuck around 5.5 percent and levels of underemployment \u2014 those already working but wanting more hours \u2014 are near historical highs, a major factor weighing on wages. Indeed, the RBA expects the unemployment rate to stay there by year-end. It is seen ticking lower to 5.25 percent by 2020. \"Stronger (economic) growth was expected over the following couple of years, which could reduce spare capacity in the economy and lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate,\" the RBA said. \"The increase in wages growth and inflation was expected to be gradual however because spare capacity in the economy was expected to be reduced only slowly.\" Policymakers remained upbeat about the outlook for Australia's A$1.8 trillion economy, expecting activity to pick-up to a little above 3 percent over the next two years after a somewhat disappointing 2.4 percent outcome last year. Household consumption, which has been a key area of uncertainty over the past year, had grown \"solidly\" last year, the RBA said, adding recent data on retail and motor vehicle sales suggested the momentum has continued in early 2018. The RBA said stricter lending criteria by banks had helped in containing the build-up of risk on household balance sheets.

Mester said she does not expect inflation to pick up sharply, adding that while it is close to the Fed's symmetric 2 percent target, it will only reach that level on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. \"We want to give inflation time to move back to goal ... this argues against a steep path,\" she said. The Fed unanimously decided to raise borrowing costs at its policy meeting in March. It forecasts another two rate rises for this year, although an increasing number of policymakers see three as a possibility. Policymakers raised rates three times last year. The Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate now sits in a target range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation increased to 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March, effectively bringing price gains to the central bank's 2 percent target after undershooting that goal in recent years. Mester, who has a vote on monetary policy this year under a rotation system, also said the central bank could raise rates more rapidly if the U.S. economy grew faster than expected, though she added it could go slower if inflation weakens again. Her views are consistent with the Fed's policy statement earlier this month. It emphasized that policymakers do not see their 2 percent inflation target as a ceiling, and will not be unduly concerned with price gains above it for a time. Mester also used her speech to a central banking conference to once again reiterate her stance that the central bank should begin to analyze whether its inflation framework is fit for the future. \"Now is the time to assess whether changes to our current framework could make monetary policy more effective in achieving our goals,\" she said. Several others on the Fed's rate-setting committee have also called for a review this year on whether to stick to the current inflation policy, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has yet to publicly show support for such a move. Investors have fully priced in a rate rise at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 12-13.

Instead, two of the luxury cars were from Broadway Supercars, a New Jersey-based car rental, and one belonged to company founder John Nouri. He said he was hired to park the cars for about five hours Monday morning on Sixth Ave just outside a Hilton hotel, where more than 8,500 people are expected to attend CoinDesk's Consensus conference that kicked off Monday. It's part of a promotion for the conference, and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, he said. \"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber.

A Lamborghini can cost about $200,000 or more, and the luxury cars have become an internet symbol for volatile cryptocurrencies' massive potential for wealth creation. \"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and \u2026 the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview.

The two outlets said Monday U.S. and Chinese officials are working on a deal that would reprieve China's ZTE from sanctions which prohibit U.S. companies from selling components to the company. In exchange, Beijing would remove tariffs on U.S. soybeans, the reports said, which cited people familiar with the matter. Soybeans futures jumped the reports, with futures for July delivery trading $14.50 higher at $1,017.75 per 5,000 bushels. China announced a 25 percent charge on 106 U.S. products early last month. These products included soybeans, cars and whiskey. The move by China followed President Donald Trump unveiling a list of Chinese imports he aimed at cracking down on.

Two days after Chris Matta earned a prized promotion at storied investment bank Goldman Sachs, he shocked his bosses. He decided to walk away from it all. It was mid-December, and Matta had just been told that after six grueling years toiling at Goldman, he had made vice president. Matta, who oversaw billions of dollars in investments in the wealth management division, had just climbed a rung of Wall Street's hierarchy and was in line for more pay and status. But Matta, 28, had a new goal in mind. All throughout 2017, the bitcoin he owned exploded in value. With the help of two former colleagues from Goldman, Matta wanted to create an investment vehicle to take advantage of the intense interest in cryptocurrencies. He couldn't wait. \"It's safe to say, you leave a good amount of money on the table walking away from Goldman,'' said Matta, who resembles Jared Dunn, a character from the HBO show \"Silicon Valley.\" \"But I saw it as a calculated risk.'' show chapters BK's crypto class: Know when to FODL 'em 6:14 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 05:35 Matta's unusually swift departure \u2014 he didn't even stick around to get the bonus he had earned that year \u2014 is a sign of the powerful lure of cryptocurrencies. Fortunes were made last year, when a single bitcoin surged from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. That sparked a bull market in new crypto-based funds jockeying for a piece of the action. Matta declined to say how much his bonus would have been. Digital currencies are the latest competition Wall Street faces for the young talent that fuels their businesses. In a previous era, thousands of the best and brightest young men and women flocked to Wall Street for a shot at making a fortune. Those who became managing directors \u2014 a level or two above vice president \u2014 could expect to earn millions of dollars a year. Some truly struck gold, such as Andrew Hall, a Citigroup commodities trader who made $100 million in 2008. No place epitomized Wall Street's allure quite like Goldman Sachs, a 149-year-old investment bank that had been the most profitable securities firm in history. The firm has produced so many senior executives and public officials, including two Treasury secretaries in the past decade, it's jokingly referred to as Government Sachs. After post-financial-crisis regulations curbed risk-taking and pay, for some the banks have turned into training grounds where valuable connections are made before leaving for something better. Now, the smart kids are leaving Wall Street to hit it big. When Matta's boss \u2014 a Goldman partner and suspenders-wearing embodiment of old-school Wall Street \u2014 heard about Matta's decision, he summoned him to his office. \"They called in the CEO of my organization, and he said, basically, 'Are you crazy? Do you realize the risk you are taking here?''' Matta said. \"'You are giving up on your bonus!'\" His managers had a counter-pitch: stick around until February to collect your bonus. But Matta and his co-founders, Ali Hassan and Michael Kazley, all under 30 years old, wanted to set up shop and start taking in client money by Jan. 1. So while his former colleagues were enjoying the holidays, Matta and his friends were pouring their life savings into setting up their new firm, Crescent Crypto Asset Management. \"In the crypto world, every month is like a year in the equities space,'' Matta said. \"The amount of things that would change in that time, the number of funds that would come to market, it would just be a much more difficult landscape for us if we were trying to get things up and running in February.'' Matta, who grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, and studied economics and finance in college, started at Goldman Sachs in 2011 in the bank's summer analyst program. He had roles in risk management and big data technology solutions, and then shifted into the bank's wealth management division, eventually helping oversee $7 billion in a philanthropy fund and a trust portfolio. By 2016, Matta became intrigued by bitcoin. show chapters From earnings to the crypto space, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bulls makes case for new highs 6:13 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 04:57 \"At Goldman you're always looking for alternative asset classes, and I said, maybe this is an alternative investment that we should start to take seriously,'' Matta said. The mania around the rise of cryptocurrencies has parallels to the dot-com boom from 20 years ago. Then, too, it wasn't uncommon for Wall Street bankers to head west to Silicon Valley in search of fortunes. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had a series of finance jobs, including at a Deutsche Bank predecessor and quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw.) The rise of cryptocurrencies has sparked a bull market in hedge funds tied to the assets. While only five existed before 2013, more than 200 were created since 2017, according to Autonomous Research. By the time bitcoin and other coins began their dizzy ascent in 2017, Matta was known at work and with family as a crypto expert. \"People were asking us about it nonstop, saying, 'I'll give you $50,000, can you do this for me?''' The three founders are taking what they've learned on Wall Street and applying it to an asset class that was created to disrupt financial institutions. Their inaugural product is an index fund made up of the 20 largest coins; they charge 2 percent of assets under management. Gains have been harder to come by this year. Concerns over regulation, fraud and high-profile hacks drove bitcoin down at the start of the year, losing more than half its value in January. It has since whipsawed investors, trading between about $6,000 and $10,000. Matta is undeterred. He believes that digital currencies and the blockchain technology underpinning it have the potential to transform finance in ways that are hard to imagine. \"It's either going to zero, or it's going magnitudes higher,'' he said. Still, their little company has already had some success. Matta said they have made progress toward their goal of attracting $50 million in assets this year. They've hired five employees for a research desk. They are also in discussions with established trading firms seeking to make strategic investments in Crescent Crypto, Matta said. Ironically, the three men have Goldman to thank for their success so far. \"The Goldman brand is obviously very strong; people respect its people,\" Matta said. \"It gets you in the door in a lot of cases.\" And the investment bank is still a strong lure for talent, attracting a quarter of a million annual applicants for a few thousand positions. The talent system at investment banks relies on a steady stream of hungry young men and women to populate their trading floors, and most end up leaving. Matta said that when he left, he was one of the last members from his summer program. He figures that even if crypto goes bust or his fund fails to get traction and his savings are wiped out, he's gained invaluable connections and experience. In that case, Goldman could welcome him back, although he would prefer working for a start-up, he said. \"I don't regret it at all,'' Matta said. \"It's been the most exciting few months of my life, honestly.''

The cryptocurrency went on to top $19,000 seven months later in December. But it has since lost more than half its value and was trading near $8,700 Monday morning. More than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are scheduled around Consensus as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. \"It is a bit chaotic in here,\" said Ronnie Moas, head of independent market research firm Standpoint Research. \"I think they sold too many tickets.\" \"Everyone is here.

Morgan. According to the bank's analysis, Amazon's U.S. gross merchandise volume (GMV) \u2014 a key industry metric measuring total dollar value of merchandise sold online \u2014 is set to match Walmart's net U.S. sales by 2020 or 2021. \"Amazon is the second-largest U.S. retailer and fastest growing at scale,\" analyst Christopher Horvers wrote Monday. \"We believe key drivers of Amazon's share gains include: the Prime ecosystem; endless aisle driven by third-party seller expansion; outsized growth in large, underpenetrated categories; and removing friction and moving closer to customers.\" Though Walmart remains king of sales with $495.8 billion in annual revenue and U.S. sales of $318.5 billion (a 3.5 percent increase year over year) for the fiscal year ended in January, Amazon is growing at a faster pace in the United States.

J.P. Morgan expects this number to hit roughly 140 million in 2019. The company recently announced that it would raise prices for its premium membership to $119 from $99, a move Wall Street applauded as beneficial to its revenue base. \"Prime delivers such massive scale and features that we believe it would be very difficult for any company to replicate,\" Horvers added. \"The company offers same-day free shipping on more than a million items for Prime members when ordered before noon in 8,000 cities and towns. Prime Now goes a step further and guarantees two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items in 32 U.S. cities.\" While the price increases are pushing Amazon's stock even higher, Horvers noted that the company is still accruing market share, predicting that it will jump to 50 percent of e-commerce sales from 41 percent of sales over the next few years. J.P. Morgan has an overweight rating on Amazon shares.

In a stunning election victory last week, the Pakatan Harapan opposition alliance beat the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which had been in power for the past 60 years. \"The two keywords ... are 'if' and 'could. The rating agencies have said, yes, there's some credit negative aspects to the potential fiscal policy, but it's still some way off,\" Ashley Perrott, head of pan-Asia fixed income at UBS Asset Management, told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford. \"I think yes, if they follow through with everything they're talking about doing, the infrastructure concerns, the GST (goods and services tax) repeal, that could be credit negative, sure. But I think that's six months before we really get something concrete from the agencies,\" he added. The country's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had pledged during the campaign trail to scrap the unpopular GST and following his victory, added that infrastructure projects committed to by ousted leader Najib Razak will be re-looked. But Moody's Investor Service had cautioned in a note on Monday that replacing GST with a proposed sales and services tax \u2014 without corresponding measures to match revenue collection \u2014 could prove to be credit negative for Malaysia. \"There is little clarity on Pakatan Harapan's economic policy agenda, apart from a few specific campaign pledges that are credit negative at the outset, but lack details that would allow a full assessment of budgetary and macroeconomic effects,\" Anushka Shah, sovereign risk group senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, said in a note. But what Malaysia could lose in tax revenues would be diminished by the broad move higher in oil prices \u2014 good news for the oil exporter. \"If they were to repeal the GST in an environment where oil prices were actually declining \u2014 you go back 12 months, that was the story \u2014 that would be much more problematic,\" Perrott said, adding that oil prices at their current levels allowed for fiscal flexibility for the government. The yield on the 10-year Malaysian government bond last stood at 4.21 percent after earlier yielding 4.255 percent, its highest since January 2017. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The tech giant announced on Tuesday that it is working with Veridium Labs, a firm that creates environment-related cryptocurrencies, to make it easier to trade carbon credits using blockchain technology. Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, is most popularly known as the tech that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It enables participants to register transactions across a vast network of computers. But, increasingly, firms in other sectors are showing an interest in distributed ledger because of its ability to handle massive amounts of data within a transparent, immutable network. Veridium will use IBM's technology to issue and manage carbon credit-backed tokens on the blockchain network created by Stellar, another start-up IBM has been working with. IBM said the carbon credit tokens will be fungible, meaning that they can be exchanged for another asset of the same type. What are carbon credits? Carbon credits are permits that allow governments and other organizations to emit a limited amount of carbon dioxide with the aim of reducing their carbon footprint. The certificates limit emissions to the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide. While environmental credits are already traded, IBM and Veridium said that the current structure of the market creates too much friction. \"Right now, if you look at the carbon credit market \u2014 specifically the voluntary carbon credit market \u2014 they're traded through bilateral agreements which means there's a lot of friction involved,\" Jared Klee, director of digital asset registry at IBM, told CNBC in a phone call. \"They're not fungible assets, you see that in pricing that one can be very different, the same asset with large price fluctuations between two of them. And we see that reflected in other places like secondary volumes and what not.\" show chapters World Bank's Roome: You can still grow your economy by pricing carbon 10:25 AM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 | 01:55 The initial carbon credit tokens will include Triple-Gold Certified REDD+ credits from InfiniteEARTH, a company owned by Veridium's parent organization EnVision. IBM and Veridium also plan to eventually let traders hedge potential environmental impacts using the blockchain platform, Klee said. IBM's bet on blockchain Big Blue partnered with blockchain start-up Stellar in 2017 on a payments platform that uses the latter's lumens tokens to rapidly clear and settle cross-border payments. Several cryptocurrencies, including Stellar's, shot up in value late last year, with bitcoin's price coming close to nearly $20,000 a coin. Stellar's cryptocurrency is currently the eighth-largest in terms of market value, according to industry website CoinMarketCap. Rather than functioning as a cryptocoin like bitcoin, Stellar's digital token lets users exchange government-backed currencies. But IBM has said is not interested in the cryptocurrency aspect of blockchain technology. IBM's blockchain is permissioned, meaning it only allows a limited number of trusted parties to access it. This is different to bitcoin's blockchain, which lets any user access it. The company has been investing heavily in the technology, forging partnerships with the likes of Walmart and Nestle on tracing food contamination, and creating a joint venture with shipping giant Maersk on trade.

Baldet's post-J.P. Morgan plans have been the topic of speculation since she announced her departure from the bank in April.

Baldet co-founded Clovyr with Patrick Nielsen, who led development for J.P.

This is a very delicate balance,\" Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.

Futures contracts are currently implying a funds rate of 2.21 percent \u2014 from the current range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.

To be more precise, his time frame is one to two years, or by 2020. As a result, Cox recommended that investors insulate their portfolios with dividend stocks. Names that \"aren't necessarily recession-proof,\" he said. \"But they tend to be resilient.\" \"Mobile services are a perfect example, because the last thing you're going to do during a recession is turn off your phone,\" Cox said. Companies with solid fundamentals are a buying opportunity as interest rates rise and prices drop during sell-offs, he said. \"There's no business condition causing the stocks to fall,\" Cox said. \"It's just the interest rates. So they'll go back up again.\" Some sectors to consider are telecom, utilities and consumer staples, Cox said. He recommended Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, AT&T, Verizon and Procter & Gamble. Cox pointed out that a company like Procter & Gamble was performing badly year to date. \"But people need toothpaste,\" he said. \"Like any other investment,\" Cox said, \"it doesn't necessarily pay off right away. What you're trying to do is build your portfolio for income or whatever you're trying to do for the future.\" On Tuesday, stocks fell, with all major indexes opening lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 200 points, the S&P 500 shed 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite declined 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, hit its highest level since 2011 on Tuesday, at 3.09 percent. In addition, many market watchers fear the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as many as four times this year. The first rate increase in 2018 was after the central bank's March meeting. But Cox said the likelihood of four hikes is small. At some point the positive effects for companies from the Republican tax law are going to wear off and some of those corporations \"are going to stop buying things,\" Cox said. \"That's going to cause a recession or slowdown in the economy.\" He warns investors not to assume, \"stocks are going to stay up forever.\" \"They're not going to,\" Cox said. \"Particularly the high-flying ones.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield rose to its highest level since 2011 on Tuesday, while the short-term two-year yield traded near levels not seen in about a decade, raising concern about how portfolio managers will navigate this changing investment landscape. But most of them have never operated in a rising rates environment. Themedian tenure of an active equity manager is eight years, according to Fundstrat, citing figures gathered from Morningstar. The last time rates were in a significant uptrend was from 2003 to 2006 before the financial crisis struck. \"There are a lot of people that haven't been through many things in this youthful industry,\" said Timothy Parton, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan. \"The time when rates are rising coincides with a period in the cycle that is tough for any manager. You don't want to be too cautious, but you don't want to be too aggressive too early.\" The Fed slashed the overnight rate down to zero in 2008 during the aftermath of the financial crisis. The central bank's goal at the time was to stimulate the economy. Now that the economy is out of its financial-crisis trough, the Fed has started to gradually hike rates closer to historical levels and market rates have responded. show chapters Earnings and interest rates driving markets, Fidelity's Jurrien Timmer says 1:50 PM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 08:07 Since late 2015, the Fed has raised rates a total of six times \u2014 including once this year \u2014bringing the overnight rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Market participants are expecting the Fed to raise rates at least twice more in 2018 and many think they may even raise four times. \"We're concerned about rising interest rates,\" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. \"Last year, we got a lot of multiple expansion. We think that's unlikely in a rising rate environment.\" J.P. Morgan's Parton and Allianz's Price have seen their share of rising-rate cycles. Parton has worked in portfolio management since the late 1980s, while Price has 45 years of experience in the financial industry. How to invest in rising rates Parton has managed the JPMorgan Growth Advantage Fund (VHIAX) \u2014 a four-star rate fund \u2014 since 2002. Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned 13.5 percent, according to Morningstar. The fund is also ranked in the 2nd percentile of the \"Large Growth\" category and has $8.6 billion in assets. He said the key to successfully dealing with rising rates is investing in companies \"that will continue to deliver regardless of the economic cycles.\" He named Facebook as an example of such companies. \"Your Facebook engagement won't go down if you lose your job. If anything, it will go up.\" Parton's Advantage fund owns just over a million Facebook shares, making it one of its biggest holdings. Allianz's Price, meanwhile, has co-managed the AllianzGI Technology Fund Class C (RCGTX) fund since its inception in 2002. Over the past 15 years, the fund has returned 13.8 percent and ranks in the 22nd percentile among \"Technology\" funds, according to Morningstar. The fund also manages $1.6 billion in assets. \"What you have to do is look for companies with high earnings or low valuations,\" Price said about investing when rates are rising. He also said he likes semiconductor stocks right now, noting that \"many of the semis are priced like the cycle is ending. People think earnings are peaking for those companies, but we think they can continue to grow.\" Price's fund owns 1.2 million shares of Micron Technology, as well as 99,650 shares of Nvidia and 608,810 shares of Marvell Technology, Morningstar data show.

U.S. inflation is rising toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal while not accelerating enough to suggest the economy is overheating, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Tuesday. Inflation is approaching 2 percent but it's \"not running away from us,\" he said at an event titled \"Energy, Trade, and Energy Growth\" sponsored by the Council for Foreign Relations. Inflation data for April indicated further growth on domestic wages and consumer prices although they fell short of market expectations. Kaplan, who is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2018, said he expected the U.S. economy to grow about 2.50 percent to 2.75 percent in 2018, underpinned by the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years enacted last December. He cautioned the tax boost would fade in 2019, slowing gross domestic product to 1.75 percent to 2 percent growth rate by 2020. With businesses expanding and the consumer sector in \"pretty good shape,\" Kaplan said the Federal Reserve will likely stay on track to raise key overnight borrowing costs at a gradual pace. He told reporters after the event that he was not committed to whether the Fed would raise short-term interest rates two or three more times in 2018. Interest rates futures implied a more than a 50 percent chance the U.S. central bank would increase rates by year-end to bring its target range to 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The FOMC, which is scheduled to next meet on June 12-13, last raised its federal funds rate to 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent in March. Kaplan prefers US yield curve not invert Separately, Kaplan said he is keeping an eye on the shape of the U.S. yield curve and would be wary if it were to invert, a market move that has often preceded recent U.S. recessions. Kaplan, who spoke to reporters after an event sponsored by the Council for Foreign Relations, said he would not like to see the U.S. yield \"inadvertently\" invert, a move in which short-term U.S. bond yields rise above long-term ones.

The Goldman Sachs-backed start-up announced a new cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar and a $110 million investment round led by profitable crypto-mining company Bitmain, which brings Circle's value near $3 billion, the company announced Tuesday. \"It unlocks an incredible amount of power for the dollar,\" said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle. \"It's basically a dollar that operates on blockchain.\" Circle is one of the most well-funded blockchain start-ups, with investors including Goldman Sachs Group and Baidu. The fintech company operates its peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. Circle's new USD Coin is meant to solve a key problem in digital currencies' use case: Volatility. Critics including Stan Druckenmiller have said cryptocurrencies can't be used as a means of payment because their value changes so often and so rapidly. Bitcoin, for example, has been marked by volatility in the past 12 months and has dropped by more than 50 percent since its high near $20,000 in December, according to CoinDesk. Circle customers will be required to hold $1 for every USD Coin, keeping the price stable. Other companies, such as Tether and Basis, also have offered \"stable coins\" with a value tied to the U.S. dollar. But Allaire said there's a need for a \"compliant alternative\" to Tether, which has a $2.2 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.com. show chapters Circle's CEO on the company's growth strategy 4:41 AM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 02:10 \"When I look at the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto space, it's begging for that,\" Allaire said to a room full of journalists. \"There are a number of banks who are excited about it and will support it.\" Once U.S. dollars are transferred to Circle's USD Coins, Allaire said they can be moved within seconds thanks to blockchain technology. He said they will eventually add tokens for the euro and pound but it's less likely they'll immediately look to peg most Asian currencies because of existing competition in that arena. The framework for the coin is what's called \"open sourced,\" meaning multiple developers can work on the project and help its development. The USD Coin project is being developed by an organization called CENTRE, which will provide independent oversight of Circle's offering. Bitmain, best known as a crypto \"mining\" company, is leading a $110 million strategic investment in Circle, which the company said brings its valuation close to $3 billion. The funding round also includes existing investors such as Breyer Capital, Tusk Ventures, IDG Capital, Pantera and Blockchain Capital. Bitcoin mining requires use of special software to solve math problems in exchange for a certain number of bitcoins.

The cloud computing giant will team with a new start-up launching Tuesday called Kaleido, which was born out of leading blockchain incubator known as Consensys. The company is aiming to give AWS customers an \"easy button\" to get into the same technology that underpins bitcoin. \"They can focus on their scenario and they don't have to become PhDs is cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain,\" said Steve Cerveny, one of the founders of Kaleido. show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 Blockchain technology records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases. The technology is touted as faster and more secure by advocates. \"Introducing Kaleido to AWS customers is going to help customers move faster and not worry about managing blockchain themselves,\" Amazon Web Services said in a statement. It is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS Marketplace and will help them rapidly advance their blockchain projects.\" Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers a paid subscription for cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. AWS is using a partner-led strategy instead of building from the ground up. \"They've been looking for partners to help get blockchain into their customers' hands,\" Cerveny told CNBC. \"They're putting it in the marketplace will accelerate what their customers are going to do with it.\" The founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is what Kaleido and AWS will be using, said this is the biggest move yet by the tech giant to get into blockchain. \"This is a heavy duty, full stack way of getting the company into blockchain solutions,\" said Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum. Blockchain can help Amazon in other arms of the ever-expanding business he said, using supply chain as one example. Lubin said Consensys, which oversees more than 50 blockchain projects, has seen a major increase in interest around the technology. \"Three years ago we were getting calls from companies trying to spell blockchain and trying to order one in a color because their boss told them they should get a blockchain,\" Lubin said. \"At this point there are tens of thousands of companies around the world that have real sophistication around this.\" Amazon joins other tech giants including Microsoft and Facebook exploring use cases for blockchain. Facebook announced last week it is going through a reorganization that will include a new blockchain effort and aims to address privacy concerns. The experimental blockchain group will be led by David Marcus, the executive most recently in charge of Facebook's Messenger group. IBM, Accenture, Deloitte, JP Morgan, and HSBC are among the other corporate names working on blockchain initiatives.

The bank also said it aims to resume its dividend payouts for this year. Commerzbank's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Stephan Engels told CNBC's Annette Weisbach in Frankfurt Tuesday that the company's plan to win business from smaller rivals was paying off. \"The basic model that more customers means more assets and more assets is the foundation for more profitability is working. We are managing to compensate for the drag effect of negative interest rates,\" he said. Nonetheless, Commerzbank's strategy to gain market share and reap rewards when interest rates rise is coming under pressure from stuttering European growth. With European data appearing to soften in recent weeks, Engels did not foresee a rise in European interest rates until the second half of 2019. \"(At) the beginning of the year we had higher hopes on interest rate rises, and I think that we have seen a little bit of sobering of that view during this last quarter,\" he added. show chapters Don't believe Commerzbank will be involved in a large, cross-border merger: Axiom 5:30 AM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 01:59 Engels said he believed the European Central Bank would slow its asset purchase program in 2018 and that would benefit corporate yield spreads by the end of this year.

Top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is focusing on a group that has been especially cautious to dive into the volatile market: institutional investors. The San Francisco-based company announced the launch on Tuesday of four new products aimed at that investor class: Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Markets, The Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group and Coinbase Prime. \"We think this can unlock $10 billion of institutional investor money sitting on the sideline,\" said Adam White, vice president and general manager. \"We're seeing a rapid increase in attention awareness and adoption in the cryptocurrency market.\" show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 While bitcoin's 1,300 percent rise to almost $20,000 in 2017 was led by retail investors, the new products could usher in more institutional investors and solve the problems that made many of them wary of the space, White said. Security is one of those issues. Fiat money stored in banks is insured but in cryptocurrency, funds that are lost or stolen have little or no possibility of recovery. Coinbase is looking to be the trusted custodian by launching Coinbase Custody. The company has already stored more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency on behalf of customers through its exchange but until the announcement did not have a separate product to handle that. Coinbase Custody is a partnership with a SEC-regulated broker-dealer that will store cryptocurrency for its clients. Wall Street's interest in cryptocurrency seems to be increasing. There are currently 287 crypto hedge funds, up from 175 in a year earlier, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next. Only 20 hedge funds for cryptocurrency existed in 2016. Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking to open a cryptocurrency trading desk, and White said others will be quick to follow. \"Very few want to be first, but everyone wants to be second,\" he said. \"There will be fast followers.\" The 6-year old company says it has traded $150 billion in assets on its platform and has more than 20 million customers. Last year, it brought in a reported $1 billion in revenue, according to Recode, and has drawn in more than $225 million in funding from the world's top investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and the New York Stock Exchange. Recode also reported that the company valued itself at about $8 billion when it made an offer in its recent acquisition for Earn.com. Coinbase is best-known for its trading platform, which offers bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. It's now offering a separate platform exclusively for institutional investors called Coinbase Prime. \"The feedback we heard from institutional investors was 'Your infrastructure doesn't meet our expectations,'\" White said. \"We heard that loud and clear.\" The new platform will have a separate interface from Coinbase's GDAX exchange but all investors will have access to the same pool of liquidity. Coinbase Markets is the company's new electronic marketplace, which will be run out of an office opening in Chicago. It provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all of the company's products. The fourth product, Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group, was designed for \"white glove\" customer service that institutions like banks are used to. The group will be run out of the New York City office, and will help bring on board new clients and sell the service to additional investors looking to get into crypto. \"This is our public demonstration [that] we are absolutely here to serve institutions investing heavily to do that,\" White said.

Senior officials at scandal-plagued state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) withheld information from its board and took some decisions without the board's approval, according to a Malaysian government audit of the fund that was declassified on Tuesday. Malaysia, under former Prime Minister Najib Razak, had classified the audit report in 2016 under the Officials Secrets Act when the fund's financial troubles were being investigated. Reports had emerged by that time that about $700 million from 1MDB had gone to Najib's personal bank accounts. Najib denied any wrongdoing and the attorney general cleared him following local investigations. After Najib lost last week's election, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he would reopen investigations into 1MDB and declassify the audit report. He barred Najib and his wife from leaving the country, and has replaced the attorney general who cleared Najib. \"In several instances, the 1MDB management had presented incomplete or inaccurate information to the 1MDB board before an important decision was made and had taken action without the approval of the 1MDB board,\" according to the audit report's executive summary seen by Reuters. Auditor General Madinah Mohamad verified the authenticity of the report seen by Reuters. 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between 2009 and 2015, several decisions involving high-value investments were made through 1MDB board resolutions without detailed discussion or evaluation, the report said. Several high-risk investments were made in a very short time, and the 1MDB management went against the board's and the shareholders' wishes in some instances, it said. \"There were also instances where the 1MDB management gave inaccurate or different information to interested parties,\" the report said. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed civil lawsuits alleging that over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials and their associates. The lawsuits seek to seize about $1.7 billion in assets, including a luxury yacht and paintings, that were bought with 1MDB funds.

Sarah Wollaston, a lawmaker of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, described Broadbent's comments as \"pejorative tosh\". \"#Menopause only a problem if others try to sideline you because of ignorant prejudice,\" she tweeted. Broadbent's comments are likely to put the relative lack of gender diversity in senior management back in the spotlight. Last year lawmakers said they were disappointed by finance minister Philip Hammond's slow progress at encouraging greater diversity at the highest levels of the Bank. There are only three women out of more than 20 officials who serve on the BoE's three major policy committees, appointed by the finance ministry. In his apology, Broadbent said he had been trying to explain the word \"climacteric\", a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the nineteenth century. \"Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders,\" he said.

Daniel Pinto has seen his share of booms and busts. An Argentinean who spent much of his early career in volatile emerging markets, Pinto, 55, began at J.P. Morgan Chase in 1983 as a currency trader in Buenos Aires. Thanks to his ability to manage risk in a series of roles, Pinto has climbed the ranks. In 2014, he was named head of the firm's corporate and investment bank, the world's biggest by revenue. In January, he was named co-president of J.P. Morgan. That means he and partner Gordon Smith, who leads the consumer bank, are in line to succeed long-time CEO Jamie Dimon if the need arises within the next few years. show chapters J.P. Morgan names co-COOs and co-presidents Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith 5:20 PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 | 03:42 In an exclusive interview at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters and in a follow-up phone conversation, Pinto explains his views on a global economy in the latter stages of expansion, the opportunities he sees and how his bank is preparing for the inevitable downturn. CNBC: You spend a lot of time flying around the world visiting clients, leaders in industries from tech to energy. What are they telling you about the state of the economy? Pinto: Pretty much everyone agrees that the economy is in very good shape. Obviously, there are different dynamics in each of the sectors. For example, this week I was in Houston talking with some of the oil companies. They are quite positive about the economy, about oil prices maintaining a range, and they are quite positive about investments going into the sector. We have all these companies reporting earnings, and overall the results seem fine. The technical aspects of the markets are more balanced than they were late last year, where it was pretty much one view, and that view was that the markets will improve no matter what. So you have a bunch of components, from the technical part, to the economy performing and companies performing, which altogether makes me quite positive on the economy. CNBC: Where are you seeing opportunities now? You recently applied to Chinese regulators for a majority stake in a joint venture to control a business in a rapidly growing part of the world. Pinto: The opportunities in China are huge. You have a country that clearly is headed, in a slow way, towards deregulation, allowing foreign companies to have a majority stake in the financial services industry. It's a massive equity market, a massive bond market. The payments space is evolving extremely fast. So the opportunity is great. It will be a big contribution to J.P. Morgan and we will contribute to the Chinese market as the years go by and we keep growing our presence there. In particular, the joint venture will allow us to participate more deeply in the local equity markets, do underwritings, things like that. CNBC: Will China be your bank's second-biggest national market after the U.S. when it comes to revenue? How long will that take, a decade? Pinto: Yes. I have no doubt it will be, and it will happen a lot faster than 10 years. Bitcoin CNBC: Are cryptocurrencies another opportunity for you? Your competitors already help trade bitcoin futures and are preparing to get more involved in trading digital currencies. Pinto: We are looking into that space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. [Regarding bitcoin], you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities. That will have a very short life, because people will stop believing in it, or the regulators will kill it. I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form. If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No. CNBC: The current economic expansion is nearing a decade in age, double the average length. When does it end? Pinto: Obviously, there will be an end to the economic cycle at some point. I don't think it's coming any time soon. If you asked me when I thought the economy is going to slow down, I'd follow [JPMorgan Chief U.S. economist] Mike Feroli. He says that the probability of a recession is extremely low in 2018, it's higher in 2019, but still low. And it probably starts going up in 2020. CNBC: What would trigger a recession? Pinto: In the U.S., the risk is inflation. Does the Fed have to raise interest rates a lot faster than what the market is expecting or pricing in? For everything we can see, inflation is going up slightly, but in a very moderate way. That's why I think the probability of that happening this year or next year is relatively low. But the Fed will continue to hike, and at some point that hike in rates will slow down the U.S. economy. I don't believe that that is a crisis. It's just a correction at the end of the cycle that will trigger the beginning of the next cycle. Dealing with a bear market CNBC: You've said that within two or three years, the stock market could see a correction of 30 to 40 percent. How are you preparing the firm for this? Pinto: When you're going towards the end of the cycle, you want to have an extra layer of prudence. [In the investment bank] we're going to start being more careful about the liquidity of the book, about the concentration of illiquid risk, about the correlations, about how the positions will trade through different stress scenarios. You keep modeling the book to something that you hope, when the correction starts happening, you are well positioned to continue to be a player in the market, and you aren't shutting yourself out. The worst-case scenario for any big player is that you end up being massively hammered when the correction happens, and you end up losing money because of your positions. CNBC: Many Wall Street traders today are relatively young because after the financial crisis, firms sought to cut costs by eliminating more experienced, expensive talent. Is that a concern, for the industry, when conditions turn nasty? Pinto: All these people, whether they're senior or junior, lived in a bullish environment for the last 10 years. But I haven't, and many of my managers [have more experience], so we are prepared. CNBC: In the past decade, you've seen the rise of passive investments, the rise of computerized traders like quants, at the same time that regulations have curbed the ability for investment banks to deploy capital in markets. Will that impact the severity of the correction? Pinto: All these electronic, algorithmic traders, they provide a lot of liquidity in calm markets. So today, you can trade as much as you want every day. When the correction happens, these players tend to fall away, which exacerbates the moves. There's not as much smart capital [from investment banks] to really provide that rational support to market levels. That's why when the correction happens, or we have some kind of bad news, the market becomes very volatile and trading volumes shrink massively. We know how to prepare for those times, and over these days, we are slightly more conservative than we would've been a couple of years ago. We try to get through the difficult times as intact as possible to continue to provide liquidity to support the clients. That is in the minds of all the risk managers that we have, all my management team. Amazon as partner and competitor CNBC: Let's look a little further out. What about competition from tech firms like Amazon, which is reportedly looking to make a push into consumer banking by offering a checking account? Pinto: We work closely with Amazon. If there are things we can do together, we will try them. That doesn't preclude them from trying to be strong in financial services, to be strong in health care, in whatever they want to be, if they are allowed. The worst thing you can do is ignore it. You have to assume in some way or another, they will get involved. There's only one thing you can do. It's to create services that are as good as possible, and the best client experience, to have a shot. Ultimately, consumers will decide.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's top deputies are edging toward a clash that could shape the pace of interest-rate hikes in coming months, as well as how the Fed should prepare for and combat the next economic downturn. The fault lines are technical as well as philosophical and include a debate over whether the economy has shifted into a higher gear, giving the Fed room for more interest-rate hikes and perhaps reducing the need for controversial tools like bond-buying to fight future recessions. They come as tax cuts and government spending boost growth and inflation, giving policymakers the breathing room to debate whether to retool the Fed's basic policy approach to give themselves more firepower even if slower future economic growth is unavoidable. San Francisco Fed President John Williams launched a critical salvo in the debate on Tuesday with a speech underscoring his view that the Fed has only a few more rate hikes ahead of it before rates reach a level of borrowing costs that allows the economy to coast along, without stimulating or slowing its progress. This neutral rate, which can only be estimated and not observed, serves as a sort of speed limit on interest-rate hikes and is at the heart of the current policy debate. Stephen Lam | Reuters John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"It's important to distinguish between the current strong economic conditions and the key longer-run drivers underpinning interest rates,\" he said at the Economic Club of Minnesota. Despite economic tailwinds like tax cuts and government spending, \"the longer-run drivers still point to a 'new normal' of a low (neutral rate) and relatively low interest rates.\" Williams, whose research has helped convince most of his colleagues that the neutral rate of interest is much lower than in the past, stands to become even more influential when he takes over as chief of the New York Fed next month, a position that will make him a permanent voter on the Fed's policy-setting committee. His view contrasts with recent optimism from some economists and central bankers. Among them is the Fed vice chair for financial supervision, Randal Quarles, a Trump administration appointee who in February said he believed there is a \"real possibility\" that the economy could shift to a higher growth trajectory. Quarles' view suggests that the Fed has a bit more room to raise rates without braking the economy, which would, in turn, give it the flexibility to cut rates more deeply in the next downturn, and perhaps avoiding the need for unconventional measures like bond purchases. Fed Board nominee Richard Clarida, at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, flagged some discomfort with such measures, which began in the depths of the financial crisis to stabilize banks and were later were expanded to help bring down high unemployment and lift excessively low inflation. Though the Fed's initial program of so-called quantitative easing \"made sense,\" Clarida said he was not sure how he would have voted on subsequent rounds, and said in response to a question from Republican Senator Pat Toomey that he was \"very sympathetic to your view that any discussion and thinking about QE would have to take a serious look at costs as well as benefits.\" Williams for his part on Tuesday called bond-buying an important part of the policy-easing tools that the Fed \"is going to have to turn to\" to fight future downturns. Rate cuts alone, from what will be a relatively low starting point and only able to fall as far as zero, would not provide enough firepower to stimulate the economy, he has said in the past. Williams has also said that \"time is pressing\" for a rethink of the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. A new policy framework, he has said, conceivably could give the central bank more room for maneuver even with a low neutral rate by allowing it to defer rate hikes after a recession even if inflation pushes up to, or even past, its long-run target. Several other Fed policymakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, have lent support to a debate on the framework. Quarles by contrast has suggested that there is little need to rethink the framework if inflation rises back to the Fed's 2 percent target, as it has lately done. Clarida did not weigh in on that debate on Tuesday, or on his view of the neutral rate. But if he and fellow nominee Michelle Bowman are confirmed it is a topic that will heat up in coming months.

Since Square deals with fiat currency, Dorsey said the company has to approach each market differently, find a unique banking partner, and work with different regulators depending on the country. Square launched cryptocurrency trading through its Cash app in January. The payments processing company said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter. Square spent $33.9 million to buy bitcoin to allow people to trade it through its Cash mobile payments app. As a result, adjusted revenue from bitcoin was just $200,000. Square's mobile payment app is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo and is getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, according to Nomura Instinet. Dorsey has been notoriously bullish on bitcoin's role in the future of payments, and told the Sunday times newspaper in March he expects bitcoin to become the single global currency within the next decade. Dorsey is a personal investor in bitcoin and said he expects the digital currency to be used for simple things like coffee. The CEO predicted a 10-year timeline \"but it could go faster,\" the U.K.-based paper reported. Others, including Stanley Druckenmiller, have been skeptical about a practical use for bitcoin. He told CNBC in December that he doesn't hold bitcoin and it won't work as currency \"because you can't do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility.\" Bitcoin has fallen roughly 40 percent this year, and was trading near $8,260 Wednesday.

The behavior of the Australian dollar is one of those contradictions. On the one hand the Australian market is making new 10 year highs. This is generally taken as a sign of economic strength. Its particularly important for Australia where the market has been trapped in a prolonged sideways movement for more than a year while the rest of the world in the US and Asia have been streaking ahead. On the other hand, the Australian dollar has broken a long term uptrend and is rapidly moving towards 12-month, and potentially, two-year lows. The Australian Reserve bank is celebrating because they have been aiming for a lower dollar as a matter of principle. The last time the Australian market was trading near the current highs, the Aussie was trading at $0.81 rather than heading for a low of $0.715. The last time the AUD traded around $0.715 the Australian index was at a low near 4750. This is the contradiction \u2014 the falling Australian dollar and the Australian market making new 10-year highs. Interesting, but irrelevant, or significant? The answer lies in the speed of both moves. Once the AUD uptrend line was broken near $0.765 it has taken less than 3 weeks to touch $0.74. The AUD chart is defined by trading bands. The lower edge of the trading band is near $0.74. The upper edge near $0.775. The breakout above $0.775 had a target near $0.81. This was achieved. A fall below $0.74 has a downside target near $0.715. This is calculated by taking the width of the trading band and projecting it downwards. The speed of the rally in the Australian Index is equally astounding. In six weeks it has rallied from near 5750 to 6150. This is a very fast market rally and rallies of this nature are unsustainable. This is an exceptionally fast flow of money into the market and a good example of irrational exuberance as there are limited sound fundamentals to support this confidence. The trajectory of the Aussie dollar suggests the way this contradiction may be resolved with the Aussie market moving back into sync with the Aussie dollar. That's not to say we are looking at a trend change, but traders are alert for evidence of consolidation and a pullback in the Australian market particularly if the Aussie dollar fails to hold support near $0.74.

Grogan | CNBC Ray Dalio Successful hedge fund managers should do something unusual if they want to stay that way: Say no to new investors. The bigger a hedge fund gets, the worst it tends to perform, according to a new academic study. Holding other features constant, a 10 percent increase in fund size results\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad in a decrease of 13 basis points per month (or 1.53 percent per year) in raw returns on average and a decrease of 10 basis points per month (or 1.21 percent per year) in style-adjusted returns, according to the paper from Purdue University. \"A key implication of our findings for investors is that performance persistence is achievable when funds maintain a small size,\" researchers Chao Gao, Tim Haight and Chengdong Yin wrote. \"Fund performance declines with fund age and that declining performance is not significantly related to a variety of fund and family-level characteristics, nor is it significantly related to young funds assuming higher downside risk.\" The paper clarifies prior literature that found that hedge fund performance peaks during the first few years of a fund's life, but declines thereafter at an average rate of 42 basis points per year. The decline in performance, according to the Purdue researchers, appears to be due to managers taking their eye of the ball and focusing more on asset gathering (and the steady fees that come with them) rather than investing. Other studies hold that historical compensation contracts in the hedge fund industry, such as 2 percent management and 20 percent performance fees, is not effective at aligning managers' incentives with investors' interests. Yin's 2016 study, for example, demonstrates that the management fee comprises a larger portion of total compensation when funds grow large and thus a fund's optimal size, from a compensation perspective, exceeds the size that is optimal for performance. The research comes amid an ongoing move by funds to offer more competitive fee structures amid lackluster performance, declining revenues and rapidly evaporating investor patience. \"When funds grow large, fund managers may have less incentive to improve fund performance because most of their compensation comes from the asset-based management fee,\" the researchers concluded. \"Thus, investing in small funds, regardless of age, may provide for superior and sustainable returns.\" ", "author": "David A.

Real estate, the stock market and bitcoin are for amateurs. If you're looking to make some serious money, the kind that requires you to hire bodyguards and buy your own Brinks truck, you need an NFL franchise. The Carolina Panthers are getting a new owner, and David Tepper is set to pay a record $2.2 billion for the privilege. A jaw-dropping number, to be sure, given that Jerry Richardson paid $206 million for the rights to the expansion team in 1993. What makes the Panthers' sale price truly staggering, however, is that it's nearly a billion more than what Terry and Kim Pegula paid for the Buffalo Bills less than four years ago. More from USA Today: David Tepper expected to buy Panthers for $2.2 billion Five things to know about Panthers' likely buyer 2018 NBA draft lottery: Suns, Kings, Hawks land top three picks Granted, the Bills are the least-valuable of the 32 NFL teams, according to Forbes' 2017 valuations. But that alone can't explain the exorbitant jump in price. These are the Panthers that Tepper is buying, not the Patriots. For months now, the critics and naysayers have been sounding the alarm on the NFL. TV ratings are cratering! Fans have turned their backs on the league because of player protests during the national anthem! But what Tepper's purchase shows is that the NFL remains America's undisputed king. Owning a franchise is as close to a guaranteed moneymaker as there is. \"NFL franchises are enormously valuable,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College. \"If you gave me a choice, would I rather own a mid-table Major League Baseball team, a mid-table NBA team, a mid-table NHL team or a mid-table NFL team, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd take the NFL team.\" It's not hard to see why. While it's true the league's ratings have softened \u2013 as have those of pretty much everything on TV thanks to cord cutting \u2013 the NFL remains, by far, the most popular show going. NFL games accounted for the five most-watched TV shows last year and six of the top 10, according to Nielsen. The Super Bowl drew more than 111 million viewers, more than the four-highest non-NFL shows combined. The opening round of last month's draft on ESPN, Fox and NFL Network drew 11.2 million viewers. That's right. The draft. More than 11 million people tuned in for a show that featured about 60 seconds of \"action\" every 10 minutes or so. Those kind of numbers mean broadcasters and digital companies are still tripping over themselves for a piece of the NFL's action. Fox agreed earlier this year to pay the NFL $3.3 billion over five years just for the rights to Thursday Night Football. In December, Verizon agreed to pay $2 billion for five years' worth of streaming rights. Zimbalist did say he thinks the NFL's growth has flattened, and that the league faces challenges in the future because of concerns over head trauma. Right now, though, the biggest challenge appears to be what to do with all the cash the owners are getting. Baseball and the NBA have had some blockbuster sales. The Los Angeles Clippers sold for $2 billion four years ago and the Houston Rockets went for $2.2 billion last fall. The Los Angeles Dodgers commanded $2 billion in 2012 \u2013 but that included the team, Dodger Stadium and, perhaps most importantly, land around it. But those were exceptions, not the norm. Not so the NFL. The Panthers make three consecutive NFL teams to be sold for $1 billion or more, and none of them \u2013 Panthers, Bills or Cleveland Browns \u2013 would be considered one of the league's marquee franchises. If the Browns can command $1 billion, imagine what the Dallas Cowboys would go for on the open market. Or one of the New York teams. And we haven't even factored legalized sports betting into the equation yet. Imagine what Tepper would have had to pay had Richardson waited a week or two to finalize the deal. $2.5 billion? $3 billion? No doubt we'll soon find out. The Tennessee Titans, Denver Broncos and New Orleans Saints are considered the teams most likely to be on the block next, and the initial asking price just got higher. The NFL has its flaws, no question. Making its wealthy owners even wealthier is not one of them.

Bitcoin cash, a bitcoin offshoot, split off from bitcoin last year after a small group of developers decided to add upgrades that would improve transaction efficiency. The original Bitcoin is being referred to as Bitcoin core to differentiate it from the other version. But Ver, who is sometimes called \"Bitcoin Jesus\" because he was one of the first investors of bitcoin, said the Bitcoin core software is \"slow, expensive and unreliable.\" Instead, he recommended bitcoin cash, which he said, is built specifically for transactions. Ver said new innovation and infrastructures are being built on top of bitcoin cash, \"because it actually works.\" \"All of these existing businesses are building their new products on top of bitcoin cash, just like myself as the CEO of bitcoin.com,\" Ver said on \"Fast Money\" Tuesday. His website helps investors buy and store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \"The economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that led to bitcoin's original success,\" Ver said. \"I'm incredibly bullish on bitcoin cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on bitcoin back in 2011.\" On Tuesday, bitcoin cash created a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits. The software update immediately caused bitcoin cash's value to fall by about 5 percent. Still, at just above $1,300 Tuesday evening 6 p.m. ET, bitcoin cash is almost double its April 17 level of $763, when BKCM investment firm founder and CEO Brian Kelly predicted the coin would make a comeback later in the year. Bitcoin cash was also the best performing large-cap cryptocurrency in the last month, beating out other large-cap digital coins like ethereum, ripple and traditional bitcoin. Ver wasn't worried about Tuesday's sudden decline and even predicted bitcoin cash would double by the end of the year. \"That's what actually gives [bitcoin cash] its underlying value, that you can use it in commerce to pay for things. Whereas, a lot of these other tokens out there just kind of turn into speculative assets that don't actually have any utility.\" \"It's happening fast and furious around the world,\" he said. \"Bitcoin cash works as money; bitcoin core, sadly, no longer does.\" WATCH: Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? show chapters Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? 9:27 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 05:22 Disclaimer ", "author": "Roger Ver ", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/why-bitcoin-jesus-is-so-bullish-about-bitcoin-cash.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Roger Ver", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin Jesus", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "6:10 PM ET Tue", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "15", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "09:42 Cryptocurrency", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Roger Ver", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ver", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ver", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ver", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Fast Money", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Ver", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "2011", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "32", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "MB", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "just above $1,300", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "evening", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "6 p.m. ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "April 17", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "763", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "BKCM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Brian Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "about Tuesday's", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the end of the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "9:27 AM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "26 Oct 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Disclaimer", "category": "GPE"}], "description": "Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, aka \"Bitcoin Jesus,\" says bitcoin cash is faster and more reliable than the original bitcoin core.

Since early 2016, Square Cash app downloads have averaged 128 percent year-over-year growth each month versus Venmo's 74 percent, according to a Nomura analysis. With roughly 28 million cumulative downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads is just 1 million below Venmo's levels, analyst Dan Dolev said. \"Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017,\" Dolev said in a note to clients Wednesday, reiterating his buy rating on the stock. The app appears to be getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, the analyst noted. \"With Square Cash App now open for Bitcoin trading in most states, comparing its growth versus the popular Coinbase app is noteworthy,\" he added. \"Here, while Coinbase saw growth peak around the holiday time \u2014 as Bitcoin prices spiked \u2014 Coinbase's growth has slowed from record levels, whereas Square Cash App experienced more balanced growth.\" Dolev has consistently lauded Square Cash as a potential revenue driver for the payment company. His 12-month stock price target of $65 implies more than 18 percent upside over the next year. Though Square said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter, it initially spent $33.9 million to purchase the cryptocurrency, netting a final adjusted revenue of just $200,000.

Getty Images The city, long an oasis of good government and transparent finance in a region that often struggles with corruption and illicit money dealings, is well aware of its reputation and wants to keep it. In a report released at the end of April, Hong Kong rates its ability to fight dirty money flows as \"medium-high,\" citing its strong legal system, political commitment to the issue, and cooperation between the public and private sectors. But the very strengths that give the city economic dynamism \u2014 such as openness to financial flows and the sheer size of the banking system \u2014 can also be weaknesses. \"We are alert to the fact that Hong Kong's competitive advantages \u2026 could also make it attractive for criminals seeking to hide or move funds.\" -Paul Chan, financial secretary, Hong Kong The government's Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report rated Hong Kong's overall money laundering risk, threat and vulnerability as \"medium-high,\" though it said the banking sector specifically faces a \"high\" risk. \"We are alert to the fact that Hong Kong's competitive advantages \u2026 could also make it attractive for criminals seeking to hide or move funds,\" Paul Chan, financial secretary of Hong Kong, said in the report. show chapters Current situation on anti-money laundering isn\u2019t satisfactory: ECB 9:40 AM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 03:13 Illustrating the importance of finance to Hong Kong, nearly 200 banking institutions had assets of HK$22.7 trillion ($2.89 trillion) at the end of 2017 \u2014 an amount almost equivalent to nine times the size of its economy, according to the assessment. Keith Williamson, managing director and head of disputes and investigations in Hong Kong and China for turnaround firm Alvarez & Marsal, said that authorities must balance the need for openness and accessibility with regulation that's tight enough to deter money launderers. \"It's a difficult balancing act to perform,\" Williamson, an expert in forensic and investigative accounting, told CNBC. So-called suspicious transaction reports have nearly tripled in the five years to 2017, partly due to stepped-up monitoring and better compliance since the 2012 implementation of a local ordinance against money laundering and terrorist financing. Money launderers change their game The report described coping with the increase as a \"challenge.\" Analysts agree the system is under strain.

Once you press down on one side of the carpet the air bubble moves to the other.\" -Angus Young, senior lecturer, Hong Kong Baptist University But Hong Kong suffers from a lack of qualified specialists, especially at non-banks such as local securities firms as well as at regulators, who are capable of analyzing complex transactions amid the toughened compliance and risk requirements, Young said. That combined with general weaknesses in compliance and training leaves Hong Kong in a \"vulnerable\" state overall, he said. \"What I feel is that it underrepresents the true possibility of financial crimes, especially in anti-money laundering,\" he said of the government's assessment.

The United States has in recent years pushed for a stronger global regime against money laundering and terror financing and has used sanctions and penalties to spread the message, Williamson said, which has caused governments to beef up their financial defenses. \"So I don't think it's just a local reaction to the challenges that there are here,\" he said of Hong Kong's stance. \"It's clearly in line as well with an increased regulatory regime around this globally.'

But Peter Costa, a governor at the New York Stock Exchange, said this is not the beginning of a bear market. \"You'll never see a bear market start with the Russell 2000 hitting an all-time high,\" Costa, president of NYSE trading firm Empire Executions, said on \"Closing Bell\" Thursday. \"It's never happened.

Another sign of the strong economy is the yield curve, said John Burke, owner and manager of Burke Financial. He pointed out that so far in May the yield curve, or the spread between long- and short-term interest rates, has increased. \"The stock market has never come to a halt when the yield curve is getting steeper,\" Burke said on \"Closing Bell.\" Still, Thursday's trading session was a disappointing one for market watchers. All three major indexes closed lower. Some investors fear continued trade tensions may be the culprit. But Barbara Doran, director and senior portfolio manager at Yorkbridge Wealth Partners, disagreed. \"We're used to getting a lot of noise on the trade talks,\" she said on \"Closing Bell.\" Costa said the most likely outcome of the trade talks is \"some sort of compromise.\" \"There are advisors that are going to be a lot more vocal and [telling Trump], 'Look, this could be extremely detrimental, not only to the Chinese economy but to the U.S. economy and the world economy,'\" Costa said. Still, Burke said investors, including his firm, are \"most worried about\" political factors influencing the market. \"It's not just China.

This Thursday, the Verkhovna Rada (the parliament of Ukraine) is expected to consider a historic proposal to replace 25-year-old foreign exchange legislation with an entirely new law that will open our country to international investors and make it easier for Ukrainian businesses to operate globally. Technical though it may seem, liberalization of our arcane foreign exchange controls will make Ukraine a much more investor-friendly place and will help the country take its rightful spot amongst the major European and global economies. For nearly four years now, we at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) have been working to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and create a solid foundation for economic growth in Ukraine and prosperity for all who live and work here. We have come a long way during that time. My new post-revolutionary team took over the National Bank in 2014, finding ourselves in an incredibly difficult context. Ukraine was not only experiencing military aggression from Russia in the East, but the profound economic turmoil that coincided with it \u2014 since, our team at the National Bank have worked tirelessly to stabilize the situation and tame inflation. Today, the banking system is in better shape than it ever has been in the history of independent Ukraine thanks to the clean-up and reforms implemented since 2014. All of the obligations that the National Bank took on under the last IMF (International Monetary Fund) memorandum have been fulfilled. External markets are also favorable for Ukraine as economies of our trade partners are recovering and commodity prices are high. We must maintain this momentum, make life better for businesses and support investment. The time has come for large-scale foreign exchange liberalization. The proposed law moves us toward that goal. To say it is overdue would be an understatement. The key legislation setting out our current currency control rules is a full 25 years old and it has not aged well. In the 1990s when Ukraine was struggling to tackle the Soviet legacy, set its economy on market rails and control capital outflows, highly restrictive rules on foreign currency transactions made sense. Today they are out of place and are holding back growth. Out of Ukraine's patchwork of foreign exchange laws, about 70 percent of the rules are about prohibiting or restricting things. This means administrative burden, delays and complications for Ukrainian businesses trading with overseas partners, foreign investors repatriating their investment or dividends, for Ukrainian freelancers doing work for overseas clients and many others. The regulatory system we have had in place for the last quarter of a century no longer reflects the business environment in Ukraine. Our highly qualified, multilingual workforce and our innovative approach to development has seen an ever-increasing amount of interest from foreign investors looking to set up in or outsource operations to Europe. Our tech sector is but one example: a thriving industry worth around $5 billion. We boast the largest number of IT professionals in Europe and play host to numerous multinational brands including Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Boeing, eBay, Siemens, IBM and Huawei, who all have research and development centers here. show chapters Trump: Companies see a 'tremendous potential' in the Ukraine 10:42 AM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 | 05:41 Our start-up environment too, is leading the way for our European peers. A number of high profile software start-ups, including the now-famous writing app Grammarly, have gone global and are used by millions every day. It is a lucrative sector: One of the most notable start-up deals we've seen came from Ukrainian-born augmented photography start-up Looksery, who was acquired by Snapchat for $150 million. When the draft law developed by my team, entitled \"Currency Law,\" is approved by parliament we can expect more and more success stories to come forward. The law will move Ukraine's foreign exchange regulation from a position of \"if it's not expressly allowed, it's forbidden\" to \"if it's not expressly forbidden, it's allowed\" \u2014 a much more helpful stance for our banks and businesses looking to operate internationally. Households back home will benefit too as more jobs are created. This reform will be some of the best news for business to come out of Ukraine this year. It will help give investors into Ukraine peace of mind and minimal administrative burden when it comes to doing deals or repatriating profits. As the ease of doing business continues to increase, so too will our country's ability to secure the investment we need. Looking at the big picture, this is Ukraine opening up to the world and taking a step forward on the (long) road of its EU integration ambitions. European Commission experts were involved in developing the new law and it takes inspiration from relevant EU Council regulations. This law is about the free movement of capital, which is crucial for well-functioning economies in today's world. That goal is always in sight for us. To achieve greater integration into the European economy, and our place globally, we must operate at the same level as our European counterparts. This means transparent operations and investor-friendly policy required to work together with international businesses. In addition, it means financial stability, as the \"Currency Law\" provides the National Bank with power and tools to prevent and get over the crises whatever origin and development they have. That is another reason why the draft law received the support of the International Monetary Fund. We, the National Bank of Ukraine and myself as its new governor, have a unique opportunity to help secure sustainable growth and prosperity for generations of Ukrainians \u2014 Ukraine has much to offer the world, and it is the NBU's job to make sure that everyone can benefit. \u2014Yakiv Smolii is the governor of the National Bank of Ukraine.

Certain stocks have track records of strong returns when rates rise. The yield broke above 3.1 percent on Wednesday for the first time since 2011.

Those three stocks returned at least 12.1 percent on average during three-month periods when rates were surging, according to data from Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool. Apple and J.P. Morgan Chase are also big winners when rates jump, averaging returns of 11.8 percent and 10.9 percent in three months, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, averages returns of 4.8 percent. (The CNBC Kensho search used the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF as a proxy for the bond market. The search looked at periods of time when this ETF fell more than 5 percent in three months. Since bond prices move inversely to bond yields, this would correlate with an environment of rising rates.) Meanwhile, General Electric and Walmart are among the Dow stocks that are the biggest laggards when rates jump. GE averages a loss of 1 percent during three-month periods of rising rates, Kensho data show, while Walmart averages a slight return of 0.3 percent.

CBS and Viacom have not been able to come to terms on some aspects of their merger and CBS is fighting what it calls interference by the Redstone family. \"They can get a lot more value from other players than this kind of forced marriage that's being contemplated here,\" said Crockett, senior analyst at B.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images CBS wants to cut National Amusement's voting power through a special dividend to shareholders. Its board scheduled a meeting to consider the dividend for later Thursday and confirmed that meeting would take place as planned despite the ruling. Crockett believes CBS is doing everything it can to protect the interests of its shareholders that don't have a majority of the vote. As for who may be a better match for CBS, Crockett told \"Power Lunch\" one potential partner could be Verizon. According to Reuters, Verizon had shown an interest in CBS. He said if the AT&T-Time Warner deal goes through, Verizon may want to think about that again. There is also a lot of interest among internet companies to get deeper into content, he added. \"If AT&T and Time Warner beat off the DOJ's antitrust suit there's going to be a lot more, I think, reasons to think about marriages of internet platforms with content and being able to use that combination to innovate in advertising and get scale with consumer data,\" said Crockett.

Paul Hickey, who runs independent research firm Bespoke Investment Group, says WTI crude is surging in an atmosphere that isn't normally conducive for such big gains. \"We've seen a real big rally in crude oil here off the lows,\" Hickey said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"The dollar over that same period is up about 5 percent, and as you know, like oil and water, oil and the dollar typically don't mix.\" Yet, crude has still managed to rally nearly 15 percent over the past six weeks. Hickey calls it an \"impressive trend\" in an inhospitable environment. But that doesn't mean it hasn't happened before. \"When we looked back at these prior periods in the market when you see these simultaneous rallies, crude oil has had a little bit better-than-average returns. The energy stocks have done really well going forward as well as the overall stock market,\" Hickey said. He highlights the S&P 500 energy index as an area giving Wall Street strong profits. \"It's one of the most extended sectors in the short term, further above its 50-day moving average than any other group. And, it's closer to a 52-week high than any other sector,\" he said. But according to Hickey, that doesn't imply oil prices have become too expensive and will stall. \"If you look at the relative strength of the energy sector going back to 1980, it's still very depressed and right near 14-year lows,\" Hickey said. \"Longer term, energy has got a very deep hole to dig itself out of.\" Crude oil hit an oil time high of $147.27 a barrel on July 11, 2008. WTI is trading in the low $70s. European Brent crude briefly broke $80 a barrel on Thursday for the first time in 3\u00bd years. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

US companies from JPMorgan Chase to eBay have come under fire from shareholder groups for trying to neuter a burgeoning campaign to strengthen investor oversight of management. A corporate governance movement to make it easier for shareholders to call special meetings, by lowering the required level of investor support, has gathered momentum in the past year. But companies have begun fighting back with what campaigners say amounts to a spoiler tactic designed to thwart their efforts. JPMorgan won support for the status quo in a contentious vote earlier this week, and the issue is set for another showdown at eBay later this month. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The ability of shareholders to call special meetings is a powerful weapon for investors who want to oust directors or force other changes at listed companies outside of the regular schedule of annual meetings. While the right is exercised only rarely, campaigners say the mere threat can be enough to pressure companies to respond to investor demands. Examples include Allergan, where activist Bill Ackman demanded such a meeting during a hostile takeover battle. Shareholders have filed formal proposals to make it easier to call special meetings at a record 61 US-listed companies this year, according to the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions. Last year, 24 proposals were filed and attracted an unusually high average shareholder backing of 42 per cent. \"It's being watched closely,\" said Peter Kimball, head of advisory at ISS Corporate Solutions. At JPMorgan, Kenneth Steiner \u2014 one of the most prolific sponsors of shareholder proposals \u2014 called on the bank to accede to future demands for a special meeting if 10 per cent of shareholders wanted one. But the bank responded that \"a small minority of shareholders should not be entitled to utilise the mechanism of special meetings for their own interests\" and also that there were \"significant costs\" associated with such events. At its annual meeting in Texas this week, JPMorgan sought \"ratification\" of existing its rules, which require 20 per cent backing among shareholders before a special meeting can be held. By putting forward its own motion, the bank was able to omit Mr Steiner's proposal from the ballot. Similarly, the S&P 500 lender Capital One put forward a proposal at its annual meeting earlier this month to ratify its existing rules, omitting a shareholder motion to lower the threshold. The company said that its own proposal provided \"a more effective method to commence further engagement on the topic of special meetings, rather than a vote on the stockholder proposal\". By pushing more radical shareholder proposals off the ballot, companies are engaging in \"gamesmanship\", said Rosemary Lally of the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members have combined assets of more than $3.5tr. \"It's not a very democratic process when you do it that way.\" JPMorgan's management proposal received 58 per cent shareholder backing and Capital One's just over half \u2014 less support than is typical for management proposals but enough to pass. ISS had recommended shareholders vote against the proposals at both companies. \"We asked our shareholders about a threshold that is at or lower than 400 of the S&P 500 companies,\" a JPMorgan spokesman said. \"Our shareholders have spoken with their vote.\" eBay is seeking ratification for its existing 25 per cent threshold at its annual meeting in California on May 30. \"The company believes that this management proposal is an effective means to obtain stockholder viewpoints and engage with stockholders,\" it said. While shareholders have the right to quiz management at annual meetings, campaigners point to high profile corporate problems such as Wells Fargo's fake bank accounts scandal to argue that serious issues can emerge between the gatherings. \"They're just trying to thrown down a roadblock,\" said John Chevedden, another shareholder campaigner who has put forward proposals to lower the threshold for special meetings. \"Who's the company to say you can't vote for it this year?\" More from the Financial Times: May concedes on tie to customs union until Irish border resolved Young left out of US boom in housing wealth Dark factories: labour exploitation in Britain's garment industry ", "author": "Scott Mlyn | CNBC ", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/jpmorgan-and-ebay-under-fire-over-shareholder-meetings.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Scott Mlyn", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Pedestrians", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "JPMorgan Chase", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "JPMorgan Chase", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "eBay", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the past year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "earlier this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "eBay", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "later this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4 weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just $1", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Allergan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bill Ackman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "61", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "ISS Corporate Solutions", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "24", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "42 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Peter Kimball", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "ISS Corporate Solutions", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kenneth Steiner \u2014 one", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "10 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Texas", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Steiner", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Rosemary Lally of the Council of Institutional Investors", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "more than $3.5tr", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "58 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Capital One's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just over half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "lower than 400", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "eBay", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "25 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "California", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "May 30", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "John Chevedden", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Irish", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Young", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Dark", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Britain", "category": "GPE"}], "description": "Many US companies are under watchful eye after attempting to dilute a campaign gaining traction to strengthen investor oversight of management, the Financial Times reports.

Issuing additional debt could weigh on the company's credit profile, while supplying more stock or convertible bonds would dilute current shareholders. Tesla declined to comment for this story. Despite the forecast for additional capital requirements and a sell rating from Goldman, Musk insisted as recently as May 2 he has no intention of raising new money.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rose to its highest level since 2011 this week, while the two-year note yield trades at a level not seen in a decade. Investors have been selling Treasurys amid fears that rising inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market is expecting. \"Rates on risk-free cash assets (government bills and notes) in the U.S. have now risen to a record high against equivalent rates on euro-area debt.

For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 are up only 0.3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Last year, both indexes surged at least 19 percent. Darda added gold could be in danger, as the higher rates could spark a bear market for the precious metal. \"Although the relationship isn't perfect, rising real rates ... have been strongly inversely related to the level of gold prices over the last two decades.\" Gold prices have been under pressure this year, falling more than 1 percent in that time period.

Barry Zyskind, the chairman and CEO of the company, and George Karfunkel, one of its founders, together own 40.87 percent of the stock and have been pursuing a plan to take AmTrust private, a deal which Icahn said he opposes. \"You have structured your take-over to ensure that the transaction is reviewed under the lower, more deferential 'business judgment' standard, as opposed to the enhanced, more stringent 'entire fairness' standard,\" the investor said in a letter. Icahn also said the company's board set April 5 as the date of record for shareholders to vote in a June 4 meeting, without letting shareholders or the market know. He called for the board to change the record date and special meeting immediately. AmTrust did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report. ", "author": "David A.

In a review of 1,450 digital coin offerings, the Journal said it found that 271 bore red flags such as plagiarized documents or fake executive information. Investors have already claimed losses of up to $273 million in these projects, the newspaper said, according to lawsuits and regulatory actions. The coin sales, or \"initial coin offerings,\" give investors the chance to buy into a new digital token while letting developers get easy access to funding. The process may be a little too easy for many projects that are unproven or outright scams. Coin offerings have raised roughly $9.8 billion in the two years through mid-March, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. The Journal found widespread plagiarism in 111 projects' online whitepapers, including word-for-word copies of marketing plans and technical features. The demand is so high that freelancers will write the papers for $100 or more, the report said. Lifting images and names to create the appearance of a reputable development team is also not uncommon. One Polish banker named Jenish Mirani found that his profile picture was used by online payment project Denaro to portray its co-founder \"Jeremy Boker,\" the Journal said. The paper said no one responded to its attempts to reach the company. Many initial coin offerings officially prohibit U.S. citizens and residents from participating, out of fear of regulatory crackdown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has frozen assets and charged founders with fraud in several cases of cryptocurrency scams. On Wednesday, the SEC also launched a website called \"HoweyCoins.com\" to show investors what a fraudulent coin offering might look like online. Read the full WSJ story here.

Ousted leader Najib Razak had introduced the tax in 2015 amid lower oil prices.

Expenditure reduction will begin with rationalisation and efficiency measures and reducing leakages,\" the statement said. It did not say when the sales tax will be introduced. Brian Tan, a Singapore-based economist with Nomura, said the timing of SST implementation was a concern. \"It is a question of how quickly you can bring (the SST)back. In the intervening period of the removal of GST and the return of SST, there is obviously going to be a gap in revenue. The question is how long and large will that gap be,\" he said.

That's double the valuation it was reported to be looking to fetch with a listing on the Nasdaq in Stockholm later this year. What is iZettle? IZettle is a rival to Square, the U.S. fintech firm led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, but only competes directly with the $21 billion company in the U.K. The company makes small, wireless chip readers along with a number of other payment processing products. It recently launched a new product that lets small businesses build their own online stores. The acquisition means that iZettle will no longer be seeking a listing of its own, something it \"spent roughly a year\" trying to achieve, according to Jacob de Geer, the firm's chief executive. \"I think it's important to clarify that since we started the company in 2010 we've been doing a lot of work with PayPal and the team at various capacities in terms of cooperation and partnerships,\" De Geer said in a phone interview with CNBC on Friday. Johan Jeppsson | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"We've been struggling all along to get to the vision we're aiming for in terms of helping small businesses and competing with the giants, and PayPal has in the area of 20 million merchants whereas iZettle has 500,000,\" he added. The company has so far failed to make a profit, but has said it wants to achieve positive consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2020. De Geer said at the time of iZettle's IPO announcement that it would look to draw in some slightly larger merchants. Why did PayPal buy iZettle? For PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready, the move is about increasing its payments presence among physical retailers. \"This phenomenon of in-store payments via mobile for small businesses, it's a global phenomenon and there have been many players in the space,\" Ready told CNBC. \"Most of them though have been constrained to one or only a few countries.\" IZettle is currently present in 12 countries in Europe and Latin America, while PayPal operates in more than 200. Ready said that, following the deal, PayPal would look to expand iZettle's international presence further. \"What I think is quite distinctive about this team is their ability to go serve small businesses on a multinational basis,\" he said. Eric Piermont | AFP | Getty Images PayPal, a company worth almost $94 billion, is used by major retailers around the world, including Walmart and Best Buy. IZettle's focus, on the other hand, is more on small-to-medium-sized firms. E-commerce giant eBay dealt PayPal a blow earlier this year when it decided it would drop PayPal as its primary payments provider. The online shopping site chose a European start-up of its own, Adyen, to replace PayPal. Adyen is also reportedly seeking to list its shares. PayPal's Ready said that the investment in iZettle would give PayPal more of a \"technical\" presence in Europe. \"Europe contains many of our most important markets, we have huge presence in Europe already from a commercial perspective,\" he said. \"But one of the things that we think is fantastic is that his is going to create a European center of excellence for us on a technical perspective.\" He added: \"We'll now have an amazing team of engineers and product development and builders here in Stockholm to increase our presence in Europe from a technical perspective and help us build out many more capabilities.\" ", "author": "Johan Jeppsson | Bloomberg via Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/why-paypal-bought-izettle-for-2-point-2-billion.html", "keywords": [{"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "nearly $2.2 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "9:50 AM ET Fri", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "18", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Stockholm", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Sweden", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "iZettle", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "$2.2 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Nasdaq", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Stockholm", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "later this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "iZettle", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Square", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Jack Dorsey", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$21 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "roughly a year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Jacob de Geer", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "2010", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "De Geer", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Johan Jeppsson", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "iZettle", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2020", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "De Geer", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "iZettle's", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bill Ready", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Latin America", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 200", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "iZettle", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Eric Piermont", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "AFP", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Getty Images PayPal", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "almost $94 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Walmart", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Best Buy", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "eBay", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Adyen", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Adyen", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ready", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "iZettle", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Stockholm", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}], "description": "PayPal's acquisition means iZettle will no longer be seeking a listing of its own, something it \"spent roughly a year\" trying to achieve.", "title": "Why PayPal bought a European start-up with IPO plans for $2.2 billion", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/12/104894189-GettyImages-485522548_1.jpg?v=1513100173"}, {"time": "2018-05-21T07:53:09-0400", "body": " Getty Images Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella walks in front of the Cortana logo.

This means taking information received by AI and applying it to future dialogue. The firm's speech recognition team previously led automatic speech recognition development for Apple's personal assistant Siri. In its announcement Monday, Microsoft did not disclose any financial details of the acquisition. Big players are trying to make their personal assistants more human-like. Amazon has said it is aiming to give Alexa a \"memory\" and add more context to conversations, while Google demonstrated a chat between a hairdresser and a human-like version of its assistant that booked an appointment on behalf of someone else. \"With the acquisition of Semantic Machines, we will establish a conversational AI center of excellence in Berkeley to push forward the boundaries of what is possible in language interfaces,\" David Ku, chief technology officer at Microsoft AI and Research, said in a blog post. \"Combining Semantic Machines' technology with Microsoft's own AI advances, we aim to deliver powerful, natural and more productive user experiences that will take conversational computing to a new level.\" AI-powered personal assistants are core to voice-activated speakers like Amazon's Echo and Google's Home.

The phone is part of Michel's digital platform Blacture, which was announced in a 2018 Super Bowl ad, and celebrates black culture through content and technology. The first retail move for Blacture is the launch of Motif, a $300 smartphone that hits stores this fall. \"When you use the phone you'll get paid and you can convert it into cash,\" Michel told CNBC'S \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"Blockchain is the technology.\" Michel said Motif users will earn a percentage on every purchase when they pay using their phone, which unlike airline miles can be redeemed for cash. The phone can also be linked to a Blacture debit card. Motif partnered with tech company Zippie, and Michel said the group is in talks with the top four U.S. phone carriers. Michel founded the Fugees with Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill, and the group went on to win two Grammys for \"Killing Me Softly\" in 1996. The rapper wouldn't say whether or not he owns any cryptocurrency. But Michel knew about it well before bitcoin's meteoric rise to $20,000 last year. \"A friend of mine introduced bitcoin to me when it was at 11 cents,\" he said. \"I didn't believe in it then.\" Bitcoin was the first use-case for blockchain but advocates say the technology has the power to disrupt industries from health care to the music business. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded on what's known as a \"distributed ledger,\" which can be accessed but not altered by the public.

Bitcoin hit a high of $8,835 last week before blockchain enthusiasts flocked to New York. The cryptocurrency has dropped more than 40 percent this year. Bitcoin's one-week performance Source: CoinDesk \"While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on crypto-currencies strengthened during the conference,\" said Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, who is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. Lee even went as far as to say Friday on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" that Consensus was a \"huge success.\" \"It's a great conference to bring a lot of people together from around the world. And I think the quality of the people that were there,\" Lee told CNBC. \"It's amazing.\" \"It's the people that you know are important to this industry coming together,\" he said. \"But also a lot of decision-makers incremental.\" Lee called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' declines, \"growing pains,\" and pointed that that the conference has more than tripled in attendance since last year. In fact, this year's Consensus conference drew in more than 8,500 attendees, according to Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of parent company Digital Currency Group. CoinDesk reported 2,700 attendees for the May 2017 conference. At roughly $2,000 a ticket, the conference raked in at least $17 million in ticket sales alone. Kate Rooney | CNBC Many attendees had to wait more than an hour to register at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus 2018 conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. More than 20 other events happened as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Among the private, post-conference festivities: Snoop Dogg performed in the West Village for crypto start-up Ripple, and a new venture called rented out the 210-foot party yacht \"Cornucopia Majesty.\" Z-cash is one of the the only major cryptocurrencies to rally this week after trading platform Gemini announced it would list the coin on its licensed exchange. Other major cryptocurrencies struggled this week. Since Monday, ethereum has fallen roughly 9 percent, bitcoin cash is down 22 percent, and litecoin and XRP have both dropped 12 percent.

Shares of Applied Materials fell sharply Friday after the company lowered its current-quarter revenue and sales projections in its semiconductor business below Wall Street expectations. At one point, shares of the company, one of the globe's largest supplier of tools used by chipmakers, tumbled more than 9.5 percent Friday, on track for its worst day since February 2009. By early afternoon, it was down 8.2 percent. Its disappointing forecast only fueled investor anxiety that a plateauing smartphone market could finally curb demand for flash memory chips. \"Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models. And in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning,\" CEO Gary Dickerson told investors on Thursday's earnings call. show chapters Can chip stocks make a comeback? 12:02 PM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 05:37 Applied Materials said it expects semiconductor sales revenue to grow 7 percent in the current quarter, well short of the 13.8 percent boost expected by the Street, according to FactSet. As a barometer for the rest of the industry, Applied Materials' top customers include other large multinational companies like Samsung Electronics, Micron and Intel. Micron and Intel shares also fell Friday. The disappointing guidance drew critical comments from Goldman Sachs analysts, who downgraded the company's shares to neutral from buy on Friday. \"We downgrade Applied Materials from buy to neutral as we reduce our estimates and price target to reflect the underwhelming market share outlook in the core Semi Cap Equipment business, worse-than-feared fundamentals in Display, and a muted gross margin outlook,\" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote. Hari, who emphasized Goldman remains \"constructive\" on Applied Materials' competitive positioning, nonetheless cut the company's price target to $58 from $65, implying 7 percent upside over the next 12 months. Despite the lackluster guidance, Applied Materials did post second-quarter results that beat consensus expectations and offered upbeat comments looking forward for the business as a whole. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 versus expectations of $1.14, while revenue of $4.57 billion topped forecasts of $4.45 billion. \"The Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence will disrupt and transform virtually every industry and area of the economy over the next decade,\" Dickerson added in the earnings call. \"While we're only at the very beginning of the buildout of the AI big data era, we are already starting to see the positive impact on our markets.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Glazer, who manages more than $2.5 billion in assets, acknowledged that the April jobs report didn't signal rising inflation \u2014 but it still exists, he contended in an interview. \"Inconvenient truths include the fact that when you have that [a] plummeting unemployment rate and you add in the biggest tax stimulus in three decades, it's ultimately going to lead to higher wages and potentially inflation,\" the Mayflower Advisors managing partner told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" last week. Rising prices are \"lagging data. It will show up in the months ahead,\" Glazer added. He also noted the recent spike in crude oil prices are starting to filter through the economy, and will create inflationary pressures. Recent evidence suggests gas prices are on the rise ahead of Memorial Day. \"It will begin to affect consumers as the summer driving season kicks in,\" he added. 'Put that money to work' Due to the emerging scenario, Glazer is advising investors to limit mega cap stocks and big tech exposure \u2014 groups that had been rallying as inflation and interest rates were at historic lows. \"It's about re-positioning portfolios \u2014 recognizing the new paradigm,\" he said, advocating a more domestic approach to investing right now. He prefers small cap value, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), financials and energy. According to Glazer, they'll be the biggest beneficiaries of rising rates and an inflation comeback. If this environment feels feels too unsettled, he points out there's always cash. \"A 2 percent money market sounds really great. It's actually outperforming a lot of areas of the stock market,\" Glazer said. \"As you get a bout of volatility later in the year, you can re-position.

Nordstrom's stock plunged 7 percent in Friday's premarket after the company reported disappointing quarterly sales growth. The Seattle-based retailer said same-store sales \u2014 a key metric for retail companies \u2014 rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected an increase of 1.1 percent. Atlantic Equities analyst Daniela Nedialkova said in a note Friday the miss was driven by a weaker performance in Nordstrom's off-price business, which includes Nordstrom Rack. \"While this shortfall sparked the negative after-hours reaction, we see a positive in the continued acceleration of full-line. This is the second positive comp in a row from full-line, after a long period of negatives and a lack of consistency,\" Nedialkova said. The miss on same-store sales was enough to overshadow better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter. Nordstrom posted revenue of $3.56 billion and a profit of 51 cents per share. Nedialkova \u2014 who has an overweight rating on the stock and a price target of $58 \u2014 said the stock's decline represents a buying opportunity for investors.

Being there, it became clear why the humble stock market sage likes it so much: It doesn't go out of its way to make a splash. Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, drives around in a car he reportedly bought for less than $50,000. He also lives in the same house he bought for $31,500 in 1958. For breakfast, Buffett goes to McDonald's, where he spends no more than $3.17, and eats alone. In many ways, Gorat's strikes the same modest, low-key vibe as Buffett. Fred Imbert | CNBC Nothing inside Gorat's (except for the TV at the bar) looks too modern or feels brand new. The paintings on the walls and the furniture are not flashy, either. Everything is simple and to the point. It's as if you were transported back to a simpler time. Perhaps that's on purpose. The restaurant was renovated about six years ago when it changed owners. Gene Dunn, the person who bought Gorat's in 2012, told the Omaha World-Herald in 2013 they \"took it back to what it was in the 1940s and '50s\" by taking out all of the decor from the 1970s. That included the dropped ceilings and carpeting, among other things. Fred Imbert | CNBC A constant, however, has been the quality of the food. When I went, I had their Omaha sirloin steak, a 10-ounce piece of meat topped with bleu cheese butter coupled with a side of french fries and some greens. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly and the waitress serving my table was very nice (as most people in Omaha seemed to be). Other options include a 14-ounce New York strip, lamb chops and a 14-ounce ribeye. More ambitious diners can opt for the 22-ounce Omaha T-bone steak, Buffett's personal favorite. Three of the people sitting at my table ordered it and, even though they seemed to struggle with it, they managed to finish it. Buffett has been going to Gorat's for years and the restaurant is aware of his longstanding patronage. Buffett's face is seen throughout the restaurant in pictures and cardboard cutouts. He also has his own private dining area consisting of one table with three chairs. Fred Imbert | CNBC A cardboard cutout of Warren Buffett at Gorat's Steakhouse in Omaha, Nebraska Gorat's has been an institution in Omaha for more than 70 years. Once you go there, you can immediately tell why it's Buffett's favorite steakhouse (it also helps that the food and service are great).

In an interview with CNBC in Melbourne on Friday, he said: \"As a banker, I am ashamed.\" A Royal Commission inquiry had exposed the misconduct of bankers across the sector, including NAB. The bank told the Commission it identified more than 1,300 customers who may have been affected by the misconduct of dozens of its bankers. NAB has admitted to the inquiry that some of its advisers had engaged in dishonest and illegal conduct such as misappropriation of client funds. It has paid A$19 million in compensation to customers. It also said that for years it charged advisory fees to hundreds of thousands of clients without providing them with services or allocating them an adviser. In an open letter to customers and shareholders, Thorburn said that 20 bankers in New South Wales and Victoria have had their employment terminated, or are no longer with NAB as a result of its investigation. Thorburn conceded that bad behavior has no place in a bank. \"I also know (Australian Securities and Investment Commission James Shipton) talked about focusing more on and clamping down on bad behavior. And I agree totally with that because when we have bad behavior in a bank it's really destabilizing and debilitating.\" \"We need to find it, fix it, and hold people accountable. And we will continue to do that.\" However, the NAB boss defended the majority of his bankers \u2014 there are 12,000 versus the 20 who were involved, pointing out \"there's a lot of people here who are doing absolutely the right thing.\" \u2014 Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

The Cash app, which launched in 2015, is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo, according to Nomura Instinet.

Square filed for an FDIC licence to be an industrial loan company in Utah, American Banker first reported in September. The license would allow it to perform some of the same services as banks, including issuing loans without having rely on a bank to originate them, and without having to get licenses in each state. Square launched cryptocurrency trading through its Cash app in January, which Dolev said is another main reason the app has grown in popularity. Dorsey said on the conference panel Wednesday he's a \"huge fan\" of bitcoin and its underlying technology. Dorsey also said he wants Square to help its long-term adoption. \"The internet is going to have a native currency, so let's not wait for it to happen, let's help it happen,\" Dorsey said. \"I don't know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be.\" Shares of Square slipped as much as 3 percent this week after news that PayPal would pay $2.2 billion to buy iZettle, which provides mobile card readers.

Dell remains bullish on VMware's future and wants to own as much of the stock as possible, and also wants to clean up the virtualization pioneer's capital structure, which has been complicated by a series of mergers and partial spin-outs, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Dell Technologies released a filing Thursday saying it is still weighing an initial public offering, a merger with VMware or doing nothing. Dell added a fourth possible option -- \"a potential conversion of shares of Class V Common Stock of Dell into shares of DHI Common Stock of Dell.\" In other words, Dell is considering exchanging its common stock, which today is privately held by Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake, for shares of the publicly traded tracker, DVMT. To that end, Dell wants to suss out the thoughts of the DVMT tracker holders, which include hedge funds D.E. Shaw and Elliott Management, before it moves forward with any transaction, the people said. Dell wants to know whether these owners would prefer to hold complete shares of Dell, rather than shares of a stock that tracks only the performance of VMware within Dell. A DHI common share is an ownership stake in all of Dell, including EMC, the personal computer business, and Dell's ownership position in VMware. VMware has a complicated ownership structure. Currently, Dell owns 82 percent of VMware. Of that portion, 50 percent is held by owners of the tracking stock DVMT. The other 32 percent is held by founder Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake, the owners of Dell's DHI. Michael Dell and Silver Lake took Dell Technologies private in 2013 and later acquired EMC (which owned a big stake in VMware) in 2016. That $67 billion deal still stands as the largest pure technology acquisition ever. The remainder of VMware is traded publicly as VMW. Last month, activist investor Carl Icahn acquired a stake in VMware below the mandatory 5 percent threshold for disclosure, according to people familiar. Icahn attempted to thwart Michael Dell's 2013 effort to take Dell private. Dell is unlikely to pursue an exchange of DHI for DVMT if the holders of the tracking stock don't want to move forward with a VMware deal, one of the people said. Dell loves the VMware business and wants to own the entire company, the people said. A reverse merger where combined Dell-VMware shares trade publicly would also allow Silver Lake to monetize its investment of Dell on the public market. A deal that eliminates the tracker stock could simplify a VMware merger, as Dell could then negotiate a straight 1-for-1 exchange ratio with VMware holders. Dell doesn't need to legally give VMware holders a so-called \"majority of the minority\" vote on a deal, although it would prefer to include one, two of the people said. While VMware has a special committee working on its behalf to ensure a fair transaction, a majority of the minority vote is a \"nice-to-have, but not a must-have,\" one of the people said. Dell continues to work on a complex valuation process, where it must calculate a fair value for itself and the relative exchange values for the tracker stock and VMware shares.

Shares rose 3.7 percent on Thursday but were trading down Friday after the disclosure on the FTC's website on Wednesday. The approval allows Appaloosa to acquire more shares of Allergan, in which it already has a 1 percent stake of 3.7 million shares, according to FactSet's count.

At $593 million, Appaloosa is already well past that threshold, but the approval gives it flexibility if it decides it wants to become more than a passive investor. Tepper's Appaloosa has been making changes to its holdings, disclosing earlier this week it exited a 4.6 million share stake in Apple and a 1.98 million share stake in Comcast and added new stakes in Applied Materials and Wells Fargo. It started building its Allergan stake in 2015. Tepper is also in a $2.2 billion deal to buy the Carolina Panthers professional football team. A spokesman for Appaloosa said he had no comment on the Allergan approval. Allergan, the maker of Botox and Juvederm, began a strategic review of its business earlier this year, including possible sales of business units or a splitting up of the company.

Hedge fund manager David Tepper's reportedly record-breaking bid for the NFL's Carolina Panthers has left many wondering if the billionaire may see the franchise as a long-term investment play. The value of the average NFL franchise more than doubled in the decade from 2007 to 2017, climbing to $2.52 billion from $957 million, according to Forbes. And despite a long bull market in stocks, the S&P 500 has fallen short of doubling in value. It is up just 77 percent over the same time. Tepper's deal \u2013 which remains subject to NFL approval \u2013 is reportedly worth $2.2 billion, the most ever paid for a football franchise and dwarfing the $1.4 billion the Pegula family paid for the Buffalo Bills back in 2014. But while the deal represents a huge initial buyout, Tepper is likely betting on reliable returns. The Pegulas, for example, have seen the value of the Bills climb to $1.6 billion in just two years, netting $200 million more than their initial investment. But Tepper is also likely watching the industry as a whole as the way people enjoy football continues to evolve. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); One relatively recent prospect for football fanatics is the ability to watch games online, with Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all vying for an all-important rights contract in recent years. Last month, the NFL announced that it had reached an agreement to renew its exclusive partnership with Amazon Prime Video to deliver a live digital stream of \"Thursday Night Football.\" The battle for sports content has been heating up between the tech titans over the last few years. Facebook recently announced that it would exclusively stream 25 Major League Baseball games, while YouTube struck a deal with Los Angeles' Major League Soccer team. This is the second year Amazon has won a contract with the NFL, reportedly paying $50 million to stream the 10 Thursday night games last year. These burgeoning sources of revenue could prove the next step for the NFL in its quest to keep up with a younger audience. And that, in turn, could have been one of the reasons Tepper considered buying a sports franchise, according to CNBC contributor and Short Hills Capital Partners founder Stephen Weiss. \"There's always going to be a profit angle, a return on investment calculus,\" Weiss said. \"It still has to be profitable.\" Weiss, who's known Tepper and other owners of major sports franchises over the years, said that to assess viewership with the traditional measures may slowly be becoming an outdated model. \"You can't just go by viewership on the major networks, you have to go by other factors because you've got other avenues of revenue,\" Weiss added. \"You've got Amazon, you've got YouTube: That creates arguably even more of a bidding war as well as more ways to leverage the product.\" The Panthers deal also comes just after the Supreme Court's ruling allowing states to legalize sports gambling. While the NFL has long opposed legalized sports gambling, the allowance could potentially spell additional revenue sources. Commenting on the news this week, billionaire investor Mark Cuban said the decision is fantastic news for investors in the sports and gambling industries. \"I think everyone who owns a top four professional sports team just basically saw the value of their team double,\" the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks said in a \"Squawk Alley\" interview. \"It can finally become fun to go to a baseball game again.\" But while NFL continues on as the most lucrative league in the world, some Wall Street brokerages are growing concerned by a recent string of soft ratings and viewership reports. J.P. Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse both cited weaker ratings and viewership in notes to clients during the 2017-2018 season, explaining that the apparent decline in viewership could wind up affecting major broadcasters like Fox and ESPN. The weaker numbers were so concerning that Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh cut his earnings per share estimates on CBS for last year's third quarter. \"We expect third-quarter network advertising to decline 3 percent, driven by soft ratings for both the summer schedule and for the start of the NFL season,\" Sheikh wrote in October, only to be echoed by J.P. Morgan's Alexia Quadrani one month later. \"Ratings are down in 8 of 10 weeks this season,\" Quadrani wrote. \"We note that ratings picked up in 2016 starting in Week 10, which was the first post-Election Day slate of games.\" However, CBS ultimately posted mixed results for the third quarter 2017 and defended its partnership with the NFL in its earnings call. The NFL \"is still the best game in town,\" CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves said in November, echoing Fox Sports' Shanks. \"There's no better way for advertisers to reach a mass audience, and it still provides the best promotional platform to us to launch our new shows.\" Ultimately, the relatively soft viewership numbers in 2017 will likely do little to usurp the commanding leadership the NFL \u2013 and professional sports more broadly \u2013 has over the TV world. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); According to Nielsen data, seven of the 10 most popular live or single telecasts in 2017 through November were NFL events, with Super Bowl LI, the Super Bowl postgame, and the AFC Championship game claiming first, second and third place respectively. That trend is unlikely to end anytime soon, with the earliest 2018 numbers from Nielsen already showing the NFL at the top of the list yet again, likely adding comfort to Tepper in his bid for the Panthers. \"It's like owning a Picasso. There aren't many out there and they rarely come up for sale,\" said Joe Favorito, a Columbia University professor and strategic communications executive in New York. \"You can't find another business, no matter what you do, that if you just maintain it, it appreciates in value like this.\" The most recent surge in value, Favorito said, is likely due to the ruthless bidding war for media rights, driving up the league's massive annual haul. Though specific insights into the NFL's financial situation are limited, a financial disclosure by the Green Bay Packers \u2013 the only publicly owned franchise in major U.S. sports \u2013 revealed that the NFL distributed a record $7.8 billion to its 32 teams in 2016, according to Bloomberg. The sizable annual allowance \u2013 and its yearly increases \u2013 are a direct result of deals like that inked by Fox Sports in January. In exchange for the rights to broadcast the NFL's \"Thursday Night Football\" for the next five seasons, Fox will dole out $3 billion \u2013 or roughly $60 million per game \u2013 according to a Reuters source. That number is an increase from the $45 million per game CBS and Comcast's NBC were paying to broadcast rights during the last season, according to the source. \"You're talking about multi-year, multi-billion dollar media contracts,\" Favorito said. \"That's been the basis for teams that come in: There is a massive pool of assets for you to use.\" \"Every time there's a sale, a new bar is set.\" #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Disclosures: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

It's finally happening. More than 16 years after the World Trade Center tragedy, a major component of the rebuilt WTC site is getting ready to open. 3 World Trade Center will be opening in early June, with lead tenants including music streaming firm Spotify and advertising giant GroupM. It will join 1 and 4 World Trade Center, the other two major buildings on the site, along with 7 World Trade Center on Greenwich Street. The completion of this phase of the World Trade Center comes as the Financial District of New York is experiencing a renaissance. I was at the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11 tragedy and worked at the NYSE in the immediate years after. The Financial District was filled with vacancies and remained relatively sparsely populated in those years. And then, it began to change. \"It's a very different neighborhood than it was in 2001\u2014 it's very different than it was even five years ago,\" Jessica Lappin, president of Alliance for Downtown New York, told me. \"We still have financial firms, but what's been amazing is to see tech, media, advertising firms \u2014 companies like Spotify and Group M \u2014 move down here as well and really change the face of the workforce and the feel of the neighborhood.\" Today, the commercial vacancy rate is below 10 percent, thanks to the infusion of those tech, media and advertising firms like Omnicom Media. And many people now call it home: 61,000 people live in the Financial District, more than ever before, most of them young professionals. And there are tourists galore, so many you can barely walk down some streets. Nearly 14 million came downtown in 2017 to visit Wall Street and the 9/11 Memorial, an 8 percent increase from 2016. The hotel business is booming as well: there are 7,000 hotel rooms in 32 hotels downtown, with another 2,000 under construction. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub, known as the \"Oculus,\" was completed two years ago and serves 250,000 commuters a day. The formerly rundown Seaport District is bustling with new shops and businesses, including new restaurants by Jean-Georges Vongerichten and David Chang. Live Nation is opening a 3,400-person rooftop entertainment complex in August that will kick off with performances by Amy Schumer. Sports television giant ESPN also unveiled its new production studios on Pier 17. Plus, construction on the Ronald O. Perlman Performing Arts Center began last year, and it is expected to open in 2020. As for the Trade Center, it's taken awhile, but the nearly 8 million square feet of space at the three main buildings is slowly being filled. 1 World Trade Center is now nearly 80 percent leased. Even the newly opening 3 World Trade center is nearly 40 percent leased, and 4 World Trade Center is 100 percent leased. With so much going on, downtown leaders are trying to improve traffic flows around the New York Stock Exchange, a major business, tourist and business destination. They've also proposed moving the now-iconic Wall Street bull, as well as the Fearless Girl, from their present location in lower Broadway to right in front of the NYSE.

Carl Icahn is joining his protege Keith Meister in a deal that may ultimately lead to their purchase of oil and gas producer Energen Corp. Meister founded his own firm, Corvex Management, in 2010 after years learning the activist trade at Icahn Enterprises, where he was vice chairman of the board and principal executive officer. Any deal for Energen could also affect activist Paul Singer's Elliott Management, which took a stake in the company last year and sided with Corvex in pushing for a sale. Corvex has spent more than a year pressuring Energen to seek a buyer, saying the company had valuable assets in the prolific drilling terrain known as the Permian Basin but that its shares were undervalued. Earlier this year, it nominated four candidates to Energen's board to ratchet up the pressure. The two sides came to an agreement in March, when Energen agreed to appoint two board members and begin a strategic review of its business. show chapters When you're lucky you can't always confuse it with being smart: Carl Icahn 2:28 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 06:34 One of those new board members was Vincent Intrieri, a former senior managing director at Icahn Capital Management who retired from that firm last year. He served on the boards of several companies on behalf of Icahn during his time there, including Hertz Global Holdings and Transocean, where he still sits, and Chesapeake Energy, where he sat from 2012 to 2016. He joined Energen's board in March. But the story is not ending there. On Monday, Corvex said in an amended securities ownership filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a deal to sell 2 million shares of its stake to Icahn and the option for him to buy 2 million more. In total, Icahn would end up with about 4.1 percent, the filing said. Following the transaction, Corvex will have 8.46 million Energen shares, or about 8.7 percent, about even with fellow top shareholder Vanguard Group, but smaller than the nearly 10 percent it previously held, according to FactSet. In March, Energen said its board had begun an in-depth review of its strategic options, getting advice from J. P. Morgan and Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co. Corvex said in the filing on Monday that it believes the company's shares are undervalued and that it may \"have an interest in joining with other parties to acquire the issuer as part of the strategic initiatives process or otherwise.\"' Last year, Singer's Elliott Management joined Corvex in pushing Energen to sell. It holds about 3 percent of Energen's shares, according to FactSet. Elliott said in March it supported Energen's decision to review strategic alternatives. \"We expect that any such review, to be considered truly comprehensive, will be conducted with shareholder input and will include full engagement with interested acquirers,\" it said. A spokesman said Elliott wasn't commenting on Monday's news. On CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Monday, Icahn said he hadn't talked to Singer about the deal. Icahn also said he believed Energen was worth possibly $100 a share and that it might be an attractive purchase for a major energy company, particularly a pipeline operator. The additional pressure from him and Meister seems to be aimed at pushing the strategic review along more quickly. \"We have a lot of cash around. We could buy this company,\" he said, with or without help from others. \"However, I don't presume to feel I'm the right buyer for it because there are such synergies for another company.\" But, Icahn added, Energen's board \"agreed to do a process on March 7 and nobody's heard about that process yet.\" Shares of Energen are up 6 percent in Monday trading. When Energen announced its settlement Corvex, Meister released a statement saying, \"We are pleased to have worked constructively and to have reached a resolution that will bolster the Board with new highly qualified directors as we pursue our common goal of enhancing shareholder value.\" A spokesman said Energen declined to comment.

American beef, corn and soybeans could benefit the most from the latest trade agreements between the U.S. and China. Over the weekend, the two countries issued a joint statement stating that both \"agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports,\" bringing temporary relief to a heated trade dispute. While analysts said the agreement isn't specific enough to have immediate economic impact, some noted key areas in which American farmers would likely benefit. \"We estimate a potential increase of US$60-90bn in Chinese purchases of US goods, with a rise in agriculture imports (particularly beef) in the near term,\" Morgan Stanley Economist Robin Xing, Strategist Michael Zezas and their team said in a note Sunday. show chapters How farmers feel about latest China trade talks 4:23 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 02:23 China reopened its market to U.S. beef in June 2017 for the first time in 14 years after negotiations earlier in the year between the Trump administration and Beijing. Chinese imports of beef globally increased more than nine-fold between 2012 and 2016, to $2.5 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \"Once [our Chinese distributors] get it they can't sell it fast enough. We can't supply them with enough beef right now,\" said Kent Bacus, director of international trade at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Beef accounts for six specific items on China's list of 106 U.S. goods that Beijing announced additional tariffs on in early April, in retaliation against the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Other items on the list include soybeans, corn and wheat. China has \"agriculture products on there to get attention and to inflict pain on key constituencies in the U.S.,\" said Gregory Husisian, chair of the international trade & national security group at Foley & Lardner. As a result, he expects the items targeted by Beijing will be the Trump administration's focus in negotiating details on trade with Beijing. Agriculture overall is strategically a key area for Beijing to work with the U.S. China is the second largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, at $19.6 billion in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service. It's an area in which \"China can quickly show results,\" Husisian said. \"They could just shift purchases from Europe or other countries fairly easily. From their perspective it represents one that doesn't really require them to do that much.\" China has made some concessions on agriculture already. Beijing said Friday it was ending an investigation into imports of U.S. sorghum. The probe had effectively halted trade worth roughly $1.1 billion in 2017. Further agreements on U.S. agriculture exports will need similar specifics on product type and amount for a deal to be economically effective, analysts said. Even in the growing beef market, Bacus said Chinese restrictions on imports of the meat injected with hormones or fed \"beta-agonists\" makes it difficult for U.S. exporters. \"We are not anywhere close to reaching our potential in that market,\" Bacus said. President Donald Trump does appear focused on improving the trade environment for U.S. agriculture. He focused two of his tweets Monday on the weekend trade deal on the industry: \"Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,\" Trump tweeted. \"There's a relief for American farmers here because we were headed towards a situation where the Chinese were going to block imports of U.S. goods,\" said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist at the China Beige Book. However, the latest developments are just \"a restoration of the status quo.\" \"If you're playing defense, you're trying to protect the soybean trade. If you're playing offense\" you will name a particular product, Scissors said. \"The test is whether we're going to get specific goods being mentioned.\" WATCH: How Chinese businesses can adapt to

General Electric did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The transportation deal is the first major step for CEO John Flannery, who took the reins last August. The CEO is in the middle of a strategic review of the company that could lead to other segment separations before the company stabilizes. The company also cut its quarterly payout in half last year in an effort to free up some cash. The transportation unit \u2014 which largely builds trains \u2014 is one of the company's smaller units, representing slightly more than 3 percent of GE's total revenue, according to FactSet data. \"The offset to these negatives has simply been yet another change in how the company reports adjusted EPS, and related guidance that is 'unchanged,' with a series of restatements that helped to further obfuscate,\" Tusa wrote. \"If the outcome of the next several months is more complex, financially engineered moves short on cash, and built on promises around future growth, on the back of perpetually adjusted numbers, we scratch our heads as to how that cannot be juxtaposed to the 'fresh start/reset' narrative.\" The analyst reiterated his underweight rating on the stock as well as his 12-month price target of $11, implying 27 percent downside over the next year.

Apple's iPhone X demand remains soft while the latest look into its services business growth proved \"good not great,\" according to Nomura Instinet. Analysis of recent iPhone average selling prices \u2014 a key metric offering insight into the generations of iPhones being sold \u2014 implied a thinner mix of iPhone X volumes than hoped, analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a note to clients Monday. \"iPhone volumes are not deteriorating though iPhone X remains uninspiring,\" Kvaal wrote. \"Apple guidance implied third fiscal-quarter iPhone unit volumes that were better than feared. We do not believe, however, sell through has meaningfully improved.\" Kvaal, who maintained his neutral rating on shares of the technology company, said part of the problem stems from a decline in the rate of phone upgrades, with the average upgrade rate at the major U.S. telecommunication companies slipping to 5.3 percent in the first quarter of the calendar year. The analyst sees Apple slumping 6 percent from last week's close to $175 over the next 12 months. \"We see little reason for [the upgrade rate] to improve in the near term,\" he added. \"None of the carriers appear particularly distraught by the lower gross adds \u2014 and lower churn \u2014 that accompanies the lower upgrade rate. Verizon expects to remain disciplined and Sprint also expects to be less promotional.\" Kvaal also argued that while Apple's services business should continue to grow at a solid pace, Wall Street would be better able to assess the impact of the segment if the company were more forthcoming about its revenue generation. Services revenue has consistently grown above 20 percent on an annualized basis, with recent strength in licensing, App Store, and AppleCare keeping the progress on track. Still, Kvaal isn't entirely convinced. \"Apple has made several sustainable improvements to the Services growth trajectory,\" he said, \"[but] we believe the tailwind from licensing and from AppleCare may ease in coming quarters. ... We would appreciate better disclosure from Apple on its Services business to help gauge revenue growth.\" Shares have gained roughly 10 percent this month, rallying after both strong earnings performance and guidance as well as an additional investment from Warren Buffett, who revealed that Berkshire Hathaway bought an additional 75 million shares. The stock's price was $186.31 as of Friday's close, implying a market cap of $915 billion and within $20 of making Apple the first company to ever reach a value of $1 trillion.

But a Goldman Sachs strategist says it's not time to worry just yet. David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note Friday that investors should not worry about rising borrowing costs and their effect on stock valuations until the 10-year Treasury yield zeroes in on 4 percent. The benchmark note yielded 3.07 percent on Monday. \"A rise in interest rates should lead to a fall in equity prices, all else equal. An equity's value is equal to the present value of a perpetual stream of future dividends, which are highly sensitive to the discount rate,\" said Kostin. \"However, lower equity prices are not an inevitable consequence of higher interest rates. We expect negative valuation changes if the level of rates approaches 4%.\" He also said stock prices could take a hit before that level is reached if rates rise too rapidly. show chapters Goldman Sachs chief strategist: The economy will continue to grow this year and next year 10:35 AM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 02:12 Yields have been rising as investors fear that inflationary pressures in the U.S. will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than expected. The 10-year yield hit 3.11 percent last week \u2014 its highest level since 2011 \u2014 while the two-year yield hovered around a near-decade high. \"The actual impact of interest rate changes on equity prices depends on the reason interest rates are rising. If interest rates rise in anticipation of faster economic activity, this could lift growth expectations and also lower the equity risk premium,\" noted Kostin. The 10-year yield had risen about 71 basis points year to date through Friday, Kostin points out. Stocks, however, have weathered the sharp rise in yields thus far. Entering Monday's session, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were up 1.5 percent and 6.5 percent for the year, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. The small-caps Russell 2000, meanwhile, hit an all-time intraday high Monday and is up 6,6 percent in 2018. \"Assuming no valuation change, strong earnings and dividend growth will lift the S&P 500 index to our year-end 2018 target of 2850,\" said Kostin. The strategist added he recommended investors overweight the financials sector, which benefits from rising interest rates.

Economic Cycle Research Institute co-founder Lakshman Achuthan warned on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" that an economic slowdown is already here \u2014 suggesting that Wall Street is dangerously optimistic right now. \"There's some tension here between what's going on with the economy outside your window and what's going on with expectations on Wall Street,\" Achuthan said Monday. \"There is a stealth slowdown already happening.\" He provided a chart that showed real consumer spending and income growth \"rolling over.\" \"Since late last year, consumer spending growth has been easing, as has personal income growth,\" he noted. \"That points to a fresh softening in a big part of the U.S. economy.\" That's not the only bearish trend in the chart, according to Achuthan. \"Spending is outpacing income growth,\" he said. \"That puts a lot of pressure on consumers, especially if interest rates are starting to rise.\" His thoughts came as the Dow was rallying to close above the 25,000 mark for the first time since March. The index is now positive for the year. The S&P 500 also had a strong day, settling up 0.74 percent on Monday for its best day since May 10. Achuthan wasn't sure when Wall Street could begin taking the economic sluggishness more seriously. But he still concluded that stocks are \"cruising for a bruising right here.\" \"From an economic cycle risk point of view, the risk is rising,\" Achuthan said. \"We have further slowing to go.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Now Mr. Achleitner is being cast in a new role: the man responsible for the sorry state of one of Germany's most important industries. Mr. Achleitner has been the chairman of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board since 2012, overseeing the company's top management and signing off on major business decisions. As the bank stumbles from one crisis to the next, investors blame him for the missteps that have brought the company to one of the most perilous moments in its nearly 150-year history. More from the New York Times: UK unlikely to block Comcast's proposed sky takeover, minister says How one company scammed Silicon Valley. And how it got caught. UK court dismisses charges over Qatar fund-raising by Barclays It is the latest blow to the reputation of a man who had been one of Germany's most renowned bankers since the fall of communism. Mr. Achleitner is increasingly viewed as responsible for a series of ill-fated mergers and questionable decisions over the past two decades that have left Germany, and indeed all of Europe, without a serious rival to the likes of Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Even today, Mr. Achleitner \u2014 who is not German, but Austrian \u2014 embodies corporate Germany. In addition to his role at Deutsche Bank, he sits on the oversight boards of three other blue-chip German companies, including the automaker Daimler. Friends and acquaintances describe him as a master networker who is quick to reply to text messages and has a knack for making people feel important. Mr. Achleitner's wife, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, a professor of business at the Technical University of Munich, also sits on the supervisory boards of several large German corporations. They are one of Germany's premier power couples. But Mr. Achleitner's grasp on power appears increasingly tenuous. When Deutsche Bank's shareholders gather for the company's annual meeting on Thursday, one of the items on the agenda will be a motion to oust Mr. Achleitner. Mr. Achleitner is expected to survive, at least for now, protected partly because the bank's chief executive, John Cryan, was ousted just last month. The departure of Mr. Achleitner could throw the bank into even greater turmoil. Mr. Achleitner, who declined to comment for this article, should be given \"one last chance,\" Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises investors on how to vote, said in a report this month. Removing Mr. Achleitner could distract the supervisory board from \"the truly precarious situation at hand: the entire future strategy and survival of the bank.\" Mr. Achleitner made a name for himself in the 1990s when the German government was selling assets like chemical factories that had belonged to the Communist government of East Germany. Other German bankers turned up their noses. But Mr. Achleitner, who was the first native German speaker to run Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, recognized an opportunity. He used the assignment to forge political and corporate ties and establish Goldman as a player in Germany. Mr. Achleitner's approach paid off in 1994 when Deutsche Telekom, the German telephone monopoly, prepared to sell shares to the public for the first time. The German government chose Goldman Sachs to be one of three banks handling the large share sale, alongside Germany's Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank. Goldman's lead role came as a rude awakening to the German banks, which had taken it for granted that they would share such transactions among themselves. That led Deutsche Bank in particular to hastily bulk up in investment banking to fend off foreign competitors. One fateful result was Deutsche Bank's purchase of Bankers Trust in 1998 for $10.1 billion. The transaction instantly made Deutsche Bank a presence on Wall Street, as well as the biggest bank in the world by assets. Goldman Sachs advised Deutsche Bank on the transaction, with Mr. Achleitner playing a supporting role as head of the Frankfurt office. The Bankers Trust deal was troubled from the start. The price was considered steep for a bank that had recently suffered a series of scandals, including accusations of selling derivatives without warning customers about the risks. show chapters Deutsche Bank\u2019s Achleitner: Fundamental challenge is credit pricing 6:02 AM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 | 02:22 But Mr. Achleitner's reputation as a dealmaker continued to grow. In 2000, he left Goldman to become chief financial officer at Allianz, the German insurer. Back then, Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank owned stakes in one another as well as in many of the largest German companies and dominated their supervisory boards. The network was unofficially known as Germany Inc., and scared away foreign investors. Mr. Achleitner's job was to either unload Allianz's holdings or find a way to make them more valuable. Among Allianz's biggest stakes was 21 percent of Dresdner Bank, one of Germany's biggest banks. First Mr. Achleitner tried to orchestrate a merger between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank, in which Allianz also owned a stake. When that idea was torpedoed by investment bankers at Deutsche Bank, he took a different tack, engineering Allianz's 2001 acquisition of the majority of Dresdner. The plan was to use the bank's retail network to sell insurance products. But Dresdner's huge portfolio of problematic loans left Allianz financially vulnerable. In 2002, after reporting a \u20ac2.5 billion loss in the third quarter, the company found itself in serious trouble. Still, Mr. Achleitner managed to emerge from the crisis as a hero. In 2003, he arrived late to a management board meeting in Munich. He looked weary and unshaven, according to Emilio Galli Zugaro, the former head of communications for Allianz who was present at the meeting. Mr. Achleitner had just come from an all-night negotiating session in Hamburg with potential buyers of Allianz's stake in Beiersdorf, a German company best known as the maker of Nivea face cream. Allianz badly needed the cash. A group of German investors had agreed to pay \u20ac4.4 billion for the Beiersdorf shares, Mr. Achleitner reported. The Allianz executives, normally a restrained group, gave Mr. Achleitner a standing ovation. The Dresdner Bank deal, however, remained a problem for Allianz. In August 2008, as a global financial crisis gathered force, Allianz sold Dresdner to Commerzbank. The price was \u20ac9.8 billion, less than half of Dresdner Bank's value when Allianz acquired its stake in 2001. Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis. Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry's worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions. Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner's backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues. Mr. Achleitner insisted that Europe needed a counterweight to the big American investment banks. \"If we don't watch out,\" he said in an interview with a German magazine in May 2015, \"we'll have the same American dominance that we already have in the internet.\" Weeks later, the bank's co-chief executive, Anshu Jain, one of the architects of the investment bank, resigned under pressure from shareholders and regulators unhappy with the way the bank had responded to government investigations. Mr. Achleitner chose Mr. Cryan, his colleague on the supervisory board, to succeed Mr. Jain. Mr. Cryan tried to refine Deutsche Bank's strategy and to instill a more ethical corporate culture. Less than three years into Mr. Cryan's tenure, Mr. Achleitner grew disenchanted. He contacted a number of executives at rival financial institutions to gauge their interest in taking over as chief executive. In late March, Mr. Achleitner was on an Amazon River cruise with his family when The Times of London reported that he had secretly been talking to possible replacements for Mr. Cryan. Mr. Achleitner rushed back to Frankfurt. Mr. Cryan was in limbo for more than a week. Mr. Achleitner remained silent. Finally, in early April, the board voted to replace him with Christian Sewing, a risk expert who has spent his entire career at the bank. Mr. Sewing quickly announced plans to scale back the investment bank. But Deutsche Bank is years behind European rivals in reorienting itself toward other lines of business that are less prone to scandal and losses. \"There have been a series of missteps going back quite a while, and I do think Chairman Achleitner is part of the problem,\" said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership at Yale School of Management. \"At some point someone should be accountable.\" ", "author": "Michele Limina | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link":

According to forecasts from the bank's chief economist, the federal deficit will increase from $825 billion (or 4.1 percent of gross domestic product) to $1.25 trillion (5.5 percent of GDP) by 2021. And by 2028, the bank expects the number to balloon to $2.05 trillion (7 percent of GDP). \"An expanding deficit and debt level is likely to put upward pressure on interest rates, expanding the deficit further,\" Jan Hatzius \u2014 Goldman's chief economist \u2014 wrote Sunday. \"While we do not believe that the U.S. faces a risk to its ability to borrow or repay, the rising debt level could nevertheless have three consequences long before debt sustainability becomes a major obstacle.\" show chapters Goldman Sachs says there could be a significant jump in interest rates 4:23 PM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 01:00 Legislators passed a package of corporate and individual tax cuts in December, a two-year budget deal in February and a massive spending bill in March that boosted government expenditures on both domestic and military programs. In light of the big spending and easier tax burden, the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 Capitol Hill's nonpartisan financial scorekeeper \u2013 in April projected that debt could equal GDP within a decade if Congress extends the tax cuts, a level not seen since World War II. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Economic growth should jump above 3 percent in 2018 thanks to the stimuli, the CBO said, but the acceleration will likely prove brief, and debt held by the public will soar to $28.7 trillion by the end of fiscal 2028. That could create a precarious situation for Congress if the economy faces an economic downturn in the near term, Hatzius wrote, hampering legislators' ability provide additional fiscal stimulus. \"Lawmakers might hesitate to approve fiscal stimulus in the next downturn in light of the already substantial budget deficit,\" the economist said. \"While we would expect some additional loosening of fiscal policy during the next downturn, there is a good chance in our view that it would be less aggressive than it was in the last few recessions.\" But even if the debt and deficit levels don't prevent lawmakers from approving countercyclical fiscal stimulus during the next recession, a political desire to stabilize the debt level would likely arrest growth during the next recovery, the Goldman team explained. \"The current fiscal expansion ... must at some point give way not just to a neutral stance, which we expect by 2020, but to a tightening of fiscal policy that could restrict growth,\" Hatzius wrote. Finally, the economist explained that regardless of how much longer the current expansion persists, increasing deficits and debts naturally put upward pressure on interest rates, expanding the deficit further. According to estimates by Goldman Sachs, a 1 percentage point increase in the budget deficit raises the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 20 basis points when the economy is at or beyond full employment, as it appears to be currently. \"Surprises are clearly possible in both directions, but we believe the risks are tilted in the direction of larger deficits than projected,\" Hatzius concluded. \"While we expect Congress will eventually address the widening budget gap, it also seems quite likely to take longer than most market participants might expect.\" WATCH: Wall St. ignoring 'stealth slowdown' in economy show chapters Wall Street ignoring \u2018stealth slowdown\u2019 in economy, warns former super bull 4:44 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 01:46 Disclaimer ", "author": "Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/goldman-sachs-the-fiscal-outlook-for-the-us-is-not-good.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Santelli Exchange", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "12:30 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "11", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "02:50", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$825 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "4.1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "$1.25 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "5.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2021", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2028", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$2.05 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Jan Hatzius \u2014 Goldman's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Sunday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "PM ET Mon", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "14 May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "01:00", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "February", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 Capitol Hill's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "a decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Congress", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "World War II", "category": "EVENT"}, {"term": "500px;border", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CBO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$28.7 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the end of fiscal 2028", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Congress", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hatzius", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Goldman", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "2020", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Hatzius", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "10-year", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "roughly 20", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Hatzius", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Congress", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "4:44 PM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "21", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Huge budget deficits and national debt could pose a threat to the country's economic security during the next recession, Goldman warned.", "title": "Goldman Sachs: The fiscal outlook for the US 'is not good'", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/13/105131112-GettyImages-80639420.jpg?v=1523643130"}, {"time": "2018-05-22T08:13:38-0400", "body": " show chapters Yield curve points to challenges for US economy, warns investor 8:13 AM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 03:51 The bond market is signaling an upcoming correction and investors should sell their shares in listed companies, a strategist told CNBC Tuesday. Borrowing costs have gone up over the last few weeks, with the yield on both the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and the two-year bond reaching multiyear highs last Friday. Higher yields, which move inversely to bond prices, pose a risk for equity markets, given that they mean higher costs for companies and, thus, fewer chances for shareholders to make profits. At the same time, the difference between long and short-term borrowing costs keeps narrowing, in what investors describe as a flattening of the yield curve. This indicates that investors see debt that is to be repaid in two years being nearly as risky as lending it for 10 years. In a normal, functioning economy, lending in the short term has fewer risks \u2014 the underlying thought is that you can more easily predict what's happening tomorrow rather next month. \"Yields are going up and the yield curve is flattening, you very rarely get good outcomes from this,\" Michael Howell, chief executive officer at Border Capital, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Tuesday. \"I am dancing closer to the fire exit than I have been for some time.\" -Neil Dwane, Global strategist at Allianz Global Investors He added that those fully invested in equities should be \"very worried.\" Apart from the uptick in yields, there is a group of factors posing the seeds for a potential correction. These are: higher risk appetite, reduced capital flows and a continued monetary policy tightening from central banks, Howell said in a note. Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S. The most influential central banks across the world are set to slowly end the era of cheap money, by increasing borrowing costs. Ultimately, this could exacerbate the problem of higher yields even more. Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC that the markets haven't fully understood that central bank policy is changing. \"We are concerned the market is understating the impact of quantitative tightening, particularly in the U.S.,\" he said, adding, \"I am dancing closer to the fire exit than I have been for some time.\" Amid expectations of a storm in equity markets and higher short-term yields, Howell suggested investors should exit the equity market. \"Take your money off the table,\" he said, adding that investors should then only put that money back after a correction has taken place.

Enthusiasm around the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, remains strong despite warnings from investors such as Warren Buffett that they're worthless. That mania and attempts to launch new units of money have existed in different forms since the 1800s, Shiller said. Shiller, best known for warning about the housing and dot-com bubbles, pointed to the early 19th century, when merchants tried to replace the gold standard with \"time money.\" The \"Cincinnati Time Store\" for example sold merchandise in units of work and closed just three years after it launched. One hundred years later during the Great Depression, economist John Pease Norton proposed a dollar by electricity, which also failed to catch on. show chapters Bitcoin craze is more psychological than economic: Nobel laureate 10:10 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:56 \"Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story,\" Shiller wrote in a blog post Monday. \"But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\" Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no different, he said. They were introduced by a community of entrepreneurs who, as Shiller put it, \"hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\" The mania around bitcoin today is also due in part to its mystery, the Yale University professor said. \"Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,\" Shiller said. \"None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\" The height of the public's fascination was also undoubtedly tied to bitcoin's meteoric rise in price. The world's first cryptocurrency rose to near $20,000 last year before losing roughly half of its value in the first quarter of 2018. Here is the full post by Shiller.

A British court has dismissed charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) against Barclays over its 2008 capital raising, the bank said on Monday, suspending for now the threat of regulatory sanctions on its business operations. The SFO was, however, not prepared to let the case drop. \"We are likely to seek to reinstate the charges by applying to the High Court,\" an SFO spokesman said. It was not clear when that application would be heard. Barclays denied the SFO's allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped it avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis, unlike its rivals Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. An end to the SFO's case against Barclays and its operating subsidiary would remove the biggest remaining legal headache facing Barclays over its conduct during the financial crisis. The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions would also represent a major setback for the SFO, with the prosecutor's office under fire from politicians in recent years. Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing itself, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as \"financial assistance\". The SFO had been pursuing charges that Barclays unlawfully received such financial assistance, and that it had conspired with former senior executives to commit fraud over two so-called 'advisory services agreements' between Qatar and the bank which facilitated the fundraising. Not over yet Even if the SFO were to fail in its efforts to reinstate the charges, Barclays still faces other legal and regulatory problems related to the 2008 fundraising. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the advisory services agreements. Separately four former Barclays bankers face a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, in a trial due to start next January.

Mr Varley today appears with three other former executives of Barclays in relation to a Serious Fraud Office investigation over the way the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. The four are former chief executive John Varley, and senior executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath. Barclays said the dismissal of the charges against itself should not be taken to have any bearing on whether other people may have committed a criminal offence. Lawyers representing Boath and Jenkins declined to comment, while lawyers for the other two did not immediately respond to requests for comment. British businesswoman Amanda Staveley has a separate $1 billion civil lawsuit against Barclays over the same fundraising. Staveley's private equity group PCP Capital Partners is claiming damages for alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in a row over whether Barclays offered Qatar and Abu Dhabi investors the same deal terms for participating in a fundraising in 2008. Barclays has called the PCP lawsuit \"misconceived.\" Staveley declined to comment. Barclays shares were up 0.7 percent by 1300 GMT, in line with the FTSE 350 British banks index.

U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp has agreed to buy smaller rival MB Financial in a stock-and-cash deal valued at about $4.7 billion as it looks to expand in Chicago and broaden its middle market customer base. A windfall from last year's Republican tax overhaul has encouraged more investment among mid-sized U.S. lenders and banks are also hopeful that legislative moves to roll back some rules on capital requirements will free up more cash. That runs contrary to the several years of minimal merger activity in the sector due to stricter rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis which effectively put limits on expansion. As part of the deal announced on Monday, each MB Financial shareholder will get $54.20, comprising 1.45 shares of Fifth Third common stock and $5.54 in cash, a 24 percent premium to MB Financial's last close. The merger with Chicago-based MB Financial will result in the combined entity having a total Chicago deposit market share of 6.5 percent, ranking it fourth in total deposits among the nearly 200 banks in the marketplace, Fifth Third said. Fifth Third Bank, which operates 1,300 branches and 2,600 ATMs across 12 states, said the deal is expected to reduce its regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 45 basis points. Fifth Third also said once the deal closes, two members of MB Financial's board of directors were expected to join the Fifth Third Bancorp board.

The company published videos showing the interior and workings of what it said was three fully operating mining farms. State regulators said the videos were actually sourced from publicly available stock footage. The Texas regulator also took action against Wind Wide Coin, which used pictures of celebrities including Jennifer Aniston and Prince Charles to advertise its cryptocurrency. \"Promoters also know that anyone can be anyone and say anything about anything on the internet,\" Rotunda said. \"Not surprisingly, they are also manipulating photographs, media, testimonials and other online information to deceive the public into believing their claims.\" The crackdown comes amid growing attention in the U.S. to cryptocurrency scams, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC has brought several fraud cases against operators of initial coin offerings and last week launched a website to help investors recognize scams. Massachusetts regulators are also participating in the crackdown. William Francis Galvin, the state's secretary of the commonwealth, said NASAA's task force found roughly 30,000 crypto-related domain name registrations, many of which appeared in late 2017 as the price of bitcoin neared $20,000. \"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" Galvin said in a statement. \"Fraudulent activity involving ICOs and cryptocurrency-related investment products is a serious threat to Massachusetts investors.\" WATCH: This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID show chapters This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID 8:46 AM ET Sun, 13 May 2018 | 03:18 ", "author": "Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/state-regulators-crack-down-on-cryptocurrency-investment-schemes.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Jaap Arriens", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "NurPhoto", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Regulators", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "More than 40", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Operation Crypto-Sweep", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "at least 70", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "The Washington Post", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Joseph Rotunda", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Texas State Securities Board", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8:10 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "21", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Dec 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Texas", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "BTCrush", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Texas", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Wind Wide Coin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Jennifer Aniston", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Rotunda", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the Securities and Exchange Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Massachusetts", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "William Francis Galvin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "NASAA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "roughly 30,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "late 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Galvin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Massachusetts", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "13", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "03:18", "category": "PRODUCT"}], "description": "Regulators in the U.S. and Canada are launching a widespread crackdown on some cryptocurrency investment schemes in what's called \"Operation Cryptosweep.\" ", "title": "State regulators launch 'Operation Crypto-Sweep' to police cryptocurrency investment schemes", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/21/104912513-_sites_default_files_images_104912513-GettyImages-892695676.jpg?v=1516925827"}, {"time": "2018-05-22T17:50:16-0400", "body": " Getty Images Check out the companies making headlines after the bell: Red Robin Gourmet Burgers stock plunged more than 16 percent after the bell, after the burger chain missed on top and bottom lines in the first quarter.

Comcast, CNBC's parent company, said in a statement that the offer would top the value of the deal with Disney, but no final decision has been made. It did say that efforts to finance the bid and submit key regulatory filings are \"well advanced.\" Shares of Comcast closed 1.9 percent lower Wednesday, while Disney shares fell 1.1 percent. Fox shares gained 1.6 percent. \"Everything I hear indicates that [Comcast CEO] Brian Roberts is extremely focused and aggressive in terms of wanting to own these assets,\" CNBC's David Faber said Wednesday on \"Squawk Box.\" However, Fox may find Comcast's bid less attractive than Disney's for tax reasons, Faber said, citing sources. Disney's stock offer would allow Fox to spin off its assets tax free, while a cash offer from Comcast would result in a taxable spin, the sources said. Disney announced an agreement in mid-December to acquire Fox's movie studios, the Nat Geo and FX networks, regional sports networks and other parts of the company for $52.4 billion in stock. The deal, which included stakes in Sky and Hulu, had a total value of about $66.1 billion. Such an acquisition would boost Disney's efforts to compete with Netflix in streaming. \"In a nutshell, if Comcast won these assets from the arms of Disney it would be a 'devastating blow' to [Disney CEO Bob] Iger and Disney's streaming ambitions going forward,\" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note Wednesday. Citing sources, CNBC reported earlier this month that Comcast was preparing to make a bid for the assets in mid-June. CNBC also reported that week that Comcast was preparing an all-cash bid of $60 billion, topping Disney's deal, if the government approved AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. Sources also told CNBC this month that Comcast could take on debt of up to $100 billion in the deal. The Fox assets under consideration do not include the Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company and certain other components.

TWEET The statement comes as the White House negotiates the framework of a deal to avoid tariffs between the countries. The administration has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports unless China cuts its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion in two years, aiming to spur China's buying of billions more in U.S. goods. Investors were hopeful a deal could be close after Treasury Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the trade war was \"on hold.\" On Saturday, the U.S. and China issued a joint statement on trade consultations saying \"both sides agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports. The United States will send a team to China to work out the details.\" The tentative deal would involve increased U.S. exports of goods such as agricultural and energy commodities and China lowering of trade barriers. In tweets Monday morning, the president said China \"has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products,\" and wrote separately that barriers and tariffs would \"come down\" for the \"first time.\" Trump's key advisors are still working on the details. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently announced plans to visit Bejing in early June to work out the details of the commitment by China. show chapters This trade deal may be what Trump needs to take on China 1:04 PM ET Fri, 27 April 2018 | 03:17 Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic advisor, told CNBC on Monday that the United States would not rule out tariffs on China as a \"negotiating\" or \"enforcement\" tool, despite \"progress\" made last week during talks with Beijing. But on Tuesday, Trump said he was \"not satisfied\" with the trade talks taking place. His comments hit the stock market and continued to weigh on stocks Wednesday. Another deal is apparently on thin ice as well. Trump said Tuesday that the highly anticipated summit with North Korea may not happen after all.

the newly opened Nordstrom men\u00d5s store, the company\u00d5s first-ever Manhattan location in midtown at 57th and Broadway on April 12, 2018 in New York City. Nordstrom's recent earnings sell-off presents a compelling buying opportunity, according to Deutsche Bank, which upgraded the stock to a buy rating and called the drop in share price \"overdone.\" \"We believe Nordstrom has the best developed digital strategy within our department store coverage, with 29 percent of sales now digitally enabled,\" analyst Paul Trussell wrote Wednesday. This, \"combined with a relatively small store network and increasing penetration of exclusive/limited distribution brands, positions the company well in the long run for market share gains.\" Though the company missed first-quarter earnings in March, the analyst argued that the fact it raised the lower end of its earnings per share estimates for fiscal year 2018 was encouraging. The analyst estimates the retailer will generate fiscal 2018 earnings per share of $3.55 versus the Wall Street consensus of $3.46, according to FactSet data. \"We see modest upside to estimates as a number of initiatives gain traction throughout the year, including the focus on the addition of new, differentiated and exclusive brands, combined with lean inventory positions at both Nordstrom and department store peers and improving macro data points,\" he said. Trussell revised his price target on shares of Nordstrom higher to $55 from $52, implying more than 20 percent upside from Tuesday's close. The stock, however, has underperformed in 2018; shares are down 3.4 percent since January against the S&P 500's 1.9 percent climb.

U.S. lawmakers closed a long-standing legal loophole that helped spark a financial crisis in Puerto Rico that has decimated the savings of thousands of residents. Tucked inside legislation that passed the House of Representatives Tuesday night \u2014 a larger bill largely focused on rolling back Dodd-Frank banking regulation \u2014 is a provision that creates greater oversight of brokerage firms operating in U.S. territories. The provision ends a 78-year-old legislative loophole that allowed subsidiaries of global banking institutions that operated in U.S. territories, like Puerto Rico, to do certain types of financial transactions that are legally barred stateside. This exemption from the so-called Investment Company Act of 1940 also allowed funds in Puerto Rico to skirt leverage standards and certain affiliated party transactions that apply to funds operating in the U.S. The loophole allowed for Swiss banking giant UBS and other banks to underwrite specific Puerto Rico bonds and then sell them directly into bond funds that were sold only to island residents, a CNBC investigation, published in December, found. show chapters Bill does not weaken regulations for largest banks: Barney Frank 3:59 PM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 06:30 The funds, which were not registered with the SEC, were highly levered and concentrated largely in Puerto Rico bonds, which became practically worthless in recent years. The residents who bought them lost billions of dollars in savings. The legislation passed Tuesday repeals the exemption to ensure that financial institutions that operate in all U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have to abide by the same rules as their stateside counterparts. Funds issued and sold to investors by institutions in Puerto Rico will now need to be registered with the SEC. CNBC's investigation prompted Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) to call for a congressional hearing to investigate the marketing and sales practices of investment companies operating in Puerto Rico. Her office is expecting that the passage of Tuesday's bill will negate the need for such a hearing. Vel\u00e1zquez, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, had tried three times before, in 2015, 2016 and last year, to close the loophole. But her prior bills, which weren't part of a bigger legislative package, failed to pass. When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act of 1940, it was deemed too expensive for regulators with the SEC to travel to U.S. territories \u2014 which then also included Alaska and Hawaii, in addition to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since then, both Alaska and Hawaii have become states, air travel to and from Puerto Rico has become less expensive and a large portion of financial activity takes place electronically. That makes it far easier for regulators to patrol financial activities in U.S. territories than it was 78 years ago, Rep. Vel\u00e1zquez has argued. The bill, called the \"Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, passed on Tuesday. Velazquez said she voted no on it for other reasons. For example, the bill rolls back many protections for bank customers, including preventing discrimination against minorities in mortgage lending. It also raises the threshold for a bank to be considered systemically important to $250 billion in assets. It was seen as favorable to medium-sized U.S. banks by loosening some of the current rules. \"On balance, these are poor choices that, in my view, heighten the risk of improper financial activities similar to those that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis,\" Velazquez said in a statement. On-island financial institutions will have three years to comply with the new rules, assuming they get signed into law. The SEC has to option to grant an additional three years, if warranted. \"This bill will put Puerto Rico's mutual fund industry in regulatory parity with the Mainland and, at last, bring to an end decades of exploitation of Puerto Rican investors,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said in a written statement. \"I am heartened, at least, that by passing my legislation, as part of this larger package, we will no longer hear of the people of Puerto Rico being swindled out of their nest eggs due to an antiquated loophole in federal investment law.\" WATCH: 5 buys for Dodd-Frank overhaul show chapters Dodd-Frank

Beijing's latest concession in a trade dispute with the U.S. will likely benefit Germany the most. On Tuesday, China's Finance Ministry announced plans to cut tariffs on some foreign automobiles to 15 percent, down from as much as 25 percent. The lowered duties will take effect July 1 and come after the Trump administration agreed this weekend to hold off on imposing tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods. China is a major market for U.S. automakers, and shares of General Motors and Ford rose more than half a percent in Tuesday trading. But when it comes to global trade, Germany sells more passenger cars in China than any other country does, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); In the first four months of this year, German-made vehicles accounted for 20.8 percent of passenger cars sold in China, or 1.67 million units, the association said in an online post dated Friday.

Worldwide dealmaking for 2018 topped the $2 trillion mark this week, on track for the biggest year for mergers and acquisitions ever, according to data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. Global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start to a year ever, totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter and that action has continued in the second quarter. Media, telecom, consumer staples, healthcare and retail sectors have been especially hot. This week began with a standout \"Merger Monday\" of announced deals: General Electric confirmed it will merge its transportation business with U.S. manufacturer Wabtec in an $11.1 billion deal. Data firm IHS Markit said it will buy smaller rival from private-equity funds of Blackstone and Goldman Sachs for $1.86 billion, and U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp announced a $4.7 billion deal to buy MB Financial. Meanwhile, Blackstone said it would buy U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties for $3.7 billion. Global deals year-to-date Source: Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence Data as of May 21, 2018 Tax cuts helped set the stage for the recent boom in deals. The Republican tax reform bill, which was signed by President Trump in December, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and made it cheaper for multinational companies to repatriate foreign cash. Companies have been putting putting the extra savings to work with additional investments. The value of M&A deals globally increased 67 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows but the number of deals dropped by 10 percent, reflecting that the average size of deals is getting bigger. Among the mega- deals this year; U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp said it will acquire U.S. pharmacy chain Express Scripts for $67 billion, and German utility E.ON SE announced a $38.5 billion deal to buy RWE AG's renewable energy business. On the regulatory front though, there is still uncertainty. The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner over antitrust concerns, and later called the deal \"illegal\" and \"harmful\" to consumers.

Stacey Cunningham, NYSE Group's newly named president, said initial public offerings are lined up for June as the Big Board continues to battle Nasdaq for new listings. Regulation and private equity capital have kept many smaller companies out of the public markets for far longer than they used to wait to start trading stock, and that is one of the challenges to the business, she told CNBC Tuesday in an interview from the floor of the NYSE. As of Tuesday, 77 initial public offerings have filed this year, up 8.5 percent from this time last year, according to Renaissance Capital. Companies listing have raised $22.7 billion, up 35 percent. NYSE has scored some of the higher profile new listings in the last year, including Snap and Blue Apron. Spotify also listed there for the first time earlier this year, though using a slightly different method. \"We do have a strong pipeline coming up in June,\" Cunningham said on CNBC. \"But we want to make sure we haven't gone too far to a market structure that has created and environment that's good for big companies and big investors. We want to be able to welcome companies of small sizes earlier in their life.\" NYSE's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, named Cunningham NYSE Group''s president on Tuesday. Cunningham, who began working on the floor of the exchange after college in the mid-1990s is the first woman to hold that title there. She takes on the role officially on Friday. At Nasdaq, Adena Friedman has been CEO since last year. In the early 2000s, before ICE acquired NYSE, Catherine Kinney was co-president of the exchange. Cunningham said she doesn't plan to make drastic changes like getting rid of the NYSE's physical trading floor, even though she admits it's no longer really necessary to have one. \"I grew up down here. I certainly hope we are sitting here in five years,\" she said. \"This community provides value.\" Cunningham is taking over from Tom Farley, who is moving on to head up Far Point Acquisition, a blank check company that will focus on acquiring fintech businesses.

For starters, the size of the Chinese market presented an attractive proposition. \"It's too big to ignore. This year, Guangdong Province has become larger than the entire Russian economy and I could reel off about a dozen other statistics like that. It's just so big now and yet people have always treated it as a tactical bet, so they've never really owned much of it,\" Matthews said. Foreign ownership of A shares, or Chinese stocks traded on the mainland, is relatively low, with most estimates currently putting the figure at around 2 percent. Better management in the country on a macro level was another positive factor, said Matthews. He cited the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy to boost local industry, the far-reaching Belt and Road Initiative and deleveraging as examples of those improvements. \"And the companies are much better than they were 10 years ago,\" he added. Chinese assets also did not look expensive, according to Matthews. \"There's no other market in Asia that has this kind of value,\" he said. Ahead, MSCI's addition of A shares to its equity indexes is set to take place on June 1. \"We know that's just a first step so there'll be a lot more allocation to come,\" Matthews said. Estimates for the levels of initial flows into the mainland stock market vary, with some analysts expecting more than $400 billion in inflows when A shares are fully included. In the near term, J.P. Morgan has forecast some $6.6 billion in passive inflows migrating to MSCI China companies, as well as up to $40 billion in active flows.

Many companies are trying to create a digital payments economy, but they face stiff competition from regular currencies, according to Sri Shivananda, senior vice president and chief technology officer at PayPal. \"The competition is cash,\" Shivananda told CNBC in an interview last month. \"It's not even, like, you're fighting for each other's volumes. It's actually cash.\" Last year, a study from consulting firm Capgemini and bank BNP Paribas predicted that by 2020, people around the world would make about 726 billion transactions using digital payment technology. The study found that emerging markets are expected to drive the upward trend. Developments in new technologies such as contactless bank cards, wearable devices and augmented reality will drive cashless transactions in the future, according to the study. Still, it acknowledged that cash remained the main method of payment among users. In fact, other research findings and surveys have demonstrated that many around the world still prefer to use cash. Cash is king Last August, a PayPal study found cash was still king in Asia, with China being an outlier where majority of the respondents said they preferred using digital payments. The European Central Bank said in November that a majority of people in the Euro area used cash when paying for goods and services in 2016 \u2014 especially for small-value items below 15 euros ($17.62). Still, in recent years, new forms of online payments have emerged, including mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies. show chapters Our merchants not interested in crypto\u2014it's too volatile: PayPal CFO 7:17 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 01:06 But the move away from cash will take time and it would be the \"digital natives\" \u2014 people born after 1980 \u2014 who would lead the change, according to Shivananda. \"Their primary mode of interaction with everything in the world is digital,\" he said. Even then, it would not be easy to dislodge cash from society and move solely to digital payments, according to David Ng, a principal at investment firm B Capital Group's Singapore office. \"Cash is going to be around for a bit, especially in many emerging markets,\" Ng told CNBC. He explained that in many countries, it's not easy to obtain credit or debit cards, or use digital payment platforms. But a systematic push from governments and the availability of good digital payment platforms, like WeChat Pay and M-Pesa, might drive more people toward cashless transactions, he said. Even then, \"consumers will still choose a hybrid of both,\" he added. Convincing consumers to switch There are three things that payments companies must do to convince people to make the jump from using cash to digital payments, according to Shivananda. \"Security is definitely number one,\" he said. \"Privacy is number two and reliability is number three.\" With cash, most transactions happen directly between a buyer and a seller and, therefore, is usually both secure and private. But with digital payments, users would want to know that, not only is their money secure, but the way they spend is also kept private, Shivananda explained. That becomes a fine line which digital payments companies have to tread, because one benefit of digital payments include the ability for businesses to collect data that can give them insights into customer behavior. Being a reliable payments service is therefore a competitive advantage for companies, said the experts. \"It is often hard for consumers and merchants to distinguish who has a better technology,\" B Capital's Ng said. \"But they will make their judgment based on ease of use, performance and network.\" Protecting users' trust Fraudulent online transactions, data breach and privacy issues would likely erode user trust in digital payments and other financial technology \u2014 or fintech \u2014 services, according to experts. Scott Galit, CEO of Payoneer, a payments processing company based in New York, added that some fintech companies today underestimate issues surrounding regulation, risk and compliance. That may potentially increase the risk of events, such as a cyber attack, where consumer trust is destroyed because a start-up did not follow anti-money laundering procedures, according to Galit. \"Overall, I think there's too much tech, not enough fin,\" he said, adding, \"Most of the people that get into this don't come from the financial services side. They come at it with a 'oh, I can be a disruptor' [and] use technology to do some cool stuff.\" WATCH: PayPal CFO on mobile opportunity show chapters PayPal CFO sees opportunity in consumers who have mobile devices, but not bank accounts 1:23 PM ET Thu, 17 May 2018 | 09:06 ", "author": "Matt Cardy | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/cash-is-still-the-biggest-threat-for-digital-payments-firms-paypal-cto.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Matt Cardy", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Cash", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Sri Shivananda", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Shivananda", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Capgemini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "BNP Paribas", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2020", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "about 726 billion", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Last August", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Asia", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The European Central Bank", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "November", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Euro area", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "15", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "17.62", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "recent years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PayPal CFO 7:17 PM ET", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "16", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1980", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Shivananda", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "David Ng", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "B Capital Group's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Singapore", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "WeChat Pay", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Shivananda", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Privacy", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "number two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "number three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Shivananda", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Scott Galit", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Payoneer", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Galit", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PayPal CFO", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "1:23 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "17", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "There are three things that payments companies must do to convince people to make the jump from using cash to digital payments, according to Sri Shivananda, senior vice president and chief technology officer at PayPal.", "title": "Cash is still king even as digital payments are set to rise, says PayPal CTO", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/21/105220540-GettyImages-860933814.jpg?v=1526892859"}, {"time": "2018-05-23T13:33:58-0400", "body": " .embedPlayer_container iframe{width:100%} @media screen and (max-width: 640px){ .embedPlayer_container iframe { height: -webkit-calc(100vw * 9/16); height: -moz-calc(100vw * 9/16); height: calc(100vw * 9/16); } } Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari is speaking on the state of the economy, trade and labor markets before the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismark, North Dakota on Wednesday. Kashkari's comments came as investors digested the latest meeting minutes from the Fed's policymaking committee. Currently a non-voting Fed member, Kashkari has historically been dovish when considering hikes to the federal funds rate. Following the May meeting, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said it wasn't raising rates yet but added the word \"symmetric\" to describe its inflation goal. Until now, market participants have debated what that language meant.

Deutsche Bank will \"sharply\" reduce its presence in the U.S. as the German bank dials down its global equities trading business, according to reports Wednesday. The Frankfurt-based lender plans to significantly scale back its presence in the U.S. market and has already started slowing down activity in Central Europe and the Middle East and Africa region, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. At its annual shareholder meeting Thursday, the bank will reportedly announce additional restructuring measures. show chapters Deutsche Bank needs a change of strategy, needs more clarity on costs: Pro 8:56 AM ET Thu, 3 May 2018 | 03:56 Executives are also closing in on previously announced plans to cut roughly 10 percent of staff that will likely extend into next year as the bank accelerates cost cuts, Dow Jones reported. Following its first-quarter earnings report, the bank had announced plans to significantly reduce its workforce through the rest of this year, mostly in corporate and investment bank functions. U.S. shares of the bank fell 2 percent following the reports, and have lost nearly one-third their value this year. The stock traded at its lowest level since 2016, when a major crisis of confidence hit the bank. Deutsche Bank has been under scrutiny from shareholders for posting three consecutive years of losses, including a 497 million euro loss for 2017. In the first quarter, Deutsche Bank posted first-quarter net profits of 120 million euros, or $146 million, a 79 percent fall from last year's figure. In April, Chief Executive Officer John Cryan was ousted in a rocky transition that shook investor and employee confidence. His successor, Christian Sewing, the fourth CEO in six years, has signaled that the bank will scale back its business that deals with hedge funds, and the trading of stocks will also be affected, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The company had already announced large-scale restructuring to focus on direct links with European companies, and said it plans to scale back U.S. rates sales and trading, which would result in significant job losses, the bank said. Two executives are also reportedly leaving the bank: London-based head of CEEMEA equity sales Darren Veenhuis, and Pascal Moura, who heads up equity research in Dubai. The bank declined CNBC's request for comment.

It's a mixed bag \u2013 a green energy developer, a shoemaker, a telecom equipment manufacturer and a port on the border with North Korea. But the businesses all have one thing in common: they're among a rash of bond defaulters that has players wondering whether a day of debt reckoning in China's US$2.8 trillion onshore corporate bond market is finally dawning. At least 20 corporate bond defaults have occurred in China so far this year, with the latest coming on Monday from CEFC Shanghai, the troubled Shanghai-based energy conglomerate controlled by tycoon Ye Jianming. More from the South China Morning Post: CEFC defaults on 2 billion yuan of bonds as fallen oligarch's asset-buying firm goes rudderless China's private firms default on US$2 billion bond repayments as Beijing's deleveraging efforts bite How Trump's obsession with China could turn America into Japan China had 15 corporate bond defaults in the first four months of this year, involving a combined 12.9 billion yuan (US$2 billion), or a third more in value than the same time last year, according to China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing, the official source for bond data. The defaults continued in May. While the amounts are a drop in the bucket of the overall industry, analysts said defaults were set to grow this year and beyond as China's central bank tightened up on monetary policy. Observers said the tightening would make it more expensive and harder for Chinese corporate borrowers to get funds from investors. There are signs that this could already be happening. On Monday, Shenzhen-listed gardening firm Beijing Orient Landscape and Environment said in its exchange filing that it had planned to raise 1 billion yuan by selling bonds with an annual coupon of 7 per cent but it only managed to raise 50 million yuan from investors. Christopher Lee, managing director of S&P's corporate rating department in Hong Kong, said corporate defaults in China were set to grow and spread from private businesses to state firms. \"[China's] deleveraging campaign is affecting the liquidity [of borrowers who] relied on shadow banking channels for funding,\" Lee said. With control of financial risks a top national priority, the People's Bank of China is putting the squeeze on shadow banking, ending a decade of financial exuberance where debts could be easily rolled over and defaults were rare. Vice-Premier Liu He, one of President Xi Jinping's top economic aides, told a gathering of political advisers last week that wrongdoings must be corrected. \"You can't borrow all the money for your business. Debt must be repaid, investors must shoulder risks and wrongdoers must pay a price,\" he was quoted by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying. Most of the 21 defaulters so far this year have been private businesses but there have been signs of debt stress in the publicly traded sector, too. Tianjin Real Estate, a property developer backed by the municipality of Tianjin, was set to miss a 200 million yuan repayment to a trust investment plan due on May 18, with the trust product's manager, China Citic Trust, issuing a warning to investors on May 10. The developer came through with the cash at the last minute but it still has a debt mountain of over 180 billion yuan. Li Yang, director general of the National Institution of Finance and Development, a state-backed think tank, said that investors were reluctant to buy corporate bonds because the coupons were \"inadequate to cover risks\". Li, a former adviser to the central bank, said Beijing was now determined to deleverage. \"The previous logic was that we must drive up GDP growth in times [of financial stress],\" he said. \"Now the central government has great determination [to reduce financial risks at the cost of short-term growth].\" Peng Xingyun, a senior monetary policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the central bank might follow the US Federal Reserve in raising market rates, a change that would make it even harder for borrowers to honour their debts. \"The US Fed rates have become an anchor since Beijing made the yuan exchange rate a higher priority,\" Peng said. But Brokerage house China Everbright Securities argued in a note on Tuesday that the ongoing bond defaults in China were caused by regulation more than economic fundamentals. \"This wave of defaults is a result of credit crunch caused by enhanced regulation,\" China Everbright said. \"The wave will retreat in about a quarter.\" Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

According to Yale University senior fellow Stephen Roach, the threat is still real, and it could take a big bite out of stocks. \"The bottom line is China has been one of President Trump's core economic issues, and I'd be surprised if he just capitulates on this,\" Roach told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Wednesday. \"We have to look at the risk of some type of trade tensions very seriously.\" Roach, who was Morgan Stanley Asia chairman for five years, said it's hard to have confidence in White House trade policy when Trump administration officials are constantly changing their minds. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that trade talks with China have yielded \"very meaningful progress.\" About 24 hours later, President Donald Trump contradicted Mnuchin \u2014 declaring he wasn't satisfied with the recent trade discussions. \"The Treasury secretary says one thing, one day. And, the president says something the next day,\" Roach said. \"It's, sort of, back and forth in terms of getting clear and direct messages in what to make of this.\" Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on China as retaliation for a mammoth trade imbalance and alleged thefts of U.S intellectual property. Roach doesn't think the White House approach would be effective. \"Tariffs are a bad thing. Trade wars are not easy to win, as the president seems to suggest,\" he added. Roach warned it could have dire consequences for a stock market that's already vulnerable to another steep pullback. \"We had a valuation spike early this year.

Don't want to run persistently above 2% target 8:39 AM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 06:20 The Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates about four more times before it reaches an equilibrium level, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Thursday. Speaking a day after the central bank released minutes from its May meeting, Kaplan said the Fed still has work to do before it can say it has its benchmark funds rate at a level that is considered \"neutral\" for growth. \"My own view is we should be raising rates until we get to neutral,\" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas. \"We should do it gradually. I'm not prepared to say yet I want to go above neutral.\" The release of the minutes moved markets Wednesday afternoon, likely on commentary out of the meeting summary that indicated the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, of which Kaplan is a nonvoting member, is willing to let inflation run a bit hotter than normal as the economy continues in recovery phase. That could mean the Fed will take a more dovish approach to policy, holding off on raising rates even if inflation climbs above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Kaplan said he is in the camp that would be willing to let conditions heat up a bit. \"I want to run around 2, and if we got a little bit above it and I thought it would be short term and not long term, I could tolerate it,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"If I thought it would persist I think it would affect my policy views.\" On top of the increase already approved in March, market participants widely expect the Fed to hike its benchmark rate a quarter point in June, followed by another move in September. However, traders have sharply pared back expectations for a fourth move in December. Last week, the market saw chances of a fourth increase above 50 percent; that fell to just above 40 percent as of Thursday morning. Fed officials have been discussing where they might reach a \"neutral\" rate that is neither stimulative nor restrictive. Kaplan said he estimates that it's between 2.5 percent and 2.75 percent, compared with the 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent current target range. On a separate matter, Kaplan said he is watching conditions in emerging economies such as Turkey and Argentina and the effects that Fed rate increases have in those parts of the world. He said that Fed tightening could trigger restraints on capital flows. \"If that gets pronounced enough, that could lead to a rapid tightening in conditions in the United States, which in turn could slow the economy,\" he said. He spoke before President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of his summit with North Korea. Richmond Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC the development \"a surprise\" and part of \"downside risks\" for the economy.

Heitkamp: Bank reform bill puts community banks back in the mortgage lending business 8:05 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 02:07 Small and regional banks are the big beneficiaries of the House-approved bank regulatory relief bill making its way to President Donald Trump's desk for signature this week. The bill, which passed the House on Tuesday evening by about 100 votes, cuts dozens of large regional lenders off the list of banks considered too big to fail and frees all but the biggest banks from required annual stress testing by regulators. It is seen as a victory for the banking industry, which has been pushing back at the restrictions since the financial-crisis era Dodd-Frank rules were enacted in 2010. \"I see this as allowing banks to be banks again,\" said Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James. Immediately, banks with assets that fall below $100 billion, such as Dallas-based Comerica, Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp and San Francisco's First Republic, lose the systemically important designation and won't have to submit to stress tests by the Federal Reserve or adhere to higher capital requirements. The previous threshold was $50 billion. The Fed reserves the discretion to enforce higher standards on banks above that threshold. In 18 months, when that threshold is raised to $250 billion, major regional lenders such as BB&T, SunTrust and FifthThird, will also fall off the too-big-to-fail list. The number of banks that remain on the list, facing the harshest restrictions, drops to 12 from 38 under the new rules. Those big banks still deemed systemically important include J. P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. The market has anticipated the moves. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking index (KRX) is up 8 percent this year, and the bigger-bank index, the KBW Bank index, is up 3 percent. \"For the first time in nearly a decade, lawmakers from both parties have chosen to right-size financial rules that were not working as intended and holding the economy back,\" Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement. Raymond James' Mills said the effect of the bill could be more lending by smaller banks, which have been wary of adding assets that would put them over the old Dodd-Frank thresholds. \"We will see more risk-taking,\" he said, such as a possible increase in bank lending to construction companies. Banks may take back some of the lending that has been getting done by nondeposit-taking firms, such as real estate investment trusts, he added. The bill also exempts banks with less than $10 billion of assets from restrictions on trading for themselves, a controversial provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. But it does leave other Republican bugaboos in place, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Democrats had pledged to abandon the bill if it cut that agency out, even though the administration has worked to weaken its powers. The Senate passed the bill in March. Tuesday night's vote in the House was 258 to 159, opposed by one Republican and 158 Democrats. It is the first significant change to Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in response to the financial crisis, when big banks were cast as the villains that nearly brought down the U.S. financial system.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A farmer unloads harvested corn in Marshall, Missouri. U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co. is set for upside as rising grain prices spur a cycle of equipment replacement across the globe, according to UBS. Analyst Steven Fisher, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, also told clients that a potential dividend increase and a strong earnings performance this summer could prove lucrative for shareholders. \"We think the slow recovery in Deere's large agricultural business could accelerate in fiscal year 2019 with higher grain prices, which have a favorable set-up entering the growing season,\" Fisher said in a note Thursday. \"We think higher grain prices would stimulate a recovery in North American high-horsepower tractors, which have been declining for five years.\" In addition to the burgeoning demand for tractor equipment, UBS believes Deere will raise its dividend 21 percent in fiscal 2018 to a 30 percent payout ratio. Assuming the company continues to return 50 percent to 60 percent of its operating cash to shareholders, Fisher said, Deere will have $1.25 billion in cash flow left over to buy back shares. The equipment maker upgraded its sales outlook earlier in the year, citing stronger conditions in its agricultural and construction markets. For the past four years, Deere has been struggling against weaker demand for farm equipment as global oversupplies kept a lid on prices. \"Given the recovery ongoing in 2018 and management's expectation that operating cash flow will grow 56 percent year over year, we think it is very likely that Deere could raise its dividend and continue to buy back shares,\" Fisher said. The expectation of shareholder-friendly activity prompted Fisher to increase his 12-month price target on Deere's stock to $185 from $175, implying 18 percent upside over the next year. Shares of the Moline, Illinois-based company are largely unchanged since January, though they're up more than 13 percent in the past month and are 2 percent higher in early trading Thursday.

Goldman Sachs made $200 million in profit on a single day this February as calm in stock markets was shattered with a historic surge in volatility, according to people with knowledge of the move. That's on par with what the firm's derivatives unit typically makes in an entire year, said the people. The investment bank had positioned itself to benefit if the Cboe Volatility Index, the product sometimes called the \"fear index\" because it reflects expectations of future volatility, climbed, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about internal matters. After months of tranquil markets, on Feb. 5 the VIX surged 116 percent, the biggest one-day move on record, as the S&P 500 plunged 4.1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 1,100 points. Source: CNBC As a result, Goldman's hedge fund and asset management clients clamored for VIX exposure on the chance it would climb further, and the New York-based bank's positions were suddenly highly profitable. It was a boon for Goldman's flow derivatives group, run by managing director David Casner, who joined in 2002. The business, a team within Goldman's larger equities division that trades securities like VIX options, had been stung in recent years by calm markets and regulation. During all of last year, the bank's entire trading business exceeded $100 million in revenue on just four days, the company said in February. Pushing for No. 1 Driven by their recent performance and investments in trading technology that are starting to pay off, Goldman equities executives are optimistic they can regain the No. 1 ranking they have ceded to rival Morgan Stanley by year-end, according to the sources. J.P. Morgan Chase has also made gains against Goldman in recent years, a move that the investment bank's traders are eager to counter. Goldman's volatility bet helped fuel the 38 percent increase in first-quarter equities trading revenue to $2.3 billion, exceeding the increase by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan. The firm is known for managing risks well, but such trading moves aren't without potential hazards. If the market had gone the other way, they were exposed to losses, similar to wrong-way bets in commodities that stung Goldman in 2017. Perhaps with his recent equity performance in mind, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein defended his bank's beleaguered trading business when he spoke at a conference later in February. \"I don't think it would be a good strategic move to forgo the upside in the business from here,\" Blankfein said. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

But Chen pointed out that some cost-cutting measures may affect margins, which in turn affects investors. The analyst said jewelry brands such as Tiffany can leverage prices to get better returns for investors. \"Grocery, food, apparel, where there's less differentiation, that becomes a problem, and people compete on price,\" the analyst said. \"And that's a big factor for retail over the long term, especially with Amazon and others,\" Chen said. \"Competing on the basis of price is very competitive.\" In fact, Tiffany's success may be in part because it is \"un-Amazonable,\" Chen said, referring to experiences that can't be bought online.

Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April. The digital currency dropped 8.7 percent to a low of $7,512.43 as of 12:30 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk. All other major cryptocurrencies were also in the red despite bullish callsthat prices would skyrocket after a week of major blockchain events in New York City. Analysts at Fundstrat predicted bitcoin would rally as much as 69 percent as a result of \"Blockchain Week,\" yet the cryptocurrency has fallen about 13 percent since those conferences kicked off. Some pundits pointed to regulatory news as the key driver of this week's sell-off. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announceda widespread crackdown on some cryptocurrency investment schemes, led by the North American Securities Administrators Association. More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in what's being called \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far. \"This cleaned out a lot of the bad projects,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies. \"That has people a little concerned, and is a short-term hit to sentiment.\" Long-term though, Kelly said it's part of the maturation this market needs for institutional investors to buy in. \"The projects that they shut down they appear to be junk, they had a real reason to shut them down,\" Kelly said. Unlike stock markets, the nascent cryptocurrency market typically takes a few days to digest news before it triggers a sell-off, Kelly said. This week's crackdown comes amid growing attention in the U.S. to cryptocurrency scams by U.S. regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several fraud casesagainst operators of initial coin offerings and last week launcheda website to help investors recognize scams. Bitcoin has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year, after an epic 1,300 percent rise to near $20,000 in 2017. The top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also sold off significantly Wednesday. Ethereum dropped 13 percent, XRP was down 11 percent and bitcoin cash fell 14 percent. Jack Tatar, co-author of \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,\" said this sell-off could be a sign that a shakeout is coming for digital currencies. \"I think you're going to start to see some consolidation around many of the smaller cryptoassets,\" Tatar said. \"That may not be a bad thing for the overall crypto community as I'm seeing more critical examination of altcoins, their utility and overall value.\" ", "author": "Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-drops-9-percent-now-back-below-8000.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Jaap Arriens", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "NurPhoto", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bydgoszcz", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Poland", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "two-week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "8,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "mid April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "8.7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "7,512.43", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "12:30 p.m. ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "a week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "New York City", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Fundstrat", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "as much as 69 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "about 13 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "More than 40", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Operation Crypto-Sweep", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "at least 70", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Brian Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "BKCM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a few days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The Securities and Exchange Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "nearly 40 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1,300 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "ten", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "13 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "XRP", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "11 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "14 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Jack Tatar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "The Innovative Investor's Guide", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Beyond", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April.", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/15/104901516-GettyImages-892695698-bitcoin.jpg?v=1513350687"}, {"time": "2018-05-24T13:08:45-0400", "body": " show chapters Fed's Bostic: Want to see how the economy works at neutral 11:35 AM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 05:17 Geopolitical turmoil and policy certainty are combining to make businesses more cautious about investing, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Thursday. With nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea breaking down, the central bank leader said the development was \"a surprise\" and part of \"downside risks\" for the economy. \"Uncertainty has its own contribution,\" Bostic told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas, where Fed officials were attending a conference on disruption and technology. \"Then we actually have to ... figure out what the policy ends up being. If the policy turns out in certain ways, then business can go forward.\" Markets reacted negatively to the morning news, with the Dow industrials down about 200 points and government bond yields down substantially as well. In a letter to Kim Jung Un, Trump said that recent rhetoric from North Korea made a summit impossible at this point. Trump also announced possible new tariffs on imported vehicles to the U.S. even as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier this week said a trade war with China had been averted at least for the moment. \"You're at the fork in the road, and there are multiple ways you can go,\" Bostic said. \"What I'm hearing from business is we're going to wait and we're going to see what happens, and I think that will offset some of the impact.\" On other matters, Bostic said he thinks the Fed is getting close to the end of its rate-hiking cycle. The so-called neutral rate, he said, is probably around 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent, which would imply three to five more increases in the Fed's benchmark funds rate. The comments came a day after the Federal Open Market Committee, of which Bostic is a voting member, released minutes from a meeting earlier this month that indicated officials are comfortable with letting inflation run a little hot for a short period as the economy grows. \"For me, I think we get to the neutral and we let the economy work,\" Bostic said.

Top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would acquire trading platform Paradex in the start-up's latest attempt to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive crypto economy. The San Francisco-based company, which landed at the No. 10 spot on the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, is also overhauling its flagship trading platform GDAX designed for professional investors. GDAX and the new product, Coinbase Pro, will exist side-by-side until June 29 when all customers will be rolled over to the newer version. Paradex will be integrated into that new product in the coming weeks, the company said. \"This will significantly enhance the proposition for our customers in terms of what they want to trade and how they want to trade it,\" Asiff Hirji, Coinbase president and chief operating officer told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. show chapters Coinbase launches new products for retail & institutional crypto investors 6:41 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 09:30 A key distinction between Paradex and other exchanges is that it does not hold tokens on behalf of its customers. Users instead trade peer-to-peer, directly from their own \"wallets.\" Coinbase in contrast, acts as a trusted custodian for digital assets on its exchange. \"This peer-to-peer trading removes the need for third-party custodianship and the associated security risks,\" Coinbase said in a blog post. \"It is another step toward creating a truly decentralized crypto economy.\" Paradex's platform offers hundreds of digital tokens for trading, while Coinbase notoriously only offers four. Initially, only customers outside of the U.S. will have access to the new exchange but Coinbase said it's \"actively working toward\" regulatory clearance for the product in the U.S. \"As soon as we can we're going to turn it on in the U.S,\" Hirji said. \"We're greatly increasing the number of things you can trade and we're doing it in a compliant way.\" Some U.S. exchanges have been cautious about listing ICO tokens because of concerns that they might be considered unregistered securities and could require platforms that list them to be licensed by regulators. In March the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors that platforms offering trading of digital assets that are securities and operate as an \"exchange\" must register with regulators. Hirji said Coinbase would like to list \"as many assets as possible,\" but despite increased discussions with regulators, the company has not gotten increased guidance. \"As soon as there is more clarity we will list them as long as they adhere to our framework,\" Hirji said. \"But clarity is needed and I don't think we're close to that unfortunately.\" Coinbase has traded $150 billion in assets for more than 20 million customers and had a reported revenue last year of $1 billion as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed. While the company is best known as the leading U.S. cryptocurrency trading platform, Coinbase has been pouring money into plans to stay ahead in a larger cryptocurrency economy. The company is looking to lure institutional investors, a group that have been especially careful when entering the volatile cryptocurrency market. Coinbase launched four new products last week: Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Markets, The Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group and Coinbase Prime to cater to the \"white glove\" investors. Like GDAX, Coinbase Pro customers will have access the single pool of liquidity shared by all Coinbase products.

While it hasn't been exactly rosy for the company \u2014 with sales weighed down by challenges so far, and a slow entry into e-commerce, Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners, believes that things are looking up. \"There's just a myriad of opportunities here to generate value,\" Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners told CNBC. His firm owns 3.4 percent of the company's outstanding shares. \"More importantly, we see a business, over the next year or two, that could rapidly turn around produce profits of a dollar or maybe even $2 per share, again roughly on just under $3 per share base here,\" Miller said on \"Closing Bell\" Wednesday. Destination Maternity has a market cap of just $43 million, while stock prices have declined 75 percent over three years, or 90 percent since 2011. \"I think that points to the value destruction that's gone on by the past management and the past board of this company,\" Miller said. Management changes, reduced mall traffic and changes in the retail industry have all contributed to the company's diminished sales. The maternity apparel company has also been slow to enter the e-commerce market, manage its inventory and sales, general and administrative expenses have been \"exceptionally high,\" Miller said. \"The biggest thing that went awry was just their strategy on cost-control,\" Miller said. Destination Maternity would not respond to a request for comment. But Miller said the company's \"online piece is growing very rapidly right now. We see opportunity for them to consolidate three brands.\" The company, which is parent to A Pea in the Pod and Motherhood Maternity, made headlines Wednesday over a proxy battle to determine whether prior board experience should preclude women from obtaining future board seats. In the company's 25-year history there have been only three female directors. Shareholders, including Gullane Capital Partners, voted in favor of the female-dominated board. Shares fell 2.5 percent after Wednesday's vote. But Miller is optimistic. \"This is a company run for women and it needs to be run by women,\" he said. \"So we're very excited to see three new female board members.\" \"Change was inevitable here, we believe,\" Miller said.

The industrial conglomerate is down about 47 percent from 12 months ago. It also cut its dividend in half in November. \"It's got a great mix of a whole bunch of portfolio companies,\" said Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers' Retirement System. GE is part of CalSTRS' portfolio, which had $224.7 billion in total investment assets as of April 30. On Wednesday, GE dropped the most in a single day of trading since April 2009 after CEO John Flannery said the company will \"have to see how\" the turnaround plan \"plays out\" before deciding whether to cut the company's dividend again. However, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday that GE does not plan to cut its dividend in 2019. Flannery's remarks may have been misinterpreted, according to those sources. Ailman told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday that while GE has been one of the laggards in the Dow Jones industrial average, the future looks optimistic. \"We think it's going to improve in value over time,\" he said. \"The dividend is important but it is not critical. It is more important for the pensioners but for us as a shareholder, we're interested in the total return of the stock.\" Meanwhile, he thinks Flannery, who took the helm of the beleaguered company in August, is off to a good start. \"He needs to continue to diversify the board. We'd like to see more outside ideas come into that board because there's such a diverse set of product mix,\" said Ailman. \"One of the challenges for Wall Street is trying to figure out what exactly GE is.\" However, he anticipates a trying time ahead for the new CEO. That's because GE is a \"giant, giant battleship.\" \"When you're a huge ship in this ocean, trying to figure out how to navigate this world, he's going to have challenges in front of him. We're going to give him some time to see how he performs,\" Ailman added.

A U.S. recession probably won't happen for another two years, and in the meantime stocks are a good bet, according to closely followed Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Garthwaite. \"We conclude that a US recession is unlikely until Q3 2020,\" Garthwaite wrote in a note to clients Friday. \"Remain overweight equities.\" Typically, an inverted yield curve, when longer-term interest rates dip below shorter-term rates, and full employment with wage growth at 3.5 percent happen about a year before a recession. Garthwaite predicted those phenomena wouldn't hit the U.S. until halfway through 2019. Based on that timing and historical behavior, stocks could keep rising until 2020. In the past 50 years, with the exception of 1987, when the equity risk premium hit a very low 1 percent, \"equities have never peaked more than 13 months ahead of a recession,\" he said. High volatility is also here to stay, meaning credit is riskier than equity, Garthwaite said. He told clients to sell and \"remain cautious\" on highly leveraged companies with low free cash flow, such as GlaxoSmithKline. But the Credit Suisse analyst is not bullish on all sectors. Garthwaite suggested staying underweight non-financial cyclicals such as consumer discretionary, materials and industrials, calling them \"expensive\" and \"over-owned.\" He instead favors lowly leveraged defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, health care and telecoms. \"At this stage of yield curve flattening, normally software and energy are the best performing sectors, while consumer staples and utilities perform the worst,\" Garthwaite said.

Following the May 1-2 session, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said it wasn't raising rates yet but added the word \"symmetric\" to describe its inflation goal. Market participants since have puzzled over what the change in language might imply. The summary released Wednesday indicates a substantial level of debate over how the Fed should approach inflation. The minutes also pointed to an interest rate hike at the June meeting amid debate over how close the Fed might be getting to the end of this rate-hiking cycle. Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference March 21, 2018 in Washington, DC. While the general sentiment was that inflation would continue to rise toward the 2 percent target, there was disagreement over how confident the Fed should be after years of undershooting, and what that would mean to policy. However, there seemed to be agreement that after years of subpar growth and low inflation, allowing the economy to rev up a little would be appropriate. \"A few participants commented that recent news on inflation, against a background of continued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth, supported the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move slightly above the Committee's 2 percent objective for a time,\" the minutes said. \"It was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee's symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.\" 'Symmetric' \"Symmetric\" was mentioned at least nine times in the minutes. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures index, currently is at 1.9 percent, while the headline rate including energy and food prices is at 2 percent. Fed officials described wage pressures as \"moderate\" though it noted there has been more pressure in industries where labor supply is tightening. Fed officials see 2 percent inflation as a level that sustains economic growth without putting too much upward pressure on prices. After seven years of keeping its benchmark interest rate near zero, the FOMC began raising rates in December 2015, with the current target range at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. As the economy has seen growth above its recovery trend and inflation inches its way toward the Fed's goal, market participants have been speculating on how quickly the Fed will continue to hike and when it will stop. A few members stated that the Fed is getting close to its \"neutral\" goal of setting a rate that is neither constrictive nor overly expansionary to growth. Though Fed officials indicated in March that a total of three rate hikes this year were likely, traders in the fed funds futures market in recent days briefly put chances of a fourth hike above 50 percent. That probability has since declined to about 43 percent. The minutes indicate that central bank officials remain determined to keep increasing rates, but with the gradual approach that it has repeatedly pledged to take. June hike? \"Most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate for the Committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation,\" the minutes said in an indication that another hike is likely soon. Markets already had been pricing in a 95 percent chance of a quarter-point move at the June FOMC session, followed by another increase in September. The Fed's rate is tied closely to most forms of consumer debt. Along with the approach to inflation, some Fed officials also suggested that changes will be coming to what has become boilerplate language in post-meeting statements. Specifically, those members said that as rate hikes continue, adjustments may have to be made to phrasing that the \"federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run\" and another phrase that for years has said \"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\" However, the minutes also noted that members \"expressed a range of views\" on how policy should proceed. Positive economic outlook On the economy, committee members said their opinions had changed little as they expect continued progress despite some signs of softening in the first quarter. There was concern expressed over trade and fiscal issues, with Fed business contacts expressing \"concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and trade restrictions, including the potential for postponing or pulling back on capital spending.\" The outlook otherwise was positive. \"They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad,\" the minutes said. As things progress, \"further gradual increases\" in rates would be possible without disrupting the recovery and while sustaining the \"symmetric\" inflation goal.

The five biggest U.S. banks claimed 62 percent of global revenues, while seven European firms shared the rest, according to Coalition's data. That gap was the widest since at least 2012, showing that European firms have been steadily losing ground.

Banking regulation has gotten stricter and more transparent in the days since the financial crisis, though more adjustments are likely ahead, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday. The central bank chief cited stress testing as one particular area where openness has both helped stabilize the financial system and given the public more confidence that institutions are prepared for the next crisis. \"In the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system,\" Powell said in a speech delivered in Stockholm at the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, on the past and future of central banking, according to prepared remarks. show chapters Powell 'very clear' on rates, says economist 9:23 AM ET Mon, 9 April 2018 | 03:28 Stress tests \"have placed special demands on transparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the public. The framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to new ways to enhance transparency and accountability.\" His speech did not delve into monetary policy and offered no clues as to how he feels about where interest rates are headed. Instead, Powell reviewed the progress made since the financial crisis exploded in 2008. He said the new rules come amid \"a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions in many places around the world.\" Since the crisis, regulators have required banks to carry increased capital levels and to lessen their risk-taking. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a bill that rolls back some of those regulations, largely in an effort to make the rules less onerous for regional and community banks. Powell largely praised the post-crisis steps, though he said progress has to continue in reviewing the rules to make sure they're working as intended. \"At the Fed, we are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis reforms,\" he said. \"The post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar. Some of these new policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and challenging for all involved. As a result, transparency and accountability around financial stability tools present particular challenges.\" Powell promised to continue to review how the regulatory framework is communicated to the public and banks. \"While future innovations may well improve the delivery of financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of potential future systemic vulnerabilities. We will need to keep up with the pace of innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability,\" he said.

The US's banks have largely sat out the mergers and acquisitions wave of recent years. While deal records have fallen in almost every other sector, big banks have done almost nothing, shrinking rather than expanding. And merger activity among small and mid-sized banks \u2014 some 5,607 of them, at last count \u2014 has been subdued. But when Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati revealed its $4.7bn swoop for Chicago's MB Financial on Monday morning, shares in other Chicago-area banks began to move, too. Wintrust, a similar-sized bank based in Rosemont, Illinois, ended the day up almost 4 per cent, while First Midwest of Itasca closed up 3 per cent. The implications were obvious: after years of thin activity in bank M&A, this deal could mark a turn. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The conditions for dealmaking look better than at any time since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates and lower taxes have pumped up bank profits, giving management teams stronger platforms from which to contemplate doing something radical. Data released on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that net income across the banking industry rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter, to a record $56bn. Shareholder activists have also begun to flex their muscles, calling for fresh ways to boost returns at Ally Financial, Comerica, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Regions Financial, among others. And then \u2014 most importantly \u2014 there is the shifting regulatory landscape. For much of the post-crisis period, agencies generally frowned on any transaction that might make a bank bigger, more complex and tougher to police. Several proposed combinations were abandoned because regulators took too long to approve them, among them New York Community Bancorp's bid for Astoria Financial and Investors Bancorp's move on The Bank of Princeton. A $5.3bn tie-up between M&T Bank of New York and Hudson City Bancorp of New Jersey took more than three years to limp over the finish line. Now, under the administration of Donald Trump, there are clear signs that attitude is changing. Last year, the Federal Reserve made it easier for banks to merge by lifting the combined size threshold that would trigger a much deeper regulatory probe, from $25bn in assets to $100bn. On top of that, the Fed is considering a change to the way it grades banks' management teams, moving from a five-point to a four-point scale. In practice, said Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell, that may mean many managers will be bumped up from a grade 3 (\"less than satisfactory\") to a grade 2 (\"satisfactory\"). In the past, a three-rating has been an effective bar on doing deals, keeping many would-be acquirers on the sidelines. Another spur to consolidation comes with the new bank-relief bill passed on Tuesday by Congress, which is set to free small and mid-sized lenders from many of the restraints that apply to the trillion-dollar banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. What does the new bank-relief law change? Financial stability regulation: Raises the size threshold at which the strictest supervision kicks in from $50bn in assets to $250bn. Volcker rule and bank capital requirements: Exempts small banks with assets of under $10bn from the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading. Mortgage lending rules: Makes it easier for small banks to offer mortgages by increasing legal protection and reducing data requirements. The most obvious \"winners\" are regional banks in the $50bn-in-assets to $100bn bracket, said Quyen Truong, a Washington-based partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. She noted that such banks now find themselves freed from all of the Fed's \"enhanced prudential standards\" \u2014 tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test. Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets will still face periodic stress tests, but will be exempted from other tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill's enactment. All of which suggests that more bank acquisitions are likely. \"I think we are at a potential real tipping point,\" said Mr Cohen. \"You've got positive incentives to do deals, and the removal of obstacles to do deals.\" The one caveat, for now, is the valuations of bank stocks. Shares in Fifth Third slumped the most in almost two years on Monday, down 8 per cent, after investors turned their nose up at the MB deal. In particular, they criticised the meagre 2 per cent boost to earnings per share next year \u2014 even with some very aggressive assumptions on cost-cutting \u2014 and the projection it will take seven years to overcome the hit to tangible book value, which is much longer than the three to five years that is normal for bank acquisitions, according to M&A bankers. Chris Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique, said Fifth Third may have been bounced into a deal, following rumours of interest in MB from other potential acquirers last week. Two of the banks linked to MB, US Bancorp and Bank of Montreal, declined to comment. Fifth Third's share price slide was \"clearly a wake-up call\" for other potential acquirers, said Mr Marinac. \"You've got to have your transaction buttoned up and with a quicker payback period.\" If dealmaking does begin to pick up, investors may ultimately look more kindly on banks that move early rather than miss out on potential partners. On Tuesday, Fifth Third's stock recovered some of the lost ground, closing up 3 per cent.

One of the more hawkish central bankers when it comes to monetary policy, Harker said he envisions a scenario where the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark overnight rate three times total in 2018 and three more times next year, then stops as the economy hits equilibrium. \"I think we're getting close to neutral,\" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman in a live interview from Dallas. \"If we see inflation start to accelerate, then I would be open to a fourth increase this year. But I'd have to see evidence of that first.\" The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, of which Harker is a nonvoting member this year, approved a quarter-point rate hike in March and is widely expected to add another in June and one more in September. Whether the committee approves a fourth rate rise in December remains an open question, with traders currently assigning it a 39 percent chance. Policy doves, who favor lower rates, seemed to get a boost Wednesday, when minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting indicated that officials would be willing to let inflation run above the Fed's 2 percent target for a temporary period. Harker said he, too, would consider that, though it would depend on conditions. \"I don't think of it so much as a number around 2 percent, although that's part of it,\" he said during the \"Power Lunch\" interview. \"It's the acceleration or deceleration. If we're creeping up to 2 percent and we creep up to, say, 2.25 percent, that's a different story than [if] we're accelerating past 2 percent. I think we'd behave differently. At least I would as a policymaker.\" Fed officials were in Dallas for a conference on technology and disruption.

\"Looking at the last 20 years \u2014 all cases of higher interest rates have been met with a market that's gone higher,\" Miller said, according to notes from the call published May 15. He managed a fund at Legg Mason that beat the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years through 2005 before he founded Miller Value Partners in 2016. The opposite mentality has generally factored into daily market moves in recent years. Stocks fell earlier this year as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed toward 3 percent. Even on Wednesday, stocks closed higher after minutes from the latest Fed meeting said the central bank would be comfortable letting inflation temporarily run above the 2 percent target, a statement that caused yields to decline. But over the long term, Miller's analysis appears to be holding true. The S&P 500 is up more than 30 percent since the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in December 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade. Miller pointed out that: During the bull market of 1980, bond yields rose 210 basis points and the market was up 26 percent. In 1983, bond yields rose 146 basis points and the market was up 17 percent. In 1996, bond yields rose 85 basis points and the market gained 20 percent. In 2009, bond yields rose 160 basis points and the market gained 23 percent. In 2013, bond yields rose 126 basis points and the market rose 30 percent. He said the connection between higher yields and stock prices has become more complicated since the financial crisis. \"But overall, I think it looks like the market actually wants to go up.\" The S&P 500 is up more than 3 percent for the second quarter so far, and markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least two more times this year.

For example, Baird reiterated its outperform rating on Wednesday, predicting the Palo Alto, California-based automaker will make significant progress in its Model 3 output. The firm''s analyst, Ben Kallo, reaffirmed his $411 price target for Tesla shares, representing 48 percent upside to Thursday's close. \"Negative headlines have increased substantially in the past month and, in our opinion, increasingly immaterial reports have dominated news cycles,\" Kallo said in a note. \"We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment.\" German investment bank Berenberg also remained upbeat earlier this week, contending that Model 3 gross margins will \"positively surprise.\" The firm raised its price target for Tesla to $500 from $470, representing 80 percent upside to Thursday's close, predicting it will be able to meet its 25 percent gross profit margin forecast for the Model 3. The investment bank also reiterated its buy rating on the stock. Some analysts aren't convinced, however, including Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas. The analyst slashed his price target to $291 from $376 for Tesla shares last Tuesday, saying the firm is \"making material reductions to our earnings estimates to reflect lingering manufacturing issues.\" \"It is our view that the challenges in ramping up Model 3 production reflect fundamental issues of vehicle design, manufacturing process, and automation levels that can weigh against the profitability of the vehicle,\" Jonas wrote. Tesla's share price, which has declined nearly 11 percent this year, is closely related to Model 3 production. The percentage of Tesla's available stock currently sold short exceeds 30 percent, according to FactSet. Goldman Sachs isn't a fan, either. \"We believe the sustainable production rate for the second quarter of 2018 is most likely below the 2,000 vehicle mark the company achieved in the final week of the [first] quarter,\" Goldman analyst David Tamberrino wrote last month. \"We see the company likely sustaining Model 3 production around the 1,400 per week mark.\" Disclosure: Jon Najarian is a frequent guest on CNBC's \"Fast Money: Halftime Report.\" WATCH: Tesla's troubles continue show chapters Tesla's troubles continue 6:03 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 | 05:11 Disclaimer ", "author": "Joe Skipper | Reuters", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/tesla-is-near-the-top-of-list-of-stocks-that-wall-street-is-most-confused-about.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Joe Skipper", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Elon Musk", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "only two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Dish Network", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 800", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "more than $5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "500px;border", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Commenting", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Jon Najarian", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Najarian Family Office", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bill Ackman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Najarian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dish", "category": "LANGUAGE"}, {"term": "AT&T", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AT&T", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "4:30 AM ET Fri", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "25", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "02:50 Still", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "the past few weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Baird", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Palo Alto", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "California", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Ben Kallo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "411", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "48 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the past month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kallo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "German", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Berenberg", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "earlier this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Tesla to $500", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "470", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "80 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "25 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Morgan Stanley's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Adam Jonas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "291", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "376", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "last Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Jonas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "nearly 11 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "30 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "FactSet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the second quarter of 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the final week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Goldman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "David Tamberrino", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Jon Najarian", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fast Money: Halftime Report", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "6:03 PM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "21", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Analysts at the nation's top brokerages are divided on the trajectory of electric car maker Tesla.

According to Bianco Research President James Bianco, most economists mistakenly believe that leading indicators are signaling an \"A+\" economy that can withstand rising interest rates. \"It's more like a B- economy,\" he told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Friday. \"It's not this screaming home run that everybody thinks it is based on the survey data.\" Bianco said social media is creating the bandwagon effect among survey respondents, a psychological phenomenon characterized by people following the herd. \"The advent of social media is allowing us basically to be inundated with financial news or economic news,\" he said, adding the bulk of the news about the world's largest economy has been largely favorable. \"When somebody is asked 'what do you think about the economy,'' they are not answering 'what do you think about the economy,' Bianco said. \"They are answering 'What have you read about the economy?'\" Bianco fears the Fed will make a policy error based on respondents' answers. \"Economists like at the Fed say 'Wow, look at that data. It's even better than we thought. We have to raise rates even faster,'\" he said, adding that the tightening could derail the bull market. \"The 10-Year [yield] could very well be at 3 percent by the end of next year with a 3 percent funds rate,\" Bianco said. \"[That's when] you get an inverted yield curve.\" He suggested Fed officials should evolve and begin looking at other types of data. A solution would be favoring Google Trends, according to Bianco. His research suggests it's a far more accurate predictor of how the economy is faring. \"We bare our souls to Google,\" Bianco said. \"If we lose our job, we type in 'I lost my job.'

Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska stepped down as a director of his aluminum firm Rusal as part of a choreographed series of steps which he hopes will persuade the U.S. government to rescind sanctions that have crippled his businesses. Deripaska is now actively preparing the next step: reducing his stake in En+, the group which controls Rusal, to a level where Washington would be willing to remove his businesses from its sanctions blacklist, three sources familiar with the discussions said. Deripaska and the biggest companies in his empire were included on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions blacklist in April. Washington said he and fellow tycoons were profiting from association with a Kremlin conducting \"malign activities\" around the globe. show chapters The Trump-Russia ties hiding in plain sight 1:33 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 07:56 The sanctions paralyzed Rusal's supply chain, scared off many customers, froze Deripaska out of Western debt markets and sent shares in his major companies plummeting. In an illustration of the damage dealt by the sanctions, Russia's VTB bank said it had become owner of a 9.6 percent stake in En+ after the firm's stocks sank. The price slump triggered a margin call, forcing a minority shareholder, Singapore's AnAn Group, to relinquish the stake to the lender, a VTB executive said. In a statement issued in Hong Kong, where it is listed, Rusal said Deripaska, a non-executive director of the company, had stepped down as director. That came a day after the chief executive and seven board members quit, also in a move to distance the firm from Deripaska and his associates. Deripaska is seeking to persuade Washington to ease the sanctions on his businesses in exchange for him scaling back his association with his companies. The key element now is for him to reduce his controlling stake. One source familiar with the discussions said Deripaska had been intent on holding on to control, but has now accepted there is no alternative if his businesses are to survive. The maneuver under consideration, according to three sources familiar with the discussions, would mirror steps taken by another sanctioned Russian tycoon, Viktor Vekselberg. His Swiss-based company Sulzer bought some of Vekselberg's shares, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to say that Sulzer was not at risk from sanctions. Deripaska currently holds a 66 percent stake in En+. The group declined immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. show chapters We are not lending new money to Oleg Deripaska: VTB's Kostin 2:02 AM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 02:52 The three sources, who asked not to be named, said that the share buyback maneuver was one of several options under consideration for reducing Deripaska's stake. Talking to Washington The sources said Deripaska's representatives were in discussions with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which oversees sanctions, to establish if the maneuver would be deemed enough to remove the companies from the sanctions blacklist. \"It's one of the options being discussed now with OFAC,\" said one of the sources. A U.S. Treasury official, asked about any discussions with Deripaska's representatives on him reducing his stake, said OFAC does not generally comment on ongoing discussions about sanctions relief. \"OFAC reviews each request based on the facts and circumstances of the case and individual merits,\" the official said. Underlining the depth of the difficulties facing Deripaska's firms, a Russian government source said that Rusal had asked the Russian government to buy some of its output. Since sanctions hit, stocks of aluminum ingots have been stacking up at at least one Rusal plant, because buyers have canceled orders. The government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deripaska had also applied for loans for Rusal from Russian lender Promsvyazbank. The bank is under the control of the Russian central bank and has been earmarked by the Kremlin to provide finance to sanctioned Russian firms, a task most regular banks will not undertake because of the sanctions risk. Deripaska also sought state support for automaker GAZ, which is part of his business empire and has also been affected by the sanctions, the government source said. Russian authorities have approved a loan for GAZ, but no decision has yet been made on the loan request for Rusal, according to the source. Rusal did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on requests for state help.

While it wasn't a full repeal as some had hoped, it's the first legislative overhaul since the Dodd-Frank Act became law in 2010. This debate has primarily been framed as a fight over regulation. Democrats generally want more to protect taxpayers and investors from the next crisis; Republicans want less because they argue it stifles economic growth. More from The Conversation: The US economy is in desperate need of a strong dose of fiscal penicillin How money is destroying the world Recent stock market sell-off foreshadows a new Great Recession So who's right? Based on our combined 35 years of experience with securities markets and the research we've done for our book, \"When the Levees Break: Re-visioning Regulation of the Securities Markets,\" we think both sides are wrong. The issue isn't about more or less regulation but about the need for a streamlined system that supports 21st-century investing. If we had our way, the whole system of financial regulation would be burned to the ground and replaced with something entirely different. Of bonds and banks When we think of financial markets, we tend to jumble securities markets like stocks, bonds and commodities with conventional bank lending such as checking accounts and lines of credit. Dodd-Frank, for example, was ostensibly focused on regulation of securities markets, but the rules that got the most attention were those that affect the \"too big to fail\" banks. That those banks straddled both worlds \u2013 securities trading and traditional banking \u2013 is what made the 2008 financial crisis life-threatening. But only securities trading, and in particular derivatives, was at the root of the crisis. So for our purposes, when we talk about financial regulation, our focus is on the securities markets. How did we get here? The financial markets meltdown in the fall of 2008 devastated the U.S. economy, but it wasn't nearly as bad as the stock market rout that preceded the Great Depression in October 1929. After the 1929 crash, lawmakers reacted by passing laws aimed at ensuring investor protection. Two groundbreaking pieces of legislation, passed in 1933 and 1934, required companies to submit quarterly and annual reports and established the Securities and Exchange Commission. These laws form the cornerstone of modern securities markets regulation. But they were only the beginning. As markets expanded and changed, Congress continued to craft new laws that added more agencies to oversee Wall Street activities. As a result, we have more than two dozen agencies, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges \u2013 such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Justice Department \u2013 not to mention state securities agencies, all with overlapping regulatory jurisdictions. Moreover, the laws have been reactionary \u2013 rather than visionary \u2013 resulting in competing concerns and duplicative audit and enforcement procedures. Not surprisingly, there is largely no coordination or communication between them. Meanwhile, the SEC \u2013 as primary regulator \u2013 is bogged down with too many directives, many of which are under- or unfunded. For decades, whenever Congress passed a bill to \"regulate\" big changes in the markets \u2013 from market crashes to \"advancements\" such as mutual funds and investment advisers \u2013 the SEC has been required to add oversight of these new practices to their existing responsibilities. Dodd-Frank, for example, expanded the SEC's role and called for additional internal audits of existing practices but \u2013 like past market-related legislation \u2013 failed to include funding for those activities. Amid all the regulation, investor protection seems to have gotten lost. Enter Dodd-Frank The severity of the 2008 crash and its economic impact \u2013 including investment company failures and unprecedented government bailouts \u2013 goaded Congress into action. In 2010 Democratic lawmakers passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the most extensive revision of securities regulation since the 1930s, with the hope that more regulation would prevent another crisis. Republicans have argued for its repeal ever since, claiming the law and the regulations designed to implement it \u2013 some of which have yet to be implemented \u2013 inhibit prosperity. Both parties are missing the point. The current system of financial regulation is built on how stocks were traded in the 1930s \u2013 when computers and algorithmic trading had yet to be a glimmer in a quant's eye. To paraphrase an Oldsmobile commercial, it's not your father's stock market anymore. My, how markets have changed Financial markets have undergone a fundamental transformation over the past 80 years. First of all, there are the investors themselves. The mom and pop investor who the SEC was created to protect has by and large been replaced by institutional investors, including quantitative analysts, or \"quants,\" that use complex algorithmic formulas to predict the best trading strategies. In fact, algorithmic trading makes up the majority of volume in today's markets. Then there's the issue of disclosure. Since the dawn of federal securities regulation, lawmakers and regulators have relied on disclosure to protect investors. Public companies are required to disclose volumes of information, from financial information to dealings with Iran and even their code of ethics. As a result, a company can spend over a million dollars each year complying with disclosure regulations that few people actually read. Yet every time there's a new disaster, Congress piles on the disclosure requirements, as happened with Dodd-Frank. But for all the hundreds of pages of disclosure, at no time in the past 80 years has there been a mandate to review the actual securities products issued by public companies and investment banks. There are no \"safety\" standards for stocks, like there are for cars or toasters. The products that brought down the house in 2008 \u2013 mortgage-backed securities and products derived from them \u2013 continue to be offered to the public, including new ones backed by credit card debt and student loans. Finally, the SEC and other regulators are unequipped to keep up with the breathtaking changes in technology, let alone anticipate potential advances and challenges. To understand why, one must only consider the breadth of organizations that have fallen victim to hackers, from Target and Yahoo to the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Reserve itself. Unfortunately, however, Congress does not fund the SEC in a way that would allow it to pay for the skills or systems it needs to keep up with technological and other market advances. Following Dodd-Frank, for example, the SEC's budget was actually reduced, even as its responsibilities multiplied. In sum, what we have is a regulatory system that fails in its mission to protect investors. The structure used to oversee current investment practices, corporate disclosures, product development and technological advances is based on the market failures of 1929. It's a bit like trying to surf the internet using a typewriter. Preparing for the next crash The next \"big\" crash will likely be bigger than the last one. So how do we prepare for it? What we've done so far won't protect us in the future. Dodd-Frank is largely an extension of the existing patchwork structure. While the new legislation won't make things worse \u2013 as it's targeting small and mid-sized banks \u2013 Republican hopes to repeal the rest of it and return banks to the pre-crisis period of self-regulation would. After the next crash, institutions will not be too big to fail, they'll be too big to save. The answer, in our view, is to move away from a fight about how much regulation toward a complete rethinking of how we regulate investing. Only then will the U.S. begin to prepare for the next big one.

Neu-Ner said that with a smaller market size and fewer people in an unregulated and often misunderstood industry, it was easier to take advantage of what was unknown. Now though, he said, regulations are a good thing, as manipulation would be harder with \"eyes everywhere.\" \"Everyone is worried about who's watching,\" he said. Kelly agreed, pointing out that clear regulatory guidelines and a manipulation-free market were some of the SEC's guidelines for a physically backed exchange-traded fund. \"This is one more step toward the maturation of this process,\" Kelly said. Neu-Ner has previously warned investors and regulators alike about the need to establish regulations on ICOs. Without them, he said, the U.S. could risk \"falling behind\" other countries in terms of innovation and hosting companies that use blockchain technology.

The report, citing sources, said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was assisting in the investigation. However, bitcoin soon recovered its losses for the day and was trading near $7,570 in the afternoon, down just 8 percent since Friday. The CFTC, which oversees bitcoin futures, declined to comment, as did the Justice Department. \"I have not seen any evidence of price manipulation in bitcoin markets, but am certainly in favor of increased oversight, as it can only help to instill further confidence in the crypto markets,\" said Joe DiPasquale, founder and CEO of BitBull Capital, a cryptofund that invests in other cryptofunds. show chapters Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin 8:40 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 07:38 Other negative news could have hit bitcoin's price harder this week, but did not. On Monday, the North American Securities Administrators Association announced that an \"Operation Cryptosweep\" crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud has resulted in nearly 70 inquiries and investigations nationwide since the beginning of this month. Thirty-five enforcement actions are pending or completed. \"These actions signal that 'adult supervision' is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for the crypto-currency investor,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a Thursday report. Lee maintained his midyear price target of $20,000 on bitcoin and a year-end forecast of $25,000. That said, it may take longer for the cryptocurrency market to recover from the regulatory uncertainty that has contributed to bitcoin's more than 50 percent plunge at the start of this year. Lee had predicted bitcoin would get a boost last week from Consensus and other cryptocurrency conferences during New York City's \"Blockchain Week.\" But the regulatory overhang persisted. On the Friday heading into the week of conferences, bitcoin fell to its lowest since April 20, a three-week low, after news prosecutors raided the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. \"The crypto market is still in its infancy \u2014 we are in the stone ages comparatively \u2014 and very sensitive to news and manipulation,\" said Matthew Roszak, co-founder of blockchain company Bloq and chairman of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. \"As the market matures with better infrastructure (exchanges, futures, etc.) along with increased participation from global institutional investors,\" he said, \"the market will get past these growing pains.\" WATCH: DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe show chapters DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe 8:39 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 03:41 ", "author": "Chesnot | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/bitcoin-tracking-for-slight-weekly-losses-despite-regulatory-crackdown.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Chesnot | Getty Images Bitcoin", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "WILDLY", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\" Brian Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BKCM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "DoJ", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CFTC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin ETF", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "six-week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "7,272", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "morning", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the U.S. Department of Justice", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "7,570", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the afternoon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "just 8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CFTC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Justice Department", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Joe DiPasquale", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "BitBull Capital", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8:40 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "24", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "07:38 Other negative news", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the North American Securities Administrators Association", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "nearly 70", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the beginning of this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Thirty-five", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Fundstrat", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Tom Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "midyear", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "year-end", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "25,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "more than 50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the start of this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Consensus", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "New York City's", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Blockchain Week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "April 20", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three-week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "South Korea", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Matthew Roszak", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Chamber of Digital Commerce", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "DOJ", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8:39 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "24", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Bitcoin has held up relatively well this week despite negative headlines about regulatory crackdowns.", "title": "Bitcoin tracking for slight weekly losses despite news of regulatory crackdowns", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/18/105217570-blockchain.jpg?v=1533336284"}, {"time": "2018-05-30T10:15:39-0400", "body": " show chapters 2017's highest-earning hedge fund managers 8:19 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 05:22 Four hedge fund managers joined the 10-figure club last year, making more than $1 billion as the industry showed signs of a rebound. Indeed, the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers last year made the most money they have in four years, collectively $15.38 billion, according to Institutional Investor, which has ranked managers by annual earnings for the last 17 years. That works out to an average of $615 million per manager, an increase of 40 percent from the previous year. It took $225 million just to make it into the most recent ranking, up from $130 million in 2016 and $135 million in 2015. The average hedge fund is doing better, and managers are generating bigger returns than 2016, when about half of them lost money or only made it into the single digits as far as investment gains, Institutional Investor said. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index was up 8.59 percent last year, versus 5.44 percent the year before. So far this year, the index is up 0.39 percent. The Institutional Investor ranking includes gains on managers' own capital invested in their fund and their share of the firms' total fees. Making it onto the list largely depends on gains on their own capital. James Simons of Renaissance Technologies topped the list at $1.7 billion. Next were Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, at $1.5 billion, Citadel's Kenneth Griffin at $1.4 billion and Bridgewater Associates' Raymond Dalio at $1.3 billion. Renaissance's funds beat their historical average, with double-digit gains, while the next three managers fell short of their own averages, but they have so much of their own wealth tied up in their funds that they were able to reap gains from their own capital, Institutional Investor noted. Tepper more than doubled his personal earnings last year even though Appaloosa's 13 percent gain lagged the S&P 500 and the fund's 30 percent historical annualized gain. The manager, who vaulted to second place from fifth the year before, had big bets last year on Micron Technology, Facebook and Alphabet, as well as the debt and equity of Caesars Entertainment that contributed to the gains. Tepper recently won the bidding for the NFL's Carolina Panthers, agreeing to pay $2.2 billion. Griffin also more than doubled his earnings last year. Dalio earned slightly less than he did the prior year and slipped from second to fourth in the ranking, but Institutional Investor points out that management fees helped keep him in the top five. Bridgewater's Pure Alpha I and II funds were each up about 1.2 percent compared with the strategy's annualized 11.9 percent gain since 1991. That means Dalio didn't generate his money based on returns or performance fees. Instead, at $108 billion, the world's largest hedge fund firm is able to generate a huge pot of management fees, Institutional Investor said. Third Point's Dan Loeb moved up to seventh from 12th place, making $625 million last year on his best returns since 2013. Making a debut on the list at No. 20 is Scott Shleifer, a partner at Tiger Global Management and head of its public equity business. Tiger's long-short funds rose 28.2 percent last year, and its long-only funds were up 38.1 percent. That meant a paycheck of $260 million for Shleifer.

It's becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.\" Stutland said that makes sense considering cryptocurrency is still an unregulated way for investors to transfer capital. \"Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets,\" he said. \"Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.\" And investors are more likely to be cautious with their money when banks have increased credit risks, Stutland said. \"As credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market,\" he said. The VIX shot up to highs of 18.39 Tuesday, from Friday's lows of 12.59. The market also had a turbulent day Tuesday. All three major indexes closed lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 500 points at its lows. Bitcoin, priced around $7,500 6:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, down from nearly $9,000 a month ago or close to $10,000 on May 5.

It has recently expanded its Singapore and Tokyo offices, too. This year, Point72 raised $3 billion from outside investors. The firm had been barred from accepting outside money in the wake of a settlement Cohen made in 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He's also interested in China's financial services. \"In the past, financial services was probably was essentially banks and some insurance businesses, but today it's much more diversified as you see the growth in asset management or payments lending more generally,\" he added. While Point72 is not actually in China at the moment, Desmidt said Hong Kong is in an increasingly important position to take advantage of into the region's opportunities. Point72 declined to comment on whether it's raising raising capital in Asia. Despite, the SEC ban ending earlier this year, it has not been an entirely smooth period for the firm.

The digital currency's increased number of use cases is proof that the popular form of money is being institutionalized. \"Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,\" Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Friday. \"Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk,\" he added. \"A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive,\" he said. Still, the coin has seen better days. After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again \u2014 this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400. Regardless, Bogart said it's still a buy. In fact, he said it's the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream. Many of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\" Bogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO. \"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart said. \"They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\" Alternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as \"neutral\" \u2014 and he told investors to hold for now. Bogart said he's especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don't work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on. Bitcoin, however, should \"at least\" end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind. \"But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,\" he said of bitcoin increasing value. \"Could bitcoin trade lower?

According to Blackstone's Joseph Zidle, there's evidence that rising inflation will tear into corporate profits and stretch consumers within the next 12 months. \"As we get into 2019, this earnings cycle is going to run its course. The earnings growth will have to slow because the year-over-year comps get so tough,\" he told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" on Thursday. \"When you've got slower earnings growth and higher interest rates, that's going to knock down equity valuations.\" It's a scenario that's already unfolding. \"It's not strong, but it's broad-based. We're seeing it in things like higher oil prices and higher gas prices where oil is up 50 percent year over year. Gas is up 20 percent year over year. We're seeing it all throughout wages,\" he said. Despite his cautious outlook for next year, Zidle believes it's way too premature for investors to head into the bear camp \u2014 saying that the \"tug-of-war\" between macro headwinds such as North Korea tensions and fundamentals will end favorably for stocks by summer. \"When you're lifting up the hood on the earnings story, it really tells you they're quite healthy. So, I think the fundamentals are going to ultimately win out here,\" said Zidle. \"I'm optimistic. I think the second half is actually going to be a very good environment for equities.\" He has a 3,000 year-end forecast on the S&P 500, about a 10 percent increase from current levels. According to Zidle, energy, materials, industrials and emerging markets will lead the markets back into record territory. But Zidle pointed out that many investors are sabotaging themselves right now by abandoning overweight positions in stocks in favor of fixed income, an area of the markets often seemed safer when there's fear of an economic slowdown. \"Investors are overweight fixed income, and they're intermediate to long-term durations. So, they're not positioned for that rise in rates,\" Zidle said. \"They are taking duration risk at a time when they ought to be very short duration and taking credit risk.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

He added that the stock should be able to appreciate 2.5 to threefold over the next five to six years.

Bullard, who has previously flagged the need for a caution in raising rates, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar in Tokyo on Tuesday the Fed had enough tools and policy options to respond if the U.S. economy falls into a recession. He said in a speech earlier in the day that U.S. interest rates may have already hit the \"neutral\" level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. \"It is hard for U.S. rates to get too far out of line with the global rate situation, and obviously both the (Bank of Japan) and the (European Central Bank) are continuing very accommodative policies,\" Bullard told reporters. \"Is it constraining? It is in the sense that there is a global equilibrium of rates and if you get too far out of line things have to happen, exchange rates have to move, and other things have to happen.\" Bullard said he did not want to prejudge the Fed's next meeting in June, but he reiterated his view that the Fed does not need to raise interest rates further because inflation expectations are low. The Fed held interest rates steady in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent on May 2. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates in June, and continue a gradual series of increases until perhaps the middle of next year. In prepared remarks, Bullard repeated his views that inflation expectations remain a bit below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, and that interest rates worldwide are being held down by longer-term economic and demographic trends. There are \"a few reasons for caution\" in further rate increases, said Bullard, who has argued before that the Fed should halt its rate raising cycle until it is clear that economic growth and inflation have moved into a higher gear. If the current policy rate is at neutral, \"it may not be necessary to change the policy rate\" in order to keep the economy close to or at the Fed's goal, Bullard said. Holding off on further rate increases, he said, would help improve market-based measures of inflation expectations and make the Fed's commitment to meeting its inflation target more credible. It would also lower risks that short-term interest rates might rise above long-term ones, an \"inversion\" of the yield curve that has often preceded a recession. When asked whether the BOJ should change its 2 percent inflation target, Bullard said he saw no need for a change because 2 percent inflation has become a global standard for price targeting. He added that a central bank that changed its inflation target from 2 percent effectively commits itself to a significant change in its currency level, due to the consequent shift in interest rate expectations.

Ant Financial Services Group, operator of China's biggest online payment platform by market share, Alipay, has closed its latest funding round having raised $10 billion from a clutch of global and local investors, five people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Ant's first fundraising targeting global money values the firm at $150 billion, the people said, compared with about $60 billion after its previous fundraising in April 2016. A number of global sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms joined the fundraising as main investors. They include Singapore's sovereign fund GIC Pte Ltd and state investor Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd, as well as U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL], the people said. show chapters Ant Financial nears $10 billion equity raise, sources tell CNBC 7:16 AM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 | 01:45 Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd has also joined as a major investor, one of the people said. The funding round also brought in private equity firm Carlyle Group LP and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which typically invests in early-stage start-ups, three of the people said. The amount and investor line-up are finalized and the transfer of funds is underway, the people said. The funding round includes a separate tranche of around 7 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in new shares which has not been finalized, two of the people said. The people spoke to Reuters on condition they not be identified as the deal details are not yet public. Ant, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma, declined to comment. Carlyle, Temasek and Warburg declined to comment. Khanazah, GIC and Sequoia Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The capital-raising comes ahead of a widely expected initial public offering (IPO), though Ant has neither publicly set a timetable nor chosen a likely stock exchange. A $150 billion valuation would make Ant's IPO one of the biggest ever - comparing to the $104 billion of Facebook Inc six years ago and Alibaba's $168 billion in 2014. A fundraising document seen by Reuters showed Ant planned to list both in China and Hong Kong in 2019, and its investors joining the latest fundraising could expect to exit within one to three years. Ant declined to comment on the document. Strong demand from investors looking to position themselves ahead of Ant's potential IPO has resulted in a much higher amount than an initial target of up to $5 billion, which Reuters earlier reported. Four-year-old Ant, which was spun off from Alibaba when the group went public in New York, has diversified over the years into credit services, asset management and online banking, besides owning the Alipay payment platform. After becoming a dominant in payments in China, the company has also invested in a number of internet-based startups including Chinese bike-sharing company Ofo, food delivery app operator Ele.me and Indian payment company PayTM. The firm counts China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, state lender China Construction Bank Corp, the country's National Social Security Fund and big state insurers, among others, as investors from previous funding rounds.

U.S. regulators are set to rewrite rules reining in banks' risky trading behavior, making changes that will cut compliance costs but stopping far short of allowing firms to return to their gambling days seen before the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The Federal Reserve's long-anticipated proposal to alter the so-called Volcker Rule on Wednesday marks another step by Trump administration regulators to ease banking rules in a bid to boost lending and economic growth. Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Volcker Rule is aimed at preventing banks from making market bets while accepting taxpayer-insured deposits. It has forced many Wall Street banks to overhaul their trading operations and hive off billions of dollars worth of hedge funds and private equity funds. show chapters Powell: 'Sensible' for community banks to be exempt from Volcker rule 8:20 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 03:33 Banks have long complained that the rule, which took four years to write and runs at more than 1,000 pages, is vague and complex, creating a disproportionate compliance burden and limiting their ability to facilitate investments and hedges for investors. \"This revision is likely to make only modest changes to the rule that would benefit banks at the margin. It will not mark the wholesale return of bank proprietary trading. The fundamental framework remains,\" said Isaac Boltanksy, director of policy research at Compass Point Trading & Research in Washington. Still, Wednesday's proposal should provide clarity over how banks can show trades qualify for certain safe harbors, especially when facilitating client trades, according to people familiar with the matter. Reuters had reported the expected changes in February. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was once quoted as saying traders would need a lawyer and a psychiatrist by their side in order to prove their trading intentions complied with the rule. The proposed changes will also likely tailor compliance requirements to an institution's size and alter aspects of the rule so it no longer encroaches upon some overseas firms, the people said. JPMorgan is looking forward to more clarity on its requirements and to spending less to prove compliance, Daniel Pinto, chief executive for the bank's corporate and investment banking business, said at an investor conference on Tuesday. But the Volcker Rule proposal \"is not going to change too much what we do and how we do it,\" Pinto said. Banks of all sizes, as well as private-equity funds and investor groups, have lobbied hard for the rule to be simplified, according to public records and sources. U.S. Congress wrote the broad strokes of the Volcker Rule into law, but five regulators oversee the rule and wrote its finer details. Industry attempts to persuade Congress to overhaul the Volcker Rule so far have failed, but regulators agree after three years of trying to enforce it that revisions are necessary to help all parties. They have been working on tweaks ever since the rule became effective in 2015, but efforts behind the scenes to draft a new rule accelerated over the past two months, the sources said. The Fed has been leading the efforts and other regulators are expected to propose the same changes in the coming days. Some bank lobbyists hope for another opportunity to push for a more radical overhaul. But such changes could take years, analysts said. \"The only way that the Volcker Rule can be fundamentally altered is if Congress chooses to do so, and that clearly isn't happening this year or anytime in the near future,\" said Boltansky.

The Tallinn, Estonia-based start-up secured a $1 billion valuation after the investment, helping it enter the ranks of Europe's unicorn companies. Korelya Capital, a French venture capital fund, Taavet Hinrikus, the co-founder of U.K.-based money transfer start-up TransferWise, and existing investor Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing firm, all participated in the round. Daimler, which owns Uber competitor MyTaxi, will join Taxify's board following the investment. \"Taxify is an ideal addition to our existing and extensive mobility services portfolio,\" Joerg Lamparter, head of mobility services at Daimler Financial Services, said in a statement Wednesday. Taxify currently has 10 million customers signed up to its platform and is present in 25 countries. The company entered London, a key battleground for Uber, last year. Taxify said it would use the latest investment to develop its technology and further expand in home markets like Europe and Africa. The investment comes as Uber, the world's best known ride-hailing start-up, tries to reshape its public image under new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. Under former boss Travis Kalanick, Uber was hit with a series of scandals, from sexual harassment complaints against the company, to allegations that it tried to evade regulation in various cities. In London, the company is fighting to keep its license to operate after a ban by the city's transport regulator last year. Also in 2017, a British judge ruled that Uber drivers should be classified as formal workers rather than as self-employed, presenting a challenge for both Uber and the so-called \"gig economy.\" Uber has long maintained that its drivers are self-employed rather than employees, and are therefore not entitled to rights including holiday pay and a minimum wage.

Shares of Disney fell Tuesday after its latest \"Star Wars\" movie failed to bring the crowds and revenue analysts had expected for Memorial Day weekend. The stock fell about 2.4 percent and is now down 8 percent for 2018. The Disney-produced \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" delivered a franchise-low $83.3 million in North American ticket sales over the three-day weekend. Over four days, the movie brought in $101 million. This was about $40 million light of revenue expectations, according to B. Riley FBR analyst Barton Crockett. \"All else equal, this suggests the Star Wars movie is pacing close to breakeven, a 2% headwind for our Disney estimates,\" Crockett said in a note to clients Tuesday. Last week, revenue forecasts had been as high as $150 million for the four-day debut of \"Solo.\" The movie marked the lowest opening for a Disney-produced film in the Star Wars franchise. Until then, \"Rogue One\" had been Disney's lowest-grossing Star Wars film, bringing in $155 million in its 2016 debut. \"The Last Jedi\" brought in $220 million, while \"The Force Awakens\" brought in $248 million, according to Box Office Mojo. The company paid $4 billion in 2012 to buy the franchise from Star Wars creator LucasFilm. The recent box office weakness could be mitigated by an advertising lift from the upcoming seven-game NBA conference finals and strength in Disney's Marvel movies franchise, FBR's Crockett said.

About 110,000 students applied for Deutsche Bank's graduate scheme this year in the most striking example of millennials' appetite for careers at even the most troubled banks. The applications for Deutsche, which recently announced 7,000 job cuts to drop its workforce to less than 90,000, were up 20 per cent in a year when rivals including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup also saw significant increases in applications, data gathered by the Financial Times shows. Several other large investment banks would not reveal application numbers but said they had increased graduate hires. UBS said it increased its UK hires by almost 50 per cent, to 100, despite the uncertain climate created by Brexit. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. Graduate hiring has been a vexed topic since the financial crisis, with banking steadily falling in popularity among the Ivy League and Oxbridge pools from which banks traditionally filled their benches. Brexit was expected to blunt London hiring. \"We had all of the top universities pre-crisis \u2026 now [our demand] is more varied. We're going broader in terms of the places where we source from,\" said Manolo Falco, Citi's head of Emea corporate and investment banking. Citi drew 60,761 applications for its corporate and investment banking programmes globally, up 12 per cent year on year. The candidates were vying for 520 jobs, which was down from the 575 offered a year earlier. Figures for Citi's markets division are not available. Deutsche's candidates were applying for jobs across the bank, according to a person with knowledge of the bank's hiring. The person said that Deutsche had hired 619 graduates globally last year, and that \"we expect that to increase this year too\". Deutsche has spent much of the last year mired in crisis, culminating in the chaotic replacement of its chief executive in April and the announcement of another round of cuts that will largely fall on the investment bank, a popular destination for graduates. Its investment bank has been one of the most progressive in its graduate hiring techniques, using groundbreaking AI assessment tools to screen a broad pool of talent for those who are the best emotional and cognitive fit for the bank. Morgan Stanley attracted about 100,000 applications for about 1,000 places on its summer analyst programme for undergraduates and its summer associates programme for MBA students. The bank said applications were up 8 per cent year on year. Barclays International will hire about 500 graduates this year, up from 450 in 2017. \"We continue to see high levels of interest in our programmes globally, including from students early in their university careers,\" said Margaret Capote, head of Barclays' International Graduate Resourcing and Development, adding that the bank had expanded its spring programmes in both the UK and the US. UBS would not give details of its application levels but said it had hired about 400 graduates so far this year, including about 100 in the UK. Last year, UBS hired about 400 graduates globally, of which 70 were in the UK. Citi's Mr. Falco said that banks' efforts to promote work-life balance had \"definitely had an impact\" on application levels, but the jobs were still very demanding. \"You can't hide it; banking is a hard-working kind of industry \u2026 Even with all of what we've done, it's high intensity over long hours.\" Banks have rolled out measures including mandatory weekends off and flexible working arrangements to make life as a junior banker less gruelling and more attractive to talented graduates weighing offers from other sectors. Citi looked at whether the intensity and hours could be reduced by simply hiring more graduates but concluded that it would not work, Falco said. \"When a client has a problem, the solution has to be the next morning, having more people wouldn't obviously fix that, the client wants specific [directors or managing directors] and those people want people around them they can trust.\" More from the Financial Times: Britain's foreign policy lacks vision for its post-Brexit future The world's progress brings new challenges Oil lower again as market mulls supply pressure ", "author": "Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/graduate-applications-flood-deutsche-and-other-banks.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Krisztian Bocsi", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Deutsche Bank AG", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Frankfurt", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Germany", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "About 110,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Deutsche Bank's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Deutsche", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "7,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "less than 90,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "20 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "a year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Morgan Stanley", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Citigroup", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "UBS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "UK", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "almost 50 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "100", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Brexit", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "4 weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just $1", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Oxbridge", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "London", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Manolo Falco", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Citi", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "60,761", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "520", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "575", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "a year earlier", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Citi", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Deutsche", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Deutsche", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "619", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Deutsche", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "AI", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Morgan Stanley", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 100,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "about 1,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "8 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Barclays International", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 500", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "450", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Margaret Capote", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Barclays' International Graduate Resourcing and Development", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "spring", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "UK", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "UBS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 400", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "about 100", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "UK", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "UBS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 400", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "70", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "UK", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Citi", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Falco", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "long hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Falco", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the next morning", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Britain", "category": "GPE"}], "description": "Even after banking climate post-Brexit has left some concerned; Deutsche bank, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup has seen significant increase in graduate applications for temporary work, the Financial Times reports.

The bank is expected to raise rates in June, beginning a gradual series of increases that could span into the middle of next year. But some say the U.S. Federal Reserve won't be able to raise interest rates faster than its European and Japanese counterparts. \"It is hard for U.S. rates to get too far out of line with the global rate situation, and obviously both the [Bank of Japan] and the [European Central Bank] are continuing very accommodative policies,\" James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, said on Tuesday.

Pity the Wall Street analyst. The ranks of investment-bank research analysts have been shrinking for years amid new regulations and subdued trading markets. Now European rules that unbundle research and trade execution has resulted in clients spending about 25 percent less on reports compared with a year earlier, according to Daniel Pinto, JP Morgan Chase co-president. Asset managers and hedge funds are likely to continue penny pinching when it comes to research, Pinto said Tuesday at a conference in New York. Previously, clients paid for research by funneling trade commissions to banks. That changed when European regulators rolled out the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, in January, forcing clients to pay for research and trades separately. \"Now that everyone is seeing what they are consuming, what they aren't, and the value of it, there will probably be another shrinkage of consumption'' beyond the 25 percent that has already happened, Pinto, 55, said Tuesday in a conference in New York. ``I think there will be one more leg down.'' Speaking about the industry, he added: \"The millions of pages we write about many things, it may not be what clients are willing to pay for.\" There is a silver lining at investment banks, but it's for traders, not research analysts who write reports and offer recommendations on stocks. While firms make less money from research, the biggest banks with the latest technology will get a larger share of trade orders, Pinto said. \"There is some evidence of that happening already,\" he said. \"Great analysts will always be valuable,\" Pinto said, adding that he hasn't reduced head count in his research department yet because he wants to see several more quarters of client behavior before making cuts. An unexpected change resulting from the rules is that clients are more likely to attend \u2014 and pay for \u2014 in-person events such as conferences, where it's possible to get analysts' views in person rather than paying for the research. Clients are heading to \"environments where they can see a lot of it at one time, so the conferences are being better attended than they were before,\" Pinto said.

The stock drop is the deepest in almost two years and made Morgan Stanley the worst-performing of the big U.S. banks on an already down day for stocks. The KBW Bank index fell 3.9 percent amid concerns around European countries, including Italy and Spain. The firm is seeing \"obvious headwinds\" in transaction revenue among retail clients as activity slowed in March and remained slower through April and May, Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, said Tuesday in a New York conference. Saperstein also cited relatively low pricing on fee-based accounts. Those accounts are pegged to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter, when the market was swooning. Morgan Stanley will spend more on interest expense than before as it diversifies its deposit sources, slowing the growth of net interest income, Saperstein said.

It would be a great pity if the occasion were missed because \u2014 as some foreign leaders argue \u2014 Trump was too absorbed by watershed Congressional elections in early November. There is no doubt that the president realizes how much the world affairs are inextricably part of key events that will determine the fate of his time in office next fall. Wall Street is reminding him of that every day with asset price changes in the wake of tax cuts, jobs and income gains and hopes of stopping America's decades-old losses of material wealth and cutting-edge intellectual property to unfair and predatory foreign trade practices. It is urgent to begin showing some progress on those issues. Not by one-liner tweets, but with a clearly stated call for action on America's vitally important national interests. That should be a comfortable exercise. America's trade case is solid. In the opposite corner are people posing as defenders of multilateralism and free trade who are, in fact, responsible for excessive trade surpluses at the expense of the U.S. and the rest of the world. Here is a thought on how that could go. The combined surplus of China and Germany on current transactions with the rest of the world came in last year at $463.4 billion. During the same period, the U.S. trade deficit on the equivalent external account was $466.2 billion. If those three countries \u2014 representing nearly 40 percent of global demand and output \u2014 were taken as a proxy for the world economy, you would have a perfect textbook case to show that the balance of payments of the world is zero, exactly as it should be, with minor measurement errors. What that also shows is that the Chinese and German trade surpluses would be enough to finance American deficits through purchases of U.S. government debt instruments. In other words, the Chinese and the Germans would be adding to their net foreign assets by recycling the dollars America paid them for their goods and services. America, of course, is left holding the bag: It is accumulating net foreign debt. At the end of last year, that debt was recently estimated to have stood at $7.8 trillion. Big deal? Of course it is, on several counts. First, large and systematic trade deficits indicate an economic policy that excessively relies on external demand to generate income and employment. These are export-driven growth strategies also known under a less flattering name of \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policies, because the countries pursuing such objectives live off their trade partners. Second, those countries are in violation of the long-established rules of trade adjustment. They are also flouting constant G-20 recommendations to balance trade accounts for a stable world economy. Third, these two major surplus countries are doing nothing in response to U.S. trade complaints over the last year-and-a-half. In the first quarter of this year, the combined trade surpluses of China and the Germany-led European Union accounted for 62.4 percent of America's total trade gap. That is almost identical to 65 percent for last year as a whole. With all that, the trade miscreants, and their apologists, continue to vilify the U.S. as a protectionist destroying the rules-based multinational trading system \u2014 simply because Washington sought relief from soaring debts and deficits, with losses of jobs, incomes and intellectual property. And that outrageous perversion continues. As recently as last Friday, the International Monetary Fund, the U.N.'s key economic and financial agency, warned at an international business meeting in Russia about \"the darkest cloud\" over the world economy caused by the \"determination of some (read: the U.S.) to actually rock the system that has actually presided over the trade relationships that we have all undertaken and enjoyed to some extent over the last many decades.\" Enjoyed, indeed \u2014 at America's expense. That's what Trump is told by a U.N. agency whose original charter calls for a symmetrical obligation of deficit and surplus countries to balance their trade accounts in order to make possible a system of stable exchange rates in a steadily growing world economy. Essentially, that is still the IMF's mission. Washington should take a note of that, and stop whining that balancing America's trade accounts will be very difficult. That defeatist stand sounds like the countries that, in Trump's vernacular, are \"ripping us off\" should be doing the country a favor by buying more American goods and services. This is no time for a trade discourse via tweets and occasional off-the-cuff broadsides. The G-7 meeting next week is a stage to demand a rapid reduction of America's excessive trade deficits. Trump should also know that his trade opponents are regrouping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel completed last week her 11th visit to Beijing, where, apparently, she secured substantial alternatives to German export sales on American markets. German media are reporting that she even explored a free-trade agreement with China \u2014 a total reversal of recent threats and accusations she leveled at Beijing's discriminatory trade and investment practices, and the Chinese meddling in Germany's Central and East European backyards. That's called realpolitik, and it came with kudos from German media for showing Trump how things are done. Investment thoughts With the Federal Reserve poised for interest rate increases in response to rising inflation and a strengthening economy, markets are increasingly sensitive to trade frictions and military confrontations. The U.S. should calm things down by making sure that China and the EU accept \u2014 without the usual equivocations \u2014 to fully cooperate in a rapid balancing out of trade accounts with America. Overseas tensions with proxy wars and debilitating sanctions is another source of problems depressing U.S. asset prices \u2014 in spite of a favorable market environment created by supportive fiscal policies and the Fed's measured pace of liquidity withdrawals. Unless Trump can reduce trade frictions and geopolitical confrontations in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and East Asia, he should not count on another tax cut to rev up financial markets in anticipation of next November's elections.

shares and convertible bonds, a document reviewed by Reuters shows. Ahead of the planned listing, HNA is seeking to raise about $350 million by selling new shares, expanding its equity base by 22 percent, according to the document dated April 2018. That would give the 12-year-old airline a pre-IPO valuation of about $1.6 billion, based on Reuters calculations. Greg Baker | AFP | Getty Images The company also wants to raise up to $550 million via convertible bonds or tradable bonds before the listing, the document showed. The bond issue will be at a coupon rate of 8-to-10 percent for a two-to-five year period, according to the document. For comparison, Virgin Australia Holdings, a partner of Hong Kong Airlines \u2014 which also lacks an investment grade rating \u2014 this month raised A$150 million ($113 million) through a senior unsecured bond at a coupon of 8.25 percent, according to Thomson Reuters IFR. HNA referred fund raising questions to Hong Kong Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines declined to comment. HNA Group declined to comment on its relationship with HK Airlines. These latest moves, previously unreported, signal its IPO plans for Hong Kong Airlines are back on after HNA tried to take it public a few years ago, eventually abandoning those plans in 2015. That attempt failed as it was unable to satisfy questions from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the timeline provided. It did not refile its listing application. The document reviewed by Reuters did not contain the reasons behind the new push for an offering, or the investor interest HNA may be able to generate. The Chinese aviation-to-financial services firm, which struck M&A deals worth about $50 billion in 2016 and 2017, is faced with soaring debt and a Beijing crackdown on aggressive Chinese acquirers. Tyrone Siu | Reuters A floor trader checks share prices at the Hong Kong Exchange in Hong Kong. HNA, which is selling a number of assets, is undergoing a wider reorganization under which it is partnering with companies to manage some of its assets. Reuters reported last month that HNA Group is seeking to raise as much as $1.5 billion by the end of this year in an investment fund that will serve a vehicle for the group's acquisitions. Some of HNA's other recent IPO efforts have been delayed or scrapped. HNA Group's Swiss ground services and cargo handling unit, Swissport Group, deferred plans to float shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange, citing market conditions. HNA Group scrapped its planned listing of Swiss-based airline caterer Gategroup. The new capital raising plans come at a time when Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings has expressed interest in buying into Hong Kong Airlines and its unit Hong Kong Express Airways, Reuters reported last month. The document obtained by Reuters shows that Hong Kong Airlines is targeting annual revenue of HK$14.97 billion ($1.9 billion) in 2018 and a compound annual revenue growth rate of 15 percent between 2015 and 2018. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) \u2014 a measure used by hospitality companies \u2014 are estimated to have grown 11.4 percent in 2017 to about HK$4.21 billion. Estimates for 2018's earnings were not provided in the document. Hong Kong Airlines is a carrier that operates 38 aircraft and flies to 40 cities in the Asia Pacific, Australia and North America. Its asset base is estimated to have grown 65 percent to HK$12.97 billion by 2017 from net assets of HK$7.84 billion in 2016, according to the document.

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Warren Buffett told CNBC on Wednesday that it was true his Berkshire Hathaway considered investing in the privately held ride-hailing company Uber earlier this year, but he wasn't always so enthusiastic about the sharing economy. During Berkshire's 2014 annual meeting, Buffett handled a question about whether the disruptive business model used by Airbnb and Uber was here to stay and what implications that had for their sectors. \"The ones you name, I don't know anything about,\" he said in a clip found through CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive. \"I mean, I know what they do, but I don't know their specific prospects, which is why we kind of stay away from that sort of thing because we don't \u2014 we know there'll be change, and we don't know who the winners will be. And we try to stick with businesses where we know the winners.\" But a lot has changed in four years, apparently. On Wednesday, after reports came out that Berkshire had offered a $3 billion investment in Uber, Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick that while some of the details weren't correct it was true the two had talked and the discussions fell apart over terms. But, he told CNBC, \"I'm a great admirer\" of Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. For his part, Khosrowshahi told CNBC's Carl Quintanilla in an interview at the Code conference that it's always possible talks will resume. \"We are a company that has, as you know, an enormous growth trajectory but at the same time it comes with considerable risk,\" he said. \"So I don't think we necessarily fit in with the typical Warren Buffett investment. Maybe we can be a different kind of investment, a portfolio diversification play for him.\" Buffett has a history of taking big stakes in private companies or buying them outright, such as Dairy Queen and, more recently, Pilot Flying J. But the Uber investment would have been along the lines of Berkshire's financial crisis-era investment in Goldman Sachs, backing it with his reputation at a time when Wall Street banks were reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and thirsty for capital. In deals like this, Berkshire helps a company boost capital in exchange for lucrative terms allowing it to reap significant gains. In 2008, Berkshire got $5 billion of preferred shares of Goldman with warrants to buy $5 billion of stock down the road at a low strike price. It did a similar deal with Bank of America in 2011, and is now that bank's biggest shareholder. Uber has been trying to recover after cultural issues and management turnover, as well as a fatal driverless car crash. Earlier this year, it got $1.25 billion from a group led by SoftBank, which also bought shares from existing investors and employees. Khosrowshahi told CNBC he was a Buffett \"fan boy\" and hopes to make a deal happen some day. \"One of my business goals in life has been to get Warren Buffett to invest in something that I'm involved in, and so far, I've failed. So maybe, maybe one day I can convince him.\" ", "author": "David A.

The Federal Reserve has designated Deutsche Bank's U.S. business as being in \"troubled condition,\" The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The downgrade to one of the lowest designations occurred about a year ago and has not been previously reported, the report said. The Financial Times also reported Thursday, citing a source, that Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiary was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's list of \"problem banks,\" or those with weaknesses that threaten their financial survival. U.S.-traded Deutsche Bank shares closed 4.2 percent lower, off worst levels of more than 8.5 percent lower earlier in the session. The stock is down more than 40 percent this year. \"As a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific regulatory feedback,\" a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in a statement. \"The ultimate parent of the Deutsche Bank Group, Deutsche Bank AG, is very well capitalized and has significant liquidity reserves.\" The spokesperson also said its principal U.S. banking subsidiary \"has a very robust balance sheet.\" A FDIC spokesperson said the agency does not comment on open and operating institutions. The Federal Reserve declined to comment, saying bank ratings are confidential. The supervisory ratings could be misinterpreted if released publicly, Randal Quarles, vice chairman for supervision at the Fed, said Thursday afternoon in an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman. \"I think that there's benefit when there is concrete, quantifiable information in making that information available to the public and to markets,\" Quarles said. \"The supervisory ratings are a result of a more subjective assessment of a very broad array of factors that I think there's reasonable concern could be subject to misinterpretation if those were more open.\" The Frankfurt-based bank has struggled in the last few years. It has reported three straight years of losses, and in April switched its CEO for the fourth time in six years. Last week, reports said Deutsche Bank will \"sharply\" reduce its U.S. presence as it cuts back on global equities trading. At the time, the bank declined CNBC's request for comment.

Siegel, who helped lead 2017's rally cry, told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" that he isn't blaming Italy's political turmoil, the latest headline to rock the markets, for a borderline bearish forecast. Rather, he cited risks from rising rates to trade tensions. \"The major threat of the market is higher interest rates going forward. Too many people read the FOMC minutes as being too dovish,\" he said Wednesday. Siegel expects the Federal Reserve to hike rates a total of four times this year, a number Wall Street may be dangerously underestimating. As rates rise, stocks historically look less appealing to investors. He's also viewing trade tensions with China as a \"wild card\" for the market. \"[President Donald Trump] feels he has to tread very, very carefully on this. It doesn't mean for sure he won't go full blast forward,\" Siegel said. \"Caution is going to be the word here.\" His thoughts came as stocks staged a comeback a day after Italy tensions rattled the market. The Dow grabbed 306 points to close at 24,667. But it still fell short of breaking even from Tuesday's losses. Siegel has been warning since December that 2018 wouldn't be as robust as 2017, and stocks would be flat to up 10 percent by year-end. \"This is a great year for earnings, no one argues with that. But the tax cut is front-loaded which means that the write-offs on capital equipment are going to accrue to 2018 and not nearly as much in 2019,\" Siegel said.

Elizabeth Ann Photography | Silvergate Bank Alan Lane, CEO of Silvergate bank. \"How can I contact Silvergate?\" a young, dark-haired man in a black hoodie asked frantically at last month's Consensus conference, a massive gathering in New York City for those interested in bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. It was after hours, and Silvergate's exhibit booth had closed for the day. The man, one of thousands of people who paid $2,000 for access to the conference, had seemingly broken a sweat tracking down the unassuming booth in search of the man known for bankrolling cryptocurrency start-ups: Silvergate Bank CEO Alan Lane. He noticed Lane's stray card sitting on the table, and lit up. \"This is exactly what I need.\" Google Earth Silvergate Bank in La Jolla, California. San Diego-based Silvergate is a 30-year-old community bank with three branches in southern California. Yet, it has become known as a lifeline for cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that had their accounts closed or were turned down by Wall Street banks wary of an emerging asset with potential ties to money laundering. Even Warren Buffett has expressed his skepticism about bitcoin, calling it \"rat poison.\" Undeterred, Lane is one of the most aggressive executives in cryptocurrencies. Alongside the recent surge of interest in bitcoin and its rivals, Silvergate doubled its assets to $1.9 billion last year. The bank now has more than 250 international clients in the industry, drawing new customers by acting more like a 24/7 clearinghouse for cryptocurrency exchanges. On the surface, the 56- year-old seems much more like a college professor, or a priest, than a wheeling-and-dealing bank executive. During a recent interview, Lane took off his glasses before answering a question he has clearly been asked before: Why would you bet this small bank's reputation on one of the biggest headline risks of the past five years? The grandfather of 21, and devout Catholic, said he became interested in cryptocurrency in 2013. At the time, he had been reading about bitcoin and how it might disrupt banking, an industry he had grown to love and started working in when he was a student at San Diego State University. Because of what's known as \"distributed ledger\" technology, people could theoretically become their own banks, without the need for third parties, he found out. \"I thought \"uh oh, what am I gonna do?\" Lane said with a laugh. The first thing he did was buy some. In his research, he also learned that companies trading bitcoin were being turned down left and right by other banks. \"I put two and two together and I thought, well it might disrupt banking long-term but in the short-term these companies need banks,\" he said. \"They're not doing anything wrong. They're not doing anything illegal or immoral. If they were we wouldn't be banking them.\" Embracing crypto Five years ago, when bitcoin was still at the fringes of mainstream awareness, Silvergate invited in young crypto exchanges and asked them what problems they were trying to solve and how the bank could be helpful. In order to do business with them as a state chartered bank, Silvergate needed the California State Banking Department on board as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In the summer of 2014, they brought the two regulators in and put on a presentation on bitcoin. \"That open communication with the regulators early on has proven to be really foundational,\" Lane said. \"We're very collaborative with the regulators, we ask them if they have suggestions, and what we can do better.\" Silvergate has a track record of timely reinvention. The bank was founded as a thrift in 1988. Less than a decade later, current Chairman Dennis Frank, an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, reorganized it into a bank. Frank had left Wall Street during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s to buy up failed thrifts through Houston's Coastal Banc. After selling Coastal in 2004, he moved on to California, where he would recruit investors from his Goldman days to invest in, and re-capitalize Silvergate in 1996. Under Frank's leadership, Silvergate stopped its mortgage operations in 2005 before the subprime meltdown. And when the 2008 financial crisis hit, the bank was in a solid position to lend as many other banks were paralyzed by bad mortgages on their balance sheets. That's when Frank asked Lane to come in as CEO. By then, Lane had worked his way up in the industry through several executive positions: CFO of Independence One Bank, CEO of Business Bank of California and president of Southwest Community Bancorp. Lane also had a two-year stint as a professor and co-founder John Paul the Great Catholic University in San Diego. Lane recalled Frank telling him, \"I'm a Wall Street guy and I need a banker as a partner, would you join me?\" Silvergate's ability to stay profitable during the financial crisis meant it had no shortage of lending opportunities, Lane said, but the problem was getting enough customer deposits to fund those loans. Silvergate looked to cryptocurrency companies to fill that gap. Major Silvergate clients include the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange, Paxos, bitFlyer and Kraken. David Ripley, COO of Kraken, said in an email, \"For the most part, the larger banks in the U.S. have stayed away from banking cryptocurrency businesses. In the U.S. and particularly Europe, we see smaller, more technologically advanced banks partnering with cryptocurrency businesses.\" About half of the bank's shareholders are betting that crypto is the way to go, too. They and some other investors contributed to $114 million in order to expand Silvergate's cryptocurrency businesses. Lane said the investors were drawn in as a way to invest in cryptocurrency without looking for the next new token. \"We've got institutional investors who traditionally invest in banks, and they just liked this strategy,\" Lane said. \"They're looking to get exposure in the asset class via something they understand.\" Working with cryptocurrency companies Silvergate's willingness to work with cryptocurrency companies is key to the growth of the digital asset industry overall. \"One of the ways governments had tried to make digital currency exchanges harder to operate is to cut off their banking relationships,\" said Travis Scher, Digital Currency Group's vice president of Investments. \"It hasn't always been easy for them to secure [a banking relationship].\" Run by cryptocurrency enthusiast Barry Silbert, Digital Currency Group participated in Silvergate's latest funding round and invests in about 20 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its subsidiary, CoinDesk, was the host of the Consensus conference. Wall Street banks have been hesitant to take on bitcoin-related clients, and many have banned customers from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrency. Barclays in the U.K. is among the few large banks to offer banking services in the space, and is working with start-ups Coinbase and Circle. Goldman is an investor in Circle. Apart from money laundering concerns, the crypto market was simply too small for most big banks to notice. Until last year, when bitcoin neared the $20,000 mark, the industry was a blip on the radar of regulators and most investors. Silvergate \"saw this opportunity when others didn't, to start banking the cryptocurrency companies in the space,\" Digital Currency Group's Scher said. \"The bigger banks didn't want to do this.\" Hesitance from others on Wall Street has opened up the doors for other small regional banks. They include Metropolitan Bank and Cross River Bank in Fort Lee, N.J., which are also working with cryptocurrency companies, according to people familiar with the banks. A new payment network But Silvergate appears to have an edge because of how it is using its network of cryptocurrency clients. Rather than just providing a place to store money, the bank has become somewhat of a clearinghouse, facilitating real-time transactions that can otherwise take days. \"Being able to move the payments efficiently is probably one of the biggest things holding back the space,\" said Chad Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, which owns cryptocurrency exchange itBit. \"One of the difficult issues is not actually moving crypto assets. Moving the payments is the hard part.\" Silvergate customers can transfer U.S. dollars to other Silvergate bank accounts in what's known as the Silvergate Exchange Network. This network effect helped the bank double its customer base in the first quarter through word of mouth, the CEO said. If a Silvergate customer wants to do business with someone who doesn't have a Silvergate account, they have to initiate a wire or ACH transfer, which can take longer. \"The primary benefit people see when they're signing up with us is the ability to participate in the Silvergate Exchange Network,\" Lane said. \"It becomes really powerful and our clients are the ones reaching out to others saying are you on the network? Are you a client of Silvergate?\" Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency marketplace in the U.S., did not dispute a report it is working with the bank. Previously, Coinbase was cut loose twice by Silicon Valley Bank, according to Mark Williams, a Boston University professor and a former Federal Reserve Bank examiner. \"Silvergate appears to be the only bank in town willing to sign up cryptocurrency firms whose business attracts those customers who value the privacy such products can provide,\" Williams said. \"Considering that Silvergate Bank only received Federal Reserve Bank member status in 2012, its level of asset growth is remarkable.\" Expansion plans While Silvergate has benefited from the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies, the bank has not been immune to more questionable issues that have arisen at the same time. In their five years in the space, Lane said the bank had to exit a \"handful\" of relationships with cryptocurrency companies because of compliance issues. To ensure quality clients, Lane said they heavily vet companies to make sure they don't invest in the next fraud. \"There's always going to be an element that's out of our control. Our hope is that we're doing things right on the front end, so that we're not letting in bad actors, so to speak. Not letting them in through the front door,\" he said. This year, Silvergate plans to more than double its fintech team, which includes compliance, from about 15 people to 40 people, or 20 percent of the total employee count. The bank also mitigates much of its financial risk by the amount of cash Silvergate has sitting in its accounts, according to Bert Ely, a financial institutions and monetary policy consultant. \"They obviously have very substantial customers that are keeping very big balances in these accounts,\" he said. Because it's so cash-heavy, \"Silvergate has sufficient liquid assets to handle a very substantial outflow.\" Regardless of the risks, Silvergate and its customers are in the new asset class for the long haul, betting on an influx of institutional funds that will send cryptocurrency prices climbing again. Even as bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices lost more than half their value in the first quarter, Lane said the number of Silvergate clients more than doubled. Institutional clients are generally less \"fickle\" and reactive than some retail investors, he said. \"When the prices stabilize or go down we don't see a bunch of money leaving the bank,\" Lane said. \"They're sitting there, waiting for next opportunity.\" ", "author": "Source: Elizabeth Ann Photography | Silvergate Bank", "link":

U.S. in a pending trade war after the White House took an unexpected move forward on tariffs a day earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday, citing Chinese officials. On Tuesday, the White House announced it would have a final list of $50 billion in imports that would be subject to 25 percent tariffs by June 15, and two weeks later would announce investment restrictions on Chinese acquisitions of U.S. technology. In response, China is reportedly looking to line up countries against the U.S., the Journal reported. The countries in question are mostly in Europe and Asia, where companies could benefit from China's plans to give foreign companies more open access to its markets. Tuesday's announcement came just days after the two countries announced a tentative solution. show chapters No trade war with China but no trade peace either, analyst says 11:03 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 04:53 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said any trade war would be put on ice while negotiators worked out the details. As part of that deal, China would reduce its trade advantage by buying more U.S. goods such as agricultural and energy commodities.

The drugmaker announced the review earlier this year, but Brent Saunders, its chief executive, has said he was opposed to fundamental changes to its business strategy. Still, the review considered options such as splitting up the company, selling assets, making acquisitions and using capital to buy back shares. Saunders is scheduled to make a presentation at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions investor conference in New York on Wednesday morning. Allergan, the maker of Botox, is trying to right itself after a difficult year. Its shares are down 32 percent over the last 12 months and fell nearly 2 percent in trading on Tuesday. They dropped more than 1 percent in early trading Wednesday. The sale of the units would allow Allergan to refocus on four key areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastrointestinal. Proceeds from the sales could be used to pay down debt and buy back shares. A recent note from Cowen analysts valued the women's health business at $4 billion and the infectious disease business at $2 billion. The units could attract private equity buyers, previous reports have said. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management recently got Federal Trade Commission approval to take an activist stance using his 3.7 million shares of Allergan. \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed reporting.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech this week that blockchain \u2014 the technology underlying bitcoin \u2014 has \"breakthrough\" applications. \"A new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications,\" he said Monday, according to a translation of his remarks. Xi also emphasized the need for China to focus on technological development and become the global center of science and innovation. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known application of blockchain. The technology eliminates the need for a third party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a secure and permanent record of transactions between two parties. Speculation on the enormous but still largely unproven potential of blockchain helped send bitcoin prices skyrocketing last year. Beijing has effectively halted bitcoin trading domestically, and in September officially banned sales of new digital tokens through the \"initial coin offering\" process. However, the country remains a hub of activity for blockchain development. Several start-ups are partnering with the local Chinese government to research or implement the technology. \"In China, blockchain's still developing, really great,\" said Albert Xuan, project manager at Liaoyuan, a consulting firm and incubator for start-ups. He said roughly 100 to 200 people flew from China to New York earlier this month to attend Liaoyuan's \"Blockchain Without Borders\" conference, which drew about 650 people and held at least two panels in Mandarin Chinese. Blockchain is also mentioned twice in the Chinese State Council's 13th five-year economic plan that was released in 2016. \"Since entering the 21st century, global science and technological innovation has entered into an unprecedented period of intensive activity,\" Xi said in his speech. \"A new round of scientific and industrial revolution is reconstructing the global innovation map and reshaping the global economic structure.\" Xi was addressing a meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

Profitability at parts of AK Steel remains limited, according to Goldman Sachs, despite support from President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on foreign steel. The bank downgraded shares to sell from neutral on Wednesday citing increased competition within its core automotive U.S. business . \"AK Steel shares are now trading below their level from early November 2016, having given back the gains made with the election of President Trump in November 2016, the initial run-up of the current cycle in domestic steel prices starting in November 2017, and the Department of Commerce announcement in February 2018 of more stringent-than-expected recommended Section 232 remedies,\" Goldman analyst Matthew Korn wrote Tuesday. \"Now, with our updated estimates reflecting lower forecasts for realized pricing and profitability, the risk/reward for AK Steel looks unfavorable,\" he added. Shares of AK Steel fell more than 2 percent in premarket trading following the Goldman Sachs note. Shares of the nation's major steel producers have gyrated in recent months, rising and falling on the nuances of the Trump administration's pursuit of tariffs on imports of steel. The White House's decision to push back the tariff deadline in early May, for example, sent shares of rivals U.S. Steel and Nucor down 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. Hoping to address creeping doubts over the future of the taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports \u2013 a key target of the original policy \u2013 will stay in place even as the administration suspends separate tariffs on Chinese goods. \"As it relates to China, the steel and aluminum tariffs will remain enforced,\" he said. \"Those were not part of our discussions. We were merely focused on the proposed $150 billion.\" \"Those are not being touched,\" he added. Notwithstanding the assurance from Mnuchin, AK Steel's stock price, which rallied more than 60 percent in the months immediately following President Trump's election, has tumbled back to their pre-election levels above $4.

The research found that social pressure to compete with one's neighbors on exciting new purchases is so great that it leads to a significant increase in both the amount of credit and mortgages people are willing to incur, the paper finds. \"We find that the magnitude of the neighbor's lottery win is related to the dollar value of more visible, but not less visible consumption assets,\" wrote Sumit Agarwal of Georgetown University and Vyacheslav Mikhed of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. \"The magnitude of lottery wins increases the value of risky financial assets (securities) on the balance sheets of nonlottery-winning neighbors at the time of bankruptcy filing,\" they added. \"On the other hand, the magnitude of the lottery win has no effect on cash and (weakly) decreases less risky assets.\" The researchers studied the effects a one-time income boost for one person on the financial stability of that person's neighbors. Limiting the sample to a collection of small neighborhoods in Canada, the researchers wrote, helped guarantee that neighbors witnessed any obvious changes in consumption by lottery winners. The one lucky winner, they reason, should be clear thanks to flashy purchases like a new car or a larger house. Among its main findings, the study observed that a lottery win equal to the median annual income for the communities studied increases the rate of bankruptcies among neighbors by 0.03 in the three years after the win, a 6.59 percent increase relative to the average bankruptcy rate. In turn, that type of \"conspicuous consumption\" pressures neighbors into spending more themselves. But while social pressures can lead to compelling academic theories, upticks riskier borrowing appeared to have more insidious economic implications. While the size of the lottery win didn't affect neighbors' credit in the years prior to a lottery win, the researchers found increases in both the number of accounts as well as the dollar balances after lottery wins, implying a net increase in borrowing in neighborhoods following an isolated income shock. In terms of magnitude, Agarwal and Mikhed found that a 10 percent increase in the lottery amount would buoy all credit accounts by 0.003 and total balances by $134 in the second year after the win. They also observed a shift in the housing market; according to their calculations, a 10 percent increase in the lottery prize would result in 0.0007 additional mortgages and an additional $165 in mortgage balances in the second year after the win. \"Taken together, these findings are suggestive of the increased borrowing of neighbors because of relative income comparisons, leading to financial distress,\" Agarwal and Mikhed wrote. \"While the results in this paper are based on microgeographies, [by] examining the very close neighbors of lottery winners, future research could possibly examine whether these results are important for the entire economy,\" they said.

The company itself had a record first quarter, signing 20 production contracts with new firms, Garlinghouse said.

Bitcoin lost roughly 50 percent in those three months. \"It's still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity,\" Garlinghouse said. \"I think it's a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.\" There are more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The CEO predicted that 99 percent of those digital assets won't exist in 10 years. \"There's gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don't actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,\" he said. Not only do some cryptocurrencies have no proven use case, they have been accused of fleecing investors through a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned of pump-and-dump schemes, shut multiple down, and recently charged one backed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid with fraud. \"The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed,\" Garlinghouse said. \"We have been an advocate of yes the government should get involved, the government should be protecting investors and companies but there's also examples of real utility. The issue of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security has been a major focus for the financial watchdog. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities. But Ripple has maintained that the XRP cryptocurrency should be categorized differently.

In each case, Jung accessed sensitive, market-moving information through the investment bank, which was involved in potential restructuring or acquisition deals, according to the documents. In all, 37-year-old Jung and his 38-year-old co-conspirator traded in securities of 12 different companies based on the material, nonpublic information and generated profits of about $140,000 between 2015 and 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate complaint Thursday. Jung purchased securities using a brokerage account held in the name of Sungrok Hwang, a friend living in South Korea, the SEC said.

But its flagship product is not even live yet. Block.one is funding its blockchain platform called eos.ios through a process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. Its multibillion-dollar fundraising effort more than doubles the next biggest offering of that type. But investors still don't know how the majority of that capital will be used. Many have been pouring in money based on hype and a promise that its founders, who have run other well-known blockchain projects, can repeat their success. Through the ICO, Block.one is offering a cryptocurrency called eos. Unlike an IPO, which gives investors stock ownership in a company, an ICO gives out tokens whose use case is based on a promise the platform will be useful in a digital network once it gets built. show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 1:48 PM ET Tue, 25 Sept 2018 | 03:13 Participants in the ICO used cryptocurrency ether instead of U.S. dollars in exchange for the new eos tokens. The fundraising brought in 7.12 million in total ether as of Wednesday night, according to Token Report, a division of blockchain advisory firm New Alchemy. At Thursday's U.S. dollar exchange rate of $576 per ether, the ICO has brought in the equivalent of $4.1 billion. This amount could change depending on the price of ether once the sale closes. In a March episode of \"Last Week Tonight,\" talk show host John Oliver highlighted eos in a monologue warning viewers about the \"speculative mania\" and risks of investing in cryptocurrency. \"It can be incredibly hard to tell which companies are for real,\" Oliver said during the episode, which has 5.98 million views on YouTube. \"If you want a good example of this, look at Block.one, which has raised $1.5 billion.\" \"It hasn't launched yet,\" Oliver said. He listed a host of concerns: the apparent lack of seriousness by advisor and noted early bitcoin investor Brock Pierce, the exponential pace of fundraising relative to established tech giants such as Facebook, and a Wall Street Journal report that called eos \"a software startup that doesn't plan to sell any software.\" The system, according to its founders, will support more efficient operations for \"decentralized applications\" than existing platforms such as ethereum. If eos.ios is successful, advocates say it could bring on much greater adoption of cryptocurrency-related technology. But they still have a lot to prove when the product goes live June 1. \"They have set the bar very high for themselves in terms of delivery expectations,\" said William Mougayar, managing partner at JM3 Capital and author of \"The Business Blockchain.\" \"Now is the time to not just deliver the coins but the technology with it.\" Mougayar called Block.one an anomaly, on the \"extreme\" side of the fundraising spectrum. The biggest IPO this year, AXA Equitable Holdings, raised $2.8 billion in its May 10 offering, while ADT raised $1.5 billion in January, according to data from Pitchbook. Cryptocurrency prices have sputtered this year. Bitcoin, for example, has lost more than 45 percent of its value in 2018 after rising more than 1,300 percent last year, according to CoinDesk. But investors are still betting on coin offerings, despite some being pegged as frauds. The group behind messaging app Telegram raised $1.7 billion through private investors but canceled its public cryptocurrency sale this year. ICOs raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to research firm Autonomous Next. \"This is the crypto world we live in,\" Mougayar said. \"The eos founders have done a great job at marketing their technology, ahead of its delivery.\" Top 10 ICO fundraises besides Block.one Telegram Open Network \u2014 $1.7 billion Dragon Coin \u2014 $320 million Huobi \u2014 $300 million HDac \u2014 $258 million Filecoin \u2014 $257 million Tezos \u2014 $232 million Sirin Labs \u2014 $157.9 million Bancor \u2014 $152 million Bankera \u2014 $150.9 million Polkadot \u2014 $142.4 million Source: New Alchemy Other pundits say faith in Brendan Blumer, the company's CEO, and Dan Larimer, its chief technology officer, are the reason investors trust that the start-up will deliver. Larimer has founded two high-profile crypto companies, Bitshares and Steemit. \"Dan is among the most accomplished blockchain developers on the planet,\" said Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, which is an investor in eos. \"He's well respected in the space and well-accomplished.\" Similar to how Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out for operating system dominance, blockchain companies could be entering a dogfight. Companies are competing to have developers use their code to build what are known as \"decentralized\" applications. But this competition will have at least 10 companies instead of two and \"it's going to be much messier,\" Samani said. \"In this market, the answer is raise as much money as possible,\" he said. \"It's plausible that we look back and say the team that spent the most money won the tech war.\" Having the amount of capital Block.one does could give the platform a leg up, even if the launch this weekend is rocky. The company has already said it will spend $1 billion of its bounty recruiting developers, with billions more to hypothetically spend on lobbying global regulators and building relationships with banks.

gains not in cards this year, Citi\u2019s top market watcher says 5:19 PM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 02:11 Citigroup's top market watcher isn't letting geopolitical jitters rattle his stock market forecast. In an interview on CNBC's \"Futures Now,\" Tobias Levkovich said it's too premature to make investment decisions on whether a trade war will erupt over Trump tariffs, or if Italy's political crisis will spark a contagion. \"That's kind of geopolitical risks akin to what if there's a war with Iran. So, we don't predict those. If they occur, we have to react and we have to hedge portfolios,\" the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist said Thursday. His thoughts came as stocks tried to battle back into positive territory for the week. The Dow ultimately ended Friday securely in the green, gaining 219 points to close at 24,635. But it wasn't enough to give the Dow a winning week. The S&P 500 fared better. The index gained more than 1 percent to close around 2734, and saw its second positive week in a row. But by all accounts, Levkovich's stock market forecast isn't the rosiest. He's predicting a choppy year. \"We're actually trying to take advantage of some of the slowdown or the pullback,\" he said. He's particularly interested in select industrials, financials and energy. The groups have been showing weakness after 10-Year Treasury yields backed off levels over 3 percent. \"We still think bond yields are heading higher. Wage inflation is coming,\" said Levkovich. \"By the next six months, we should see higher yields which then benefit financials.\" Levkovich's S&P 500 year-end target is 2800, but his 2019 mid-year forecast isn't much higher. \"If you look at a 12 month time horizon, you'll probably get up to the high 2800s,\" he said. \"You're still talking about 7 or 8 percent total market return in terms of appreciation.\" Levkovich acknowledged his forecast may be disappointing to investors who want a record-breaking, double-digit performance like last year, adding \"We're all greedy.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

In fact, she said the U.S. market has been overweight from a combination of added stimulus from tax reform, a February spending package that filters into government agencies and global turmoil that benefits the U.S. market. \"We've found over the last few decades, when you have market panic, even if the U.S. causes the panic, the U.S. tends to outperform,\" Patterson said Wednesday on \"Fast Money.\" \"Some of that is Americans bringing money home in times of stress, and we bring a lot of money home,\" said Patterson, who serves as managing director and chief investment officer at Bessemer, a privately owned wealth management firm. \"And it's also that capital repatriation lifts the dollar,\" she said. The U.S. market fell sharply Tuesday with all three major indices closing lower. Amid concerns about Italy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 500 points at its lows. But the market rallied Wednesday as the Dow jumped more than 300 points and banks rebounded. The S&P 500 also rose, adding 1.27 percent and closing at 2,724.01. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 index hit a record, adding 1.5 percent and closing at 1,647.99. In the European markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 and Italy's FTSE MIB also rallied. But Patterson pointed out that, in the last month, the FTSE MIB, the benchmark stock market index for the Borsa Italiana, the Italian National Stock Exchange, has been down about 10 percent. \"There's a decent probability you get a populist government [in Italy],\" Patterson said. \"If you get a populist government, it would be very hard for the ECB, the central bank, to continue buying Italian bonds as part of its quantitative easing program.\" \"I would prefer to put my money somewhere else right now,\" she said. And it's not just Italy that Patterson expressed concerns about: The Japanese Nikkei 225 is down approximately 9 percent in the last month, and Brazil's Bovespa is down about 13 percent since February.

Here's why 8:04 AM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 03:00 The Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulatory agencies proposed Wednesday to revise the Volcker Rule to apply to financial firms based on their trading activity. \"This proposed rule will tailor the Volcker rule's requirements by focusing the most comprehensive compliance regime on the firms that do the most trading,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. \"Firms that do more modest amounts of trading will face fewer requirements.\" The Volcker Rule was proposed during the financial crisis in an effort to prevent banks from speculating in markets. The rule went into effect four years ago and generally prevents banks from trading for their own profit or having stakes in a hedge fund or private equity fund. Wednesday's proposal allows banks to have stakes in those funds in order to hedge risks for customers that aren't banks. The financial firms would also be able to trade for themselves on a limited basis, under the proposal. To determine the level of necessary compliance, the proposal divides banks into three categories. Those with trading assets and liabilities of at least $10 billion would need to comply with the strictest rules. Banking entities with trading assets and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion would be subject to \"reduced compliance requirements and a more tailored approach.\" Firms with less than $1 billion in worldwide trading assets and liabilities would be presumed compliant with parts of the rule and not have to demonstrate compliance. The proposal also said trading desks reporting an absolute daily net gain and loss for the past 90 days not exceeding $25 million would be presumed compliant with the prohibition on proprietary trading. \"The banking entity would have no obligation to demonstrate that such trading desk's activity complies with the rule on an ongoing basis.\" \"All of that is to say, I view this proposal as an important milestone in comprehensive Volcker rule reform, but not the completion of our work,\" the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, Randal K. Quarles, said in a statement.

The U.S. soybean industry is on edge again as relations with China have turned south. The Trump administration is trying to get Beijing to commit to multi-year purchase agreements, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with both sides of the matter. Those goods include U.S. soybeans, beef and poultry, the report said. But Chinese officials have been reluctant to commit, the sources told the newspaper. \"We don't expect these talks to be that fruitful,\" John Ferguson, director of global forecasting at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC. \"We expect the U.S. and China to move forward with the tariffs. For the U.S. agriculture sector, that means soybeans.\" A U.S. team is in Beijing for trade talks ahead of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' planned arrival in the city on Saturday. Members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies are involved in the discussions with China, which in 2017 was the second-largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, according to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. In early April, China's Ministry of Commerce put soybeans on its list of planned tariffs in retaliation against proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. After a pause in the trade dispute in late May, the Trump administration said Tuesday it would move forward with releasing a list of Chinese goods that will be subject to 25 percent tariffs. \"The Chinese side has confidence, capability and experience to defend the interests of our country and her people,\" the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Wednesday. \"We urge the U.S. to act in the spirits of the joint statement.\" Hopes were lifted about two weeks ago when the U.S. and China said they \"agreed on meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports.\" That week, soybean futures recovered from their lowest in more than a month to settle at their highest in three weeks. Prices have since fallen about 3 percent and were trading little changed Friday afternoon near $10.22 a bushel. On the other hand, shares of U.S. farm equipment manufacturer Deere climbed more than 2.5 percent amid broad stock market gains. \"We're confused right now,\" said Bret Davis, partner at Davis Farms in Ohio and a member of the governing board of the American Soybeans Association. I \"hope it's still a way to bring [Beijing] to the table, but still very anxious as a soybean farmer.\" In a report Thursday, the USDA Economic Research Service said that due to slower U.S. soybean exports to China, the agency expects overall exports of the crop will fall $100 million to $21.9 billion for fiscal year 2018.

But in this kind of fight, history seems to indicate there are very few winners. Economists are warning about hypothetical scenarios where Trump takes it too far, and other countries strike back, inevitably sending the global trade community down a spiraling path of retaliation. That scenario played out in almost real time this week. The White House on Thursday unveiled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and European Union countries. And those countries swiftly announced they would retaliate with their own tariffs and trade actions. No one knows exactly what will unfold, but if history is any indicator, we can make a pretty good guess. There have been a number of trade battles in the last 80 years. Reagan imposed some pretty significant tariffs on Japan in the 1980s. And in the '90s, countries were agreeing to stricter rules under the World Trade Organization. More recently, former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. He was met with threats of retaliation from European trading partners. And soon after, he ended the tariffs. Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images George W. Bush But in one case, a trade war had dire global consequences. Let's take it back to the 1930s. America was turning inward with protectionist policies. The government was restricting trade with other countries. And in an effort to save U.S. factories, a couple of congressmen came up with a plan. It was formally called the Tariff Act of 1930, but it's more commonly known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The plan faced a lot of opposition, but it ultimately became law. The act raised tariffs on American imports to nearly record levels. But instead of reviving the economy, it actually exacerbated the Great Depression. Nations across the world were striking each other with tit-for-tit tariffs. European countries put a tax on American goods, which slowed trade between the U.S. and Europe. That made it harder for the U.S. to crawl out of its economic slump. Nationalist rhetoric was heating up, with countries blaming others for their struggles. All of that eventually escalated, turning a trade war into a real war when World War II began. That's why after the war ended, nations formed the World Trade Organization to regulate international trade, in the hopes that nothing like the global trade war of the 1930s would ever happen again.

As a whole, cryptocurrencies have declined about 65 percent from their highs this year, he said. \"It's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,\" Morehead said Thursday on \"Fast Money.\" Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, reached highs of $19,500 last December, only to dip below $6,000 in February. On Thursday evening at 5:30 p.m. ET, bitcoin was priced around $7,500. The volatile nature of all cryptocurrencies has left market watchers on edge amid looming regulatory concerns. Cryptocurrency is still a largely unregulated industry. But this might work in investors' favor, Morehead said. \"Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,\" he said. \"Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we're hearing about come online, they'll already have their positions.\" His tip for investors: Buy a currency once it breaks its 230-day moving average, wait a year and sell. \"Without even thinking about it,\" Morehead said, \"you make an average of 239 percent.\" The trader said this strategy is best illustrated in bitcoin, a coin in which it \"happened about five times in the last six years,\" he said. \"That's the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average,\" Morehead said. \"So today is a good day to be buying.\" Pantera Capital Management, which Morehead founded in 2013, is one of the first U.S. bitcoin firms. The company owns about 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including XRP, ethereum and bitcoin.

The chances of a landslide victory for Mexico's far-left presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, are growing and that is scaring investors. Mexico's benchmark stock index, the S&P/BMV IPC, plummeted 7.6 percent in May, marking its biggest one-month decline since February 2009. The iShares MSCI Mexico exchange-traded fund (EWW) \u2014 which tracks Mexican stocks \u2014 plunged 13.4 percent last month, its largest monthly loss since September 2011. The move lower in Mexican stocks comes as Lopez Obrador, better known as AMLO, extended his lead over his opponents last month. show chapters NAFTA good for US, Mexico, and Canada, says former Mexican President Fox 3:42 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 01:08 A poll conducted by Mexican daily Reforma between May 24 and May 27 showed 52 percent of voters would choose AMLO to become the country's next president, up from 48 percent in late April. Parametria, a polling agency based in Mexico City, found AMLO's preference among voters grew to 45 percent in late May from 38 percent earlier in the month. People are realizing that AMLO might not just win the July 1 contest, but win by a landslide, said Jorge Mariscal, emerging markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. \"There was an expectation that he would win, but that he would have a check from other parties in congress.\" \"If he wins by a landslide, it is a given that his party, Morena, will get significant participation in congress. It's not clear that they will get the 51 percent majority, but it's certainly possible,\" Mariscal said. He added that a congressional majority for AMLO's Morena party would allow him to change the constitution. Some of AMLO's proposals include giving free access to telecommunication services like the internet and doubling the pension for the elderly. He also said in his platform that salaries \"will rise as a principle of justice and to promote domestic consumption and markets.\" AMLO's rise to the top of the polls and the fall in Mexican equities come as Mexico continues negotiations with Canada and the United States on a new trade deal. President Donald Trump has railed against the current deal, NAFTA, calling it the worst ever. Trade tensions between the three countries rose this week after the Trump administration said it would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico. Both Canada and Mexico said they would retaliate against the tariffs, stoking more fears of a potential trade war between the U.S. and key partners. Larry McDonald, head of U.S. macro strategies at ACG Analytics and editor of The Bear Traps Report, said he thinks the sell-off in Mexican stocks has been overdone, noting that a lot of the risks for those assets \u2014 including NAFTA and the election \u2014 are already known. \"We could bounce 10 percent from here, but whether they can hold those gains will depend on AMLO. He has to move closer to the center.\" ", "author": "Alan Ortega | Reuters", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/investors-are-running-away-from-mexico-stocks-as-amlo-lead-grows.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Alan Ortega", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Reuters Leftist", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the National Regeneration Movement", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Zitacuaro", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "May 28, 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the S&P/BMV IPC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "7.6 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one-month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "February 2009", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "The iShares MSCI Mexico exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "13.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "monthly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "September 2011", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Lopez Obrador", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Fox 3:42 PM ET Mon", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "23 April 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Reforma", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "between May 24", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "May 27", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "52 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "48 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "late April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mexico City", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "45 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "late May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "38 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "earlier in the month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "July 1", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Jorge Mariscal", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "UBS Wealth Management", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Morena", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "51 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Mariscal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Morena party", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Larry McDonald", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "ACG Analytics", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The Bear Traps Report", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mexican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "AMLO", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "The chances of a landslide victory for Mexico's far-left presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, are growing and that is scaring investors.", "title": "Investors are running away from Mexican stocks as leftist pulls ahead in the polls", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/01/105245285-RTX66LTZ.jpg?v=1527867143"}, {"time": "2018-06-01T18:14:51-0400", "body": " David McNew | Newsmakers | Getty Images A view of the power lines as evening settles. A cyberattack of devastating proportions is not a matter of if, but when, numerous security experts believe. And the scale of it, one information security specialist said this week, will be such that it will have its own name \u2014 like Pearl Harbor or 9/11. \"The more I speak to people, the more they think that the next Pearl Harbor is going to be a cyberattack,\" cybersecurity executive and professional hacker Tarah Wheeler told a panel audience during the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) annual forum in Paris. \"I think that the most horrifying cybersecurity attack is going to have its own name and I think it's going to involve something more terrifying than we've thought of yet.\" Wheeler is CEO and principal security advisor at Red Queen Technologies, a cybersecurity fellow at Washington, D.C.-based think tank New America, and former cybersecurity czar at multinational software firm Symantec. Explaining her premonition, Wheeler pointed to vital health and transport infrastructure she described as grossly under-protected. \"I think about the fact that most American healthcare technology is secured, if at all, with ancient, crumbling security infrastructure. I think of planes full of people, the kind of infrastructure that protects flu vaccinations. I think about fertility clinics losing years' worth of viable embryos,\" she said, stressing that people are not paying attention to that crumbling infrastructure. Critical infrastructure and industry Wheeler is not alone in her apocalyptic outlook. Not a single report from technology companies and researchers in this field claims that the cyberthreat environment is becoming less hostile or less significant. The World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Risks Report 2018 names cyberattacks and cyber warfare as a top cause of disruption in the next five years, coming only after natural disasters and extreme weather events. \"In a worst-case scenario, attackers could trigger a breakdown in the systems that keep societies functioning,\" the report said. Industry and critical infrastructure like power grids and water purification systems could be potential targets for hackers, whether they are small groups or state actors. show chapters Adm. Stavridis: We need to think about this cyberattack as a pandemic 7:58 AM ET Mon, 15 May 2017 | 03:06 Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who served as NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, echoed these warnings in a prior interview with CNBC: \"We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector... we need to think about this cyberattack as a pandemic.\" Artificial intelligence-focused security firm BluVector reported in February that almost 40 percent of all industrial control systems and critical infrastructure faced a cyberattack at some point in the second half of 2017. Unpatchable devices and the internet of things Companies and governments aren't doing enough to protect these systems, Wheeler said. \"The inevitability is based in the easy access to the kinds of exploits that still work 10, 15, 20 years after they've been revealed,\" she said, noting that there are still companies running critical infrastructure, including health infrastructure, on Windows XP and other platforms that are unpatchable \u2014 meaning they can't be updated for vulnerability and bug fixes. Many internet of things (IOT) devices, she described, are unpatchable by design. Valentyn Ogirenko | Reuters A message demanding money is seen on a monitor of a payment terminal at a branch of Ukraine's state-owned bank Oschadbank after Ukrainian institutions were hit by a wave of cyber attacks earlier in the day, in Kiev, Ukraine, June 27, 2017. IOT, which has been described as \"merging physical and virtual worlds, creating smart environments\" through devices connected to the internet and that communicate with one another, represents a whole new level of vulnerabilities. And cybercriminals have an exponentially increasing number of potential targets, the WEF report said, \"because the use of cloud services continues to accelerate and the internet of things is expected to expand from an estimated 8.4 billion devices in 2017 to a projected 20.4 billion in 2020.\" The chief executive of defense firm Raytheon International, John Harris, recently called cyberattacks the \"single biggest threat to global security,\" adding that \"the more we are connected, the more we are vulnerable.\" Listen to the hackers But Wheeler didn't specify who would likely be behind such acts, stressing that the nature of cyber warfare is asymmetric \u2014 and while there are state actors with hostile intentions, cyber weapons are accessible to just about anyone with the skills to deploy them. What's needed, Wheeler stressed, is \"sensible, deep, not broad, cybersecurity regulation that has teeth.\" She urged the private sector to listen to its \"early warning system\" \u2014 what she called the information security community, or hackers \u2014 rather than criminalizing their activity. Industry experts have encouraged best practices and a greater awareness of the threats across the public and private sectors, and call on both sides to improve collaboration. Niklas Halle'n | AFP | Getty Images The unprecedented global cyberattack has hit more than 200,000 victims in scores of countries, Europol said on May 14, 2017, warning that the situation could escalate when people return to work. In Britain, the attack disrupted care at National Health Service facilities, including The Royal London Hospital, part of the largest NHS Trust in England. The last two years have tested relations between countries amid allegations of Russian election hacking in the U.S. and cyberthreats emanating from North Korea, Iran and China, among others. In March, the Donald Trump administration blamed Russia for a string of cyberattacks going back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid. International attacks like the WannaCry virus, which affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries and NotPetya, the alleged Russian-directed attack that caused $300 million in damages to multinational companies, may be just a small glimpse of what is on the horizon.

in crypto world that could change the space 7:28 PM ET Fri, 1 June 2018 | 07:14 Investors now have a new way to purchase cryptocurrencies using U.S. dollars. Bittrex, a Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange, has struck an agreement that allows investors to buy digital coins with American dollars. In the past, only coins traded on Coinbase, a digital currency exchange in California, could be bought with dollars. That is a fraction of the approximately 1500 digital coins floating around the universe of cryptocurrenices. To buy any of the other coins, investors had to convert their money to bitcoin first. Now they have Bittrex. Founder and CEO Bill Shihara told CNBC that the goal is to \"expand out to as many markets as possible on Bittrex,\" he said on \"Fast Money\" Friday. \"As well as expand it so that every customer on Bittrex will be able to have access to U.S. dollar trading,\" he said. The exchange might even help move the market. Since so many alt coins could only be purchased by way of bitcoin, the value of bitcoin and many other digital currencies were closely correlated. The value of those crypto units may now begin to decouple from bitcoin, Shihara said, as more investors transact in dollars. Currently, nearly 200 different digital coins can be traded on Bittrex. The CEO said that a \"small, select number of launch partners\" are working with the exchange to pay in dollars. \"In this phase, we're stress-testing our system,\" he said. \"We're working with the banks very closely to ensure that they can process the FIAT deposits and withdrawals. Also, the engine itself that we use to trade, is going to be able to properly handle the load.\" Cryptocurrency is still largely unregulated in the United States, which has led many financial institutions and investors to be cautious of the coins, amid a landscape of widespread fraud and fake ICOs. Other traders have sought out foreign markets to invest in digital assets like bitcoin. But Shihara said working with U.S. regulatory agencies on better ways to use cryptocurrency will add value to the space. \"We think that solving the regulatory puzzle in the United States really unlocks a lot of capital that really can't trade on a foreign exchange that doesn't have proper [anti-money laundering] controls or proper compliance,\" Shihara said.

Lastly, adjacent businesses, including OnStar, GM Financial and the company's aftermarket business, could add between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in profit over the next few years. \"That's another 10 bucks a share,\" said the analyst. Shares of General Motors were trading around $43 on Friday. But Susanin said it's worth closer to $75. New investments in self-driving vehicles will also help drive the stock higher. On Thursday, General Motors announced that SoftBank Vision Fund plans to invest $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, helping boost the company's stake in autonomous vehicles. Shares surged about 11 percent after the announcement. \"This is a very big deal,\" Susanin said. He said the company's market cap \u2014 currently close to $61 billion \u2014 will only continue to expand after GM launches a commercialized autonomous ride share, if the company can maintain lower prices than competitors such as Uber. GM said it will have the necessary capital to reach commercialization at scale in 2019. But investors have known about many of the strategies employed in GM's base business for some time, said Jamie Albertine, managing partner and automotive analyst at Consumer Edge Research, a research firm. And they likely won't move the market. \"On the pullout of GM Europe, we've known that for some time,\" Albertine said on \"Closing Bell\" Friday. He also pointed out that GM is overexposed in its car business in the United States and that the trucking business isn't growing that much. \"GM probably is in the best position of its OEM peers right now,\" Albertine said, referring to companies with goods used as parts in other company's products. \"But to see it double in two years, we think it's low probability,\" he said. \"It'll take more like five to seven years for this to play out, in our view.\" Disclaimer ", "author": "SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/general-motors-stock-will-double-in-next-two-years-analyst.html", "keywords": [{"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "6:43 PM ET Fri", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "1", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the next two years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Christopher Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Levin Capital Strategies", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "about $30", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "about $10", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Closing Bell", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Asian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Cadillac", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Korea", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a couple billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Cadillac", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "almost a dollar", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "maybe 75 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "almost another $10", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "OnStar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "GM Financial", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "between $1.5 billion and $2 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the next few years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "around $43", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "75", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SoftBank Vision Fund", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$2.25 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "GM Cruise Holdings", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 11 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Susanin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "close to $61 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Uber", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jamie Albertine", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Consumer Edge Research", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "GM Europe", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Albertine", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Closing Bell", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "GM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Albertine", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more like five to seven years", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Disclaimer", "category": "FAC"}], "description": "An analyst predicts General Motors stock will double in the next two years.

The partial inclusion of the A shares \u2014 yuan-denominated stocks traded on the mainland \u2014 to MSCI's Emerging Markets Index takes place in two phases, with the second step only coming in August. Among the names included were a mix of financials, consumer and developer names such as Kweichow Moutai, which makes premium liquor; BYD, an electric vehicle manufacturer; China's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Ping An Insurance. ZTE, the telecommunications equipment company currently banned from purchasing U.S. technology, and four other names were not added, MSCI said earlier in the week. Upon completion of initial A shares inclusion, China's proportion of the index \u2014 which currently includes shares of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong \u2014 will stand at 31.3 percent. Full inclusion would see A shares account for 16 percent of the index and China making up 42 percent of the index. Friday's inclusion, however, failed to buoy sentiment in greater China markets, which slipped in afternoon trade: The Shanghai composite declined 0.53 percent and the smaller Shenzhen composite fell 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was lower by 0.17 percent. The dip came after more than 1 percent gains on benchmarks in Hong Kong and on the mainland in the last session. Mostly symbolic, for now The move is seen as an important symbolic one, even though the roughly $22 billion in capital inflows expected to go into A shares is seen as a drop in the bucket compared to the size of China's domestic market. \"The quantum of dollars right now is relatively small ... but what it does is it starts a process that will include China A shares as a bigger and bigger component of this very important benchmark over time,\" Jon Howie, head of equity index strategy at BlackRock, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" show chapters The pros and cons of China's A-shares MSCI EM inclusion 3:06 AM ET Fri, 1 June 2018 | 04:41 Although the move will have a limited impact on the A share market, it was still an extremely significant step in the opening-up process of China's capital account, said Haibin Zhu and Karen Li, J.P. Morgan's chief China economist and head of China equity research, respectively. \"China's equity market now officially enters the global space,\" the J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note. A full inclusion in the future would also suggest more changes on the horizon for the mainland market. \"Certainly if you get up to full weighting, then it's going to be a very different emerging markets index, but you would think also it's going to be a very different China as well,\" said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst. \"Ultimately, MSCI is agnostic on the stocks to a large extent, they're looking at them for structure: Can I get my money in and out? Is it safe to invest? Have I got some degree of investor protection? And if you're at 100 percent, then China's really opened up in quite a dramatic way,\" he added. Lingering concerns But even though the event, which was some five years in the making, \"could change the face of EM investing,\" concerns over issues such as market intervention and capital controls have persisted. \"Of course there are some issues remaining. Trading suspension is one of the issues, there is also potentially a CNH (off-shore yuan) issue. But the process is very progressive,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale. He added that MSCI's decision to give A shares the thumbs up after three years of rejecting them meant that some efforts to rectify issues had been taken by Chinese regulators and exchanges. \"Liquidity risk and market intervention, unfortunately, would be part and parcel of investing in A shares at this stage,\" Pruksa Iamthongthong, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, told CNBC's \"Street Signs.\" Still, as more institutional investors participate in the market and as regulators deal with new rules, things could \"become more conventional\" in the future, Iamthongthong said. \u2014 CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.

Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist believes the stock market is in the midst of a cyclical bear market that could last through the end of next year. \"I think we're in a rolling bear market. Every sector has gone down at least 11 or 12 percent at least once this year. Some were down 18, 19, 20 percent,\" Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Thursday. \"It's fooling everybody at the index level, but there's a lot of pain out there: Staples, homebuilders, some of these semiconductor stocks that are more cyclical are having problems.\" The strategist's comment came as the major market indexes added to their weekly losses, with the S&P 500 down 0.3 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1.2 percent since Tuesday. Markets were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. show chapters Conditions for a bear market aren't present: Lee Cooperman 2:50 PM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 03:52 But while stocks were poised for a positive return for the month of May, volatility has plagued markets since the beginning of the year, with the Dow and S&P 500 both falling more than 10 percent from their highs at one point. In turn, the bumpy trading has signaled to many market gurus that aged bull market could finally be taking a breather. While stocks remain above their lows notched earlier this year, Wilson explained his definition of a bear market varies from traditional Wall Street wisdom. \"A bear market to me doesn't [necessarily] mean the market has to go down 20 percent,\" he said. \"A bear market is a tougher environment, it's hard to make money. Volatility is a lot higher, so I don't care what kind of portfolio you're running, you can't run as much risk anymore, you just can't do it.\" The most bearish strategist tracked by CNBC, Wilson has consistently forecasted that the S&P 500 will finish the year at 2,750, implying less than 1 percent upside for the broad market index over the remaining seven months. But the sluggish returns aren't likely to abate anytime soon, Wilson warned, telling CNBC that the cyclical bear market \"could last through the end of 2019.\" Many of Wilson's comments Thursday echoed Morgan Stanley analysis earlier this month, when the bank told clients in a note that the \"end of easy\" investing was over. \"We think it's pretty obvious that the market had discounted the news on tax cuts, global growth and still supportive financial conditions,\" Wilson wrote. \"In many ways a correction or consolidation was overdue and makes perfect sense. The question is whether or not this turns into something more sinister.\" Chief among Morgan Stanley worries have been a return of inflation, uncertain political outlook and tightening monetary policy, the lack of which helped fuel the unprecedented run in the U.S. stock market over the past nine years.

But at the same time, Yardeni pointed out the president's protectionist policies are creating a lot of market anxiety. \"A lot of what's going on is noise,\" he said. \"There is still money to be made in this market.\" Based on Yardeni's market forecast: A lot of it. He has a S&P 500 Index year-end price target of 3100, a surge of about 13 percent from current levels. \"Earnings are just fabulous. I mean we had a dramatic cut in the corporate tax rate at the end of last year,\" the former New York Federal Reserve economist said. \"We should really focus on the signal. And, the strong signal is earnings.\" According to Yardeni, cyclical groups will help take the S&P 500 to those levels. He's particularly bullish on the consumer discretionary, industrials, financials and technology sectors. Plus, he believes the small cap rally will continue to rage. \"Small cap stocks are on fire, at record highs, because they are not as exposed to the global economy in currency and protectionism,\" Yardeni said.

We continue to look to broaden our core businesses, expand our franchise and find ways to enhance our growth and diversity of revenue streams.\" Goldman Sachs announced the $5 billion plan in September after being stung in recent years by a decline in fixed-income trading. The firm is the most dependent on trading revenue among the big U.S. investment banks, and its push involves growing clients beyond the hedge funds that were its historic strength. Part of the effort includes a new emphasis on consumer retail through its Marcus brand. \"We're now building a digital consumer finance platform,\" Solomon said. \"We think digital finance is at a very, very interesting pivot point. And we think we're in a position where we can be part of the disruption.\" The consumer business offers savings accounts and loans, but could ultimately spread to credit cards, mortgages, car loans, life and health insurance through Marcus, according to a bank presentation. Marcus has 1.5 million customers, made $3 billion in loans and has a total of $22 billion in deposits, said Solomon, who became sole president of the bank in March. He is considered the likely successor for CEO Lloyd Blankfein. When asked about Goldman's plans for trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Solomon said they haven't yet gone further than clearing futures for clients. ``We're extremely cautious about the space, but very open from perspective about what do our clients need,'' he said.

U.S. ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has been in Washington for a months-long effort to arrange a formal meeting between the two leaders, the publication said, citing a senior administration official. The purpose of a summit would be to resolve thorny issues between the two nations, the report said. Syria, Ukraine and nuclear-arms control are among expected discussion topics, the publication added. In 2017, Trump and Putin met twice on the sidelines of international meetings. Although Trump has been criticized frequently for not aggressively confronting Putin, Moscow and Washington have differed sharply on a range of issues \u2014 most recently the U.S.-led strike on Syria for its suspected chemical attack on civilians. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Saturday. The discussions are taking place against the backdrop of a probe by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director. His office is investigating possible ties between Trump's presidential election campaign and Russian officials, which Trump has roundly dismissed as baseless.

He added, \"We're looking closely at where we can do that.\" On Wednesday the Fed and other regulators released a proposal to loosen restrictions on bank trading activity. The so-called Volcker Rule aimed to curtain risk taking, but the banking industry has long railed against the restrictions. \"The changes that we've proposed we think will significantly reduce the burden without undermining the objective,\" Quarles said Thursday. The rule went into effect four years ago and prevented banks from trading for their own profit or investing in hedge funds and private equity funds.

The stocks of some of China's biggest companies are set to join a key global index by the close Thursday, giving ordinary U.S. investors greater access to mainland China. More than $1.9 trillion in assets is benchmarked to MSCI's Emerging Markets index, which is tracked by the EEM ETF. The index has so far excluded hard-to-access mainland Chinese-traded stocks known as A shares and only includes Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong or the U.S. But by Thursday's close, around 230 of the A shares are scheduled to be included, kicking off a process that could eventually give A shares 16 percent allocation in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and China a 42 percent weighting. \"This is a really important event that could change the face of EM investing,\" Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research for MSCI, said in a call with media Thursday morning New York time. Emerging markets includes countries such as China, India and Brazil that tend to be growing rapidly towards a developed economy. For U.S. investors looking to invest in those foreign stock markets, U.S.-traded ETFs such as BlackRock's iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) can offer access. show chapters Discussing the likely impact of China's A-share MSCI inclusion 12:38 AM ET Thu, 31 May 2018 | 02:10 According to MSCI's April 23 provisional index, Chinese stocks up for addition to the index include: BYD, an electric automaker that Warren Buffett has invested in; SAIC Motor, a major automaker with a joint venture with General Motors; Kweichow Moutai, manufacturer of a popular Chinese liquor with 53 percent alcohol; major Chinese oil producer PetroChina and China Construction Bank. MSCI announced Wednesday that five Chinese stocks, including ZTE, will not be added. Trading in shares of the telecom equipment giant has been halted since the U.S. in April banned American companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years. For Beijing, getting some of its mainland stocks added to a major global index is a major step towards its goal of opening up domestic markets to foreign investment. MSCI decided against adding the A shares for three years due to issues such as foreign market access and trading suspensions. Last June, the index company finally decided that China had made enough improvements, particularly by expanding a stock connect program to link Hong Kong's markets with that in Shenzhen as well as Shanghai. Due to daily trading limits on the Stock Connect program, MSCI said it will add the A shares in two phases. Thursday's A share inclusion will add just 2.5 percent of the market capitalization of the 230 A shares. Another 2.5 percent is set for addition to the index in August, raising China's weighting in the overall index by 0.8 percent to about 31 percent. That should result in $22 billion in inflows to Chinese A shares, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated in a Tuesday note. However, other estimates point to a more limited immediate impact. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in a May 15 report that Thursday's inclusion should result in just a $1.7 billion passive fund flow. The second phase of inclusion set for August should result in another $1.7 billion, the report said. The total $3 billion to $3.5 billion represents about 0.9 percent of the total free float market cap for A share markets, the analysts said. KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF (KBA), which seeks to track the A shares set for inclusion, traded more than 1 percent higher Thursday afternoon. EEM itself has struggled this year, falling about 3 percent. But it is up 10 percent over the last 12 months and has $37.7 billion in assets.

The ratings agency also questioned whether Deutsche Bank's CEO Christian Sewing would be able to return the bank to profit. \"Let's be straightforward: the newsflow is not good... I know that the current newsflow must give you the feeling that the bank is not getting any respite. That's why I think it's important for me to put this news in perspective,\" Sewing said in a letter to staff Friday. \"At group level, our financial strength is beyond doubt,\" he added. Germany's biggest bank 'vulnerable to speculation' Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the Federal Reserve had downgraded Deutsche Bank's U.S. business to one of the lowest possible designations last year. Meanwhile, the Financial Times also reported Thursday, citing a source, that Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiary was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's list of \"problem banks,\" or those with weaknesses that threaten their financial survival. The news prompted shares of Deutsche Bank to collapse to their lowest-ever closing level Thursday. Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters Christian Sewing, CEO of Germany's Deutsche Bank, addresses the audience during the bank's annual meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, May 24, 2018. Nonetheless, in in his letter to staff Friday, Sewing insisted that credit and market risk levels had rarely been so low, speculation it was exposed to Italian turmoil was unfounded and funding plans for 2018 were progressing at a steady pace. \"Let's face it, this is a situation where we are \u2014 if you look at our share price yesterday \u2014 vulnerable to speculation,\" Deutsche Bank's chief spokesperson, Joerg Eigendorf, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Friday. \"The management has a plan, the management is executing on their plan and I can promise you there is no lack of determination,\" he added.

The recent death of a Chinese rural bank's chairman has put the spotlight on the troubles that small lenders in the country face as authorities clean up the financial sector in the world's second-largest economy. Yin Jinbao, who was reportedly found dead in his office on May 26 with slits on both his wrists, joined the board of Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank in July 2017 and became chairman in November. Before that, he was a director at Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank for four years. Local state media said police had ruled out homicide in their initial investigation of Yin's death. CNBC reached out to Tianjin police for comment, but has not heard back. Both the banks Yin worked at are controlled by the local government in Tianjin, a port city in northeastern China that's home to around 15.5 million people. Rural commercial banks are a category of small lenders in the country set up to support the agriculture sector and small and micro firms in the rural areas. Yin's suspected suicide came at a time when Chinese authorities have stepped up their inspection at troubled state-controlled companies. A May 2 notice by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said investigation teams had been dispatched to 22 state firms in Tianjin, including the two banks at which Yin worked. show chapters Chinese banks could face pressure ahead: Fitch 1:44 AM ET Mon, 27 Nov 2017 | 01:51 Several reports by Chinese media outlets suggested Yin's death could be related to the ongoing probe. Caixin Global, for one, quoted a source close to Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank saying Yin \"could not bear the pressure of the investigation once problems began to surface.\" Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank and Tianjin Binhai Rural Commercial Bank did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment. The 2017 annual reports of both lenders revealed above-average levels of bad loans and the struggle to remain financially strong. Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank reported a 9.3 percent fall in revenue in 2017 but its net profit jumped 21.9 percent. Tianjin Binhai fared worse: Its revenue and net profit slumped by 46.3 percent and 41.8 percent, respectively. Bad debt was 2.48 percent of overall loans at Tianjin, and 2.29 percent at Tianjin Binhai \u2014 higher than the national level of 1.74 percent for 2017. Troubles facing small banks in China The banks' financial standing contrasted with larger peers such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which saw profitability and asset quality improve last year as China doubled down on efforts to cut excessive debt and risky financial undertakings. \"The main takeaway from FY17 is that size matters especially in the context of efforts to reduce systemic debt and financial risk,\" analysts from CreditSights wrote in an April note after China's listed banks reported their 2017 earnings. They explained that larger banks have a more stable base of deposits and can choose to lend to companies with stronger finances. Meanwhile, many small banks borrow at high interest rates from their mega peers for funding and have more exposure to risky shadow activities. show chapters The investment case for Chinese banks 1:51 AM ET Thu, 29 March 2018 | 02:54 Both Tianjin and Tianjin Binhai are small, private companies very rarely covered by research houses and rating agencies. Details of their business activities are therefore scarce, but the latter made headlines several times over the last few years for its financial problems. In 2014, the bank had illegally used company money to buy off-balance sheet asset management products issued by Hengfeng bank, according to a report by Caixin Global. It was also one of the creditors for Bohai Steel Group, which struggled with its 192 billion yuan ($29.95 billion) debt. Rural commercial banks such as Tianjin and Tianjin Binhai account for 13 to 14 percent of the total assets and liabilities in China's banking system, according to statistics by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. They may be small, but they could pose risks to China's economic progress, a Financial Times opinion piece noted in May. Such banks depend highly on their local economy to keep their businesses going. Tianjin province, for its part, recorded the smallest growth among China's 29 municipalities and regions last year. It grew 3.6 percent in 2017, which was down sharply from the 9 percent in the previous year.

In 2015, brokers working on behalf of a mystery client in London, offered these funds the chance to make a trade they thought was impossible to lose: betting that a teetering Norwegian paper company would imminently default on its debt. The hedge funds snapped up hundreds of millions of dollars of the derivatives contracts that would pay out in the event of a default. By the time the buyers realised who was on the other side of the trade it was too late: they had been trapped. One hedge fund manager recalls receiving a call from a sympathetic contact pleading with him to exit a trade. \"It was an off-the-record warning in order to protect me,\" he says. \"He basically told me who was on the other side. It was him.\" The \"him\" was Akshay Shah, at the time a managing director at the Blackstone Group's GSO hedge fund unit, who for nearly a decade spearheaded a series of unconventional trades that made him the most feared operator in European credit markets, terrorising a string of rival hedge funds and costing them millions in trading losses. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The aftermath of the complex trades Mr. Shah helped pioneer have shaken the $10tn market for credit default swaps to its core, leaving a trail of at least three lawsuits and recriminations between the world's largest private equity group and some of the most powerful names in finance. The trades have also highlighted a shift in the balance of power on Wall Street since the financial crisis, where the so-called non-bank lenders such as GSO have leveraged the infrastructure and reach of parent private equity groups to become more feared than the once dominant proprietary trading desks of Goldman Sachs and the other leading investment banks. \"This is symbolic of a shift in power away from banks like Goldman to non-bank institutions like Blackstone,\" says a former Goldman Sachs partner. The credit default swap, a financial instrument intimately associated with the losses incurred by the banks during the US subprime mortgage crisis, is most commonly used to either hedge against a company falling into trouble and possibly not paying off its debts, or as a tool of outright speculation over whether a default will occur. How it worked 1. GSO buys a CDS contract on a struggling company from another hedge fund. The CDS is like an insurance contract: it pays out if the company defaults. 2. GSO then approaches the company and offers it very attractive financing (a low interest loan for example) with an unusual condition: it has to default in a way that will trigger a payout on the CDS contract. 3. The company carries out this proposal, for example by paying interest on a bond a few days late, causing little concern to bondholders but \"triggering\" the CDS contracts 4. The hedge fund then has to pay a lump sum to GSO given that the company has defaulted The GSO unit at Blackstone where Mr. Shah worked became the biggest predator in the global CDS market by going beyond merely trying to predict when companies would fail. Instead it used Blackstone's substantial influence to directly intervene in struggling businesses, changing their fates in ways that maximised profits on GSO's trades. The strategy allowed GSO, which has $140bn of assets under management, to radically alter the odds in its favour by inventing a trade that had never been seen before: the manufactured default. It is the debt equivalent of a controlled explosion: offering a company favourable financing, such as low interest loans, to convince it to intentionally default in a way that will trigger payouts on CDS contracts, but without bringing down the whole company. By doing this GSO pushed its trading edge on rivals to the limits of what many saw as legal. \"I don't believe it's classified as insider trading, but it's pretty damn close,\" says one retired trader who came up against GSO and Mr. Shah. \"It's quite frankly shocking that they were able to get away with doing that for so long and that no one was prepared to stand up to it.\" \"I compare it to sports gambling,\" says Aitan Goelman, former head of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division, about manufactured defaults. \"If gamblers went out and paid players to throw games, everyone would intuitively know that was fraudulent. Highly sophisticated and not particularly upstanding actors are looking for any edge they can get: if they see areas of the law that are vague or poorly defined, they see this as an opportunity.\" While rivals and observers are shocked at GSO's tactics, it has never been accused of breaking any regulations. GSO argues that the assistance it provides to distressed businesses in exchange for them triggering payouts on CDS contracts are welcomed by those companies as it helps them to survive, and only damages other hedge funds caught out speculating on their failure. \"Our financing solutions were determined in competitive processes and provided the most favourable terms and crucial financial support to businesses with thousands of employees,\" Blackstone said in a statement. \"They were also wholly compliant with the market's well-established rules and consistent with the expectations of its sophisticated market participants.\" So effective and surprising was GSO's strategy that it ensnared some of the most revered names in trading, including BlueCrest, founded by billionaire Michael Platt, and Goldman Sachs. BlueCrest declined to comment. The controversy this year filtered up to the highest echelons of Wall Street, as a controversial trade GSO orchestrated around struggling US homebuilder Hovnanian was discussed in a meeting between Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein and Jon Gray, president and heir apparent of Blackstone. Goldman had earlier taken the unusual step of complaining in public about manufactured defaults, with the senior trader in charge of the trade telling the FT this year that \"the Hovnanian situation could embolden investors to pursue manufactured credit events with other corporate issuers, which would undermine the true intention and spirit of the CDS market\". Having for years sat at the top of the trading food chain, observers said it would have been unthinkable in the past for a Goldman partner to complain in public about being bested in a trade. \"It is ironic any Goldman guy would be asking in public to be protected [from GSO] like this,\" says the retired Goldman partner. \"Goldman always had a phrase internally, the 'big boy letter', the letter clients sign to show they knew what the risks were of trading with Goldman.\" Rival hedge funds, investment bankers and consultants describe GSO's success as being driven by both its traders' attention to detail, as well as the unrivalled ability of Blackstone's reputation and infrastructure to support its trades. When Mr. Shah joined GSO in 2008 from Lehman Brothers, few could fault his timing \u2014 the investment bank collapsed six months later. He had built a reputation as a sharp-minded analyst on Lehman's fixed-income trading desk. And having arrived at GSO, which that year had been purchased by Blackstone, Mr. Shah began working on finding ways to make money for its investment funds in the European debt market. People familiar with his trading style say he pores over hundreds of pages of bond or loan documents, trying to find tiny details that others in the market might miss. Once he identifies chinks in the wording of particular clauses he plots a way to construct trades using derivatives on whether a company will default on its debts, which would lure rivals to take the other side. \"He's a sniper,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"He would call you up and say 'Hey, what are you doing, what are you thinking on this?' and he knows all the information already, he's just fishing for what you know and what you think so he can work around it.\" GSO would then directly approach company managements with proposals that guaranteed it would profit on the CDS. Ahead of the approach, Mr. Shah would often hire external consultants for role-playing purposes, shadowboxing with them in a specific country's law or corporate culture until the pitch was finely tuned. \"You need to have a management team willing to screw people,\" says one distressed debt investor. In the case of Codere, a cash-strapped Spanish gaming company, Mr. Shah first used the manufactured default. GSO offered the struggling company a liquidity lifeline in 2013 with an unusual condition: Codere had to pay interest on its publicly traded bonds just a few days late, causing little concern to its bondholders but triggering CDS payouts. Despite the unwanted publicity the Codere trade attracted for Blackstone \u2014 it was dissected by comedian Jon Stewart on primetime US television in 2013 \u2014 Mr. Shah grew to become one of GSO's most senior managing directors, and sat on its European investment committee. \"Akshay wasn't some cowboy,\" says a former trader. \"He was reporting into the most senior people at GSO.\" Rivals argue that GSO was uniquely placed to not only gain access to greater information than many rivals, but could also use Blackstone's reputation to open doors to corporate management teams. \"To do these sorts of trades you need the size and the money. Only GSO had the money, the influence to pull this off,\" says one person active in the European debt markets. \"Blackstone is a great brand to have behind you.\" Mr. Shah used all the levers at Blackstone's disposal to push through one of GSO's most controversial trades in 2015-16. The tussle over the CDS of heavily indebted Norwegian paper company Norske Skog resulted in a bitterly fought court battle in New York, as rival hedge fund BlueCrest tried in vain to block GSO's gambit. The trade was essentially the opposite of Codere: charging other hedge funds large premiums to bet on a company's rapid demise before doing everything possible to keep it alive for long enough to avoid having to pay anything out. For Norske Skog, GSO pooled its firepower with rival hedge fund Cyrus to buy a substantial equity stake and then lobby for changes to its board, before getting management to formally adopt a proposal tailored to maximise the profits on the funds' CDS positions. \"We believe the company will once again run into trouble after GSO and Cyrus have cleared their CDS positions and no longer have the incentive to support the company with as much determination and creativity,\" Rahul Gandhi, an analyst at research firm CreditSights, said in March 2016. His prediction proved prescient. The CDS contracts were settled in June 2016 and 18 months later, in December 2017, Norske Skog filed for bankruptcy. By that point, Mr. Shah's career at GSO had also met a seemingly untimely end. In the spring of 2017 the scourge of London's traders suddenly parted ways with the firm, which liquidated a more than $3bn distressed debt fund he managed. One former employee of the division says the headlines such controversial CDS trades generate are no longer compensated for by the gains, as Blackstone's in-house credit unit shifts its focus to the less acrimonious practice of making direct loans to private companies. \"It's not a place that loves this publicity and in 2018 it has to look like a friendly provider of capital,\" he says. This more conciliatory approach was clearly seen in the surprising resolution to the Hovnanian trade last month. The homebuilder announced at the last minute that it was not going through with the manufactured default, as GSO and rival hedge fund Solus reached a settlement over the trade. The Blackstone unit has also in recent months struck a deal with Goldman where GSO bought back some of the contracts the bank lost money on. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The Hovnanian trade was devised and executed after Mr. Shah left GSO, but the senior GSO executive who made use of his former colleague's manufactured default template has now also left the firm, joining a rival distressed debt fund at the start of the year. Mr. Shah says he left to set up his own hedge fund in London to focus on smaller distressed debt opportunities. His new fund, Kyma Capital, is in the early stages of fundraising. \"The reason for leaving was simple: the European stressed and distressed opportunity set is a middle-market opportunity set,\" he says. \"These sized companies don't lend themselves to megafunds.\" Kyma Capital said it would \"welcome any regulatory changes that would improve the stability, durability and liquidity of the CDS markets\". But experts believe the damage to the market is already done, as the run of trades from GSO have exposed how easy it is for big players to alter outcomes in the very markets they are betting on. \"This kind of 'gaming' behaviour undermines the viability of the CDS market,\" says Henry Hu, a professor and expert in derivatives at the University of Texas Law School. \"The CDS market has shrunk terribly since the crisis. If this kind of behaviour continues, the market will shrink even further.\" \"We have heard with concern reports about recent 'manufactured' credit events,\" says a spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority. \"Such behaviour could also amount to market manipulation.\" Mr. Goelman, formerly of the CFTC, says he did look at manufactured defaults before stepping down last year, but could not say who was involved. \"For a number of different reasons, we decided to not act on the case.\" One of the hedge fund managers who came up against Mr. Shah says he expects GSO to now shy away from such trades, given the potential regulatory scrutiny. \"There are still going to be other guys out there who will be more aggressive and willing to put on these trades,\" he says, adding that it would be hard for others to replicate the intricacy of the trades pioneered by GSO. \"Being outside the behemoth of Blackstone, I don't see how that's going to work.\" More from the Financial Times:

The company announced a partnership with 17 schools Monday, including the University of North Carolina, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. Through the \"University Blockchain Research Initiative\" program, Ripple will donate $50 million for research and development in blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital payments. The donation is in dollars and not the cryptocurrency, the company said. \"As globalization increases, so does the demand for technological solutions and talent to solve the world's hardest financial problems, such as retail remittances,\" Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple's SVP of business operations, said in an email. The company said the initiative was launched in part because of a demand for jobs. More than 4,500 job openings with the terms \"blockchain\" or \"cryptocurrency\" were posted on LinkedIn last year, Ripple said, a 150 percent increase from a year earlier. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While there are countless uses for that technology, Ripple's focus is on real-time transaction settlements for banks. It has announced partnerships with U.S. money transfer giants MoneyGram and Western Union as well as American Express and Santander. Ripple is officially the name of the San Francisco-based company, which is developing a network for faster global financial payments. XRP is the name of the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. Some university research and projects will involve Ripple's technology and the cryptocurrency XRP but it is not a requirement, the company said.

Jose Manuel Barroso, now non-executive chairman at Goldman Sachs International, told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that Beijing is getting on with development in AI. \"The Chinese are not only making statements, they are investing money,\" he said at the AI Deep Dive in partnership with Feedzai at Money2020. Barroso added that his sentiment was not negative toward China and that, in the main, Chinese-led science would benefit the world. The Goldman employee said Europe, in particular, \"should not be naive\" and must defend itself by ensuring that more money is committed to AI development. He said there was evidence that this was happening with European countries that are net contributors to Brussels being asked to provide 100 billion euros ($117 billion) over the next seven years to scientific research. Barroso said Goldman Sachs itself was heavily increasing investment in AI and, at times, it felt like there were more software engineers than financiers within the company. On data privacy, Barroso said a \"revolution\" was going on after the Facebook data scandal and that stronger regulation was set to come in globally. Alongside London-based elections consultancy Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is at the center of an ongoing dispute over the alleged harvesting and use of personal data. \"I don't believe that our democracies will accept their private data not to be protected,\" Barroso said.

An official who could have a big say in whether Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. can merge is keeping an open mind. Makan Delrahim, who heads antitrust efforts for the U.S. Department of Justice, said he doesn't see reducing the number of major wireless carriers from four to three as inherently bad for the market, Bloomberg reports. \"I don't think there's any magical number that I'm smart enough to glean about any single market,\" Delrahim told reporters on Friday. Antitrust concerns are seen as one of the biggest potential hurdles for the proposed $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. The carriers control 18 percent and 14 percent, respectively of the market. Together, their market share edges out Verizon Wireless's 31 percent share and trails only AT&T's 36 percent share. Bad vibes from federal officials during the Obama administration were cited as the reason Sprint pulled back on an earlier effort to acquire T-Mobile. And while the Trump administration is seen as potentially more open to a merger, its court battle to stop an $85 billion merger of AT&T and Time Warner has given mixed signals.

He said any level to watch beyond the record high would be a psychological round number such as 8,000, or more than 5 percent above Monday's levels. The Nasdaq climbed more than half a percent Monday to within half a percent of its all-time intraday high hit on March 13. The index also set a closing record of 7,606.46, helped by an all-time high in shares of Apple, the largest stock by market capitalization. JC Parets of Allstarcharts.com said, \"7,600 is my level. If we're above that in the [Nasdaq] composite then I think we need to be very aggressively bullish Nasdaq.

As of June 1, the sector had reported 25.8 percent year-on-year earnings growth for the first quarter, according to CFRA. \"In contrast to the S&P, the Nasdaq's new closing high reinforces the case that equities markets are incrementally improving/strengthening not weakening,\" Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in an email to CNBC. \"A progression of intermediate-term, multi-month correction lows are developing across most groups with Technology one of the first sectors to bottom and continue lead to the upside. Incrementally, most other sectors are following.\" Echoing the optimistic views on technology, Frank Cappelleri of Instinet told CNBC that seeing the Nasdaq approach its highest shows that the long-term uptrend remains intact. \"Let's not forget, too, that the Small Caps have been getting a lot of deserved attention over the last weeks with the Russell 2000 first making a new high more than two weeks ago,\" he said in an email.

A former executive at State Street is set to face trial on U.S. charges that he participated in a scheme to defraud the bank's clients by charging them secret commissions on billions of dollars in trades. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in Boston in the case of Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president at the bank accused of committing securities fraud and wire fraud. McLellan is one four former employees of the Boston-based bank who have since 2016 faced charges by the U.S. Justice Department that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. Two of those former executives \u2014 Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt \u2014 pleaded guilty last year and are expected to testify at trial, according to court papers. McLellan, 46, has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. In January 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. According to prosecutors, McLellan, Pennings, Boomgaardt, and others from 2010 to 2011 conspired to add the secret commissions for trades performed for the six clients, which had been utilizing bank's \"transition management\" business. That service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments. The six clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund and Irish and British government pension funds, according to court papers. Prosecutors say that McLellan also participated in a separate scheme to apply hidden fees to fixed-income trades conducted for funds advised by a New York-based insurer, resulting in about $700,000 in overcharges.

The U.S. payments giant has a product called Masterpass that allows a user to upload credit card details and acts as an easy way to pay for things online. Recently, the company launched a facility for people to pay with Masterpass for products within Facebook Messenger. A user would interact with a brand by messaging them on Messenger. When they buy a product, Masterpass can be used to pay. It's a trend Mastercard is calling \"conversational commerce\" and it extends to voice too. Ann Cairns, vice chairman at Mastercard, said that buying items using voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant will \"become very big\" in the future. When asked whether Mastercard is looking to integrate Masterpass with these voice assistants, Cairns said, \"Yes, of course.\" \"We're looking at all of these technologies and we're thinking about how they link on the Mastercard network,\" Cairns told CNBC at the Money 20/20 Europe fintech conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Monday. Masterpass can be used to pay for apps on the Google Play store. Mastercards can be used on Amazon and Google already too. Cairns said any integration into voice assistants would be an extension of the relationship between Mastercard and the technology firms. \"We're already integrated into many of Amazon's and Google's products so really it's more of a new product function, product line, that we're looking at. But we're also looking at how is artificial intelligence deployed,\" she said. Mastercard is watching for ways to adapt to the shifts in consumer behavior when it comes to payments. Masterpass was the company's answer to products such as Apple Pay. A number of technology firms are increasingly dipping their toes into financial services and Mastercard is trying to stay ahead through some of these technology products.

Bitcoin prices have struggled this year, along with the cryptocurrency's ability to capture interest on the internet. Searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have dropped more than 75 percent since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months, according to research from Google Trends. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, pegged waning searches as a bad sign for prices. \"We use Google Trends to track search queries for 'bitcoin' as a proxy for potential new buyers,\" Colas said in an email to clients Monday. \"Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.\" Google Trends uses numbers to represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term.

Wallets store the public and private keys which can be used to trade, or receive cryptocurrencies. Growth in new wallets was roughly 2 percent in both April and May, and first-quarter compounded monthly wallet growth was 3.7 percent this year, Colas said. But for the last quarter of 2017 when bitcoin prices were nearing $20,000, wallet growth compounded monthly was 7.6 percent. \"The comparisons between the 2017 back half comps (excellent) and 2018-to-date (poor) are stark and explain essentially all of bitcoin's fall from grace this year,\" Colas said. \"Simply put, history shows bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5%/month to see meaningful price appreciation.\" Bitcoin prices have dropped by roughly 50 percent this year, trading just below $7,500 Monday, according to CoinDesk. The world's first and largest cryptocurrency surged more than 1,300 percent last year, nearing $20,000 in December. \"This dog will have its day, but today isn't it,\" Colas said. \"While we love the idea of bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.\" Google searches for most other top cryptocurrencies has also cratered. For ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, searches are down 70 percent this year. XRP searches have fallen even more sharply, down 87 percent since January 1. Searches for the fourth largest digital currency, bitcoin cash are down 82 percent. But for EOS, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, searches gone in the opposite direction. Google searches for that term have jumped 97 percent this year. Much of that could be due to the company's recent fundraising efforts through what's known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. Start-up Block.one raised more than $4 billion through the cryptocurrency in a yearlong ICO that closed Friday. Unlike an IPO, which gives investors stock ownership in a company, an ICO gives out tokens whose use case is based on a promise the platform will be useful in a digital network once it gets built. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":480,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-tlBwr\"),window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tlBwr\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); ", "author": "Omar Marques | SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/google-searches-for-bitcoin-nosedive-75-percent-this-year.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 75 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the beginning of this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Google Trends", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Nicholas Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "DataTrek Research", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Google Trends", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Google Trends", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "100", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "January 1", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "37", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "9", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"8tiab\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"8tiab\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "roughly 2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "both April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "first-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "monthly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3.7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the last quarter of 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "monthly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "7.6 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "2018-to-date", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "5%/month", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "roughly 50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "7,500", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "more than 1,300 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "its day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Colas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "70 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "XRP", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "87 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "January 1", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "fourth", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "82 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "EOS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "fifth", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "97 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Block.one", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than $4 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "yearlong", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tlBwr\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tlBwr\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px", "category": "CARDINAL"}], "description": "Searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have dropped more than 75 percent since the beginning of this year as interest in the cryptocurrency wanes.

During that time the bank grappled with legal issues, while Staley also found himself the subject of an investigation. \"The last year and a half has had its challenges,\" he said in an interview with Wilf Frost on \"Closing Bell.\" Barclays reduced its head count by 56,000, sold 22 businesses around the world and closed its retail banking business across Africa and continental Europe, Staley said. On the legal front, Barclays was sued by the U.S. Department of Justice over its mortgage-backed securities business in 2006 and 2007 and was slapped with criminal charges by the British government for alleged unlawful financial assistance to Qatari investors. In March, Barclays agreed to pay $2 billion to settle the U.S. suit but denied misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing the instruments and allegations it committed mail fraud and bank fraud. Across the pond, a British court recently dismissed the charges in the 2008 capital-raising case. Meanwhile, Staley was fined 642,430 pounds ($870,428) in May by British regulators for breaching conduct rules by attempting to identify who sent letters criticizing an employee of the bank. The CEO said he felt that investigation was \"fair\" and \"robust\" and pointed out that Barclays is a \"very complicated, challenging bank.\" However, when asked if he ever feared that he may lose his job, he didn't directly respond. \"I feel that it was my obligation to commit my focus and attention to the Barclays shareholders, the Barclays customers and clients,\" he said. However, he believes now it is time for the bank to move forward. \"To a certain extent all of that is behind us and now we can look forward to running the bank and executing on our strategy,\" Staley said, pointing to the bank's \"great\" first quarter. For one, the bank gained \"significant\" market share. Plus, \"our return on equity in the markets business was in double digits in the first quarter,\" he added. \"So, not only did we gain market share, it was quite profitable for us.\" Barclays reported a better-than-expected first-quarter pretax profit of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in April. However, fines and legal costs led to a statutory loss. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

The idea of a united Europe is a centuries-old dream come true. It has survived massive butcheries perpetrated by Charlemagne, Napoleon and Hitler who \u2014 in their own different ways \u2014 thought they could unite and dominate the continent through fire, terror and untold crimes. The British joined the European common market \u2014 a fledgling free-trade area \u2014 in the early 1970s, because that's all they wanted. They voted to leave when, after decades of slippages toward an increasingly federal structure, they realized they did not want to board up the Palace of Westminster in rampant sovereignty transfers to the EU Commission. But London is now fighting to remain part of the EU's genuine free-trade area (i.e., the single market) \u2014 without telling the British people about political implications of an arrangement guaranteeing the free movement of goods, services and factors of production. Italy is a very different case. Rome's EU membership was enthusiastically enshrined in a treaty solemnly celebrated on the Capitoline Hill \u2014 hence the Treaty of Rome \u2014 in March 1957. Ever since, a country that formally reunited itself during a period of nearly 60 years in the 19th century, has been one of the staunchest supporters of the European project. Italians mismanaged their economy That is still the case. Correctly reading the mood of the Italians, the country's President Sergio Mattarella told a few weeks ago the leaders of the Five Star Movement and the League not to come back to him for approval of a government advocating Italy's exit from the EU and the euro area. They did not listen, came up with the wrong people and Mattarella sent them packing. Ultimately, they had to present a new government to pass the president's EU screening test. Mattarella knew that the idea of leaving the EU was one of those Italian political jokes that Germans take seriously. Indeed, anybody who knows anything about Italy also knows that the Italian people, and Italy's political establishment of all stripes, are not against the European Union. No, they are only emphatically against \u2014 what they apparently believe \u2014 is a union run by Germany on German terms. That's an unfortunate \u2014 and fundamentally incorrect \u2014 view of how things really stand, and how they should be. It is a ploy to hide the sad truth that Italian politicians have gravely mismanaged their economy. Germany had relatively little to do with that. Here are a few things to think about. First, Italy's unreformed and unaffordable welfare state has led to calamitous public sector accounts. The country's gross public debt stood at 155 percent of GDP at the end of last year, which compares with the euro area average of 105 percent of GDP. It has a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP \u2014 nearly three times the euro area's average of 0.9 percent. Even with historically low credit costs, Italy's interest charges on public debt now account for 3.6 percent of GDP, the highest in the industrialized world and double the euro area's average of 1.7 percent of GDP. Second, that leaves no space for tax cuts or higher public spending to create a policy mix with easy credit conditions that would support stronger economic growth and employment creation. Italy's government spending of 48.9 percent of GDP still stands above the euro area's average of 47 percent of GDP. Third, to keep its huge public debt on a declining path \u2014 toward the euro area mandated objective of 60 percent of GDP \u2014 Italy must run large and steady surpluses on its primary budget balances (i.e., budget before interest charges on public debt). These surpluses have now come down to 2.2 percent of GDP from an average of 4 percent during the period from 2012 to 2015. Push Germany to change its economic policy Fourth, to argue, as the new government does, that Italy can grow its way out of this fiscal bind is to believe the fairy tales told by five star comedians. Italy must bear down on its budget deficits and keep trimming unaffordable public spending. As a result of that, Rome can only get a sustainable support to growth from easy money and exports. Germans will keep screaming about the negative real short-term interest rates, but the European Central Bank will maintain accommodative policies as long as the euro area's core inflation rate of about 1 percent remains far below the medium-term target of 2 percent. On exports, Italians would have to pick a fight with Germany \u2014 a country that is making a mint off its EU trade partners. As President Donald Trump would say: That should be an easy win. Germany is clearly going overboard on that one. This year, Berlin expects a whopping current account surplus of $340 billion, or 8.3 percent of GDP. That could be an opening salvo in Italy's attempt to chip at German-dominated EU policies. But let's cut Germany some slack. France, Italy and the rest of the euro area don't have to put up with German policies that are robbing them of their growth and employment. They can force Germany to change its ways \u2014 without waiting for Trump to read the riot act to free-trade abusers and inveterate trade surplus artists. Italy also did not have to sign on to euro area rules it could not live by. Decisions are taken in a unanimous vote. Italy should have simply vetoed things it could not do, or taken a British-style opt-out. It is, therefore, disingenuous to blame Germany for Italy's policy mistakes. Investment thoughts There is no constituency strong enough to wreck the EU's epochal project of a continent that is free, peaceful, united and prosperous. Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2014 76 percent of the euro area \u2014 have particular responsibility to run a stable common currency as a pillar of a broader union to generate steady growth, high employment and price stability. For that to happen, Germany must balance its intra-EU trade accounts to allow other countries to grow, create jobs and square their public finances. Germany now generates 65 percent of its trade surpluses on the back of other EU members. That cannot continue and Berlin seems willing to talk about it. But Germany is now a sharply divided country in a sulking mood. The governing coalition is tearing itself up, and, to top it all off, a widely read and respected German news outlet ran this column on Friday: \"Rage against the Germans. Nobody likes us \u2014 just why?\" A good place to start looking for an answer might be a lack of tact, empathy and comity in German dealings with other EU member states. In spite of those difficulties, the European project remains on track. The euro-denominated assets are sound investment choices thanks to the ECB \u2014 arguably the best and the most useful institution the Europeans have created so far.

The Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP basket is up about 4 percent in 2018, while the S&P 500 index has gained just more than 2 percent as of Friday's close. The overall U.S. stock market has struggled to make sharp gains this year as investors grapple with myriad concerns, including rising trade tensions between the U.S. and key partners, fears of rising inflation and geopolitical concerns from overseas. Those worries also have led to increased volatility in the market. \"The S&P 500 index has experienced 34 1%+ moves since the start of 2018, the most during the first five months of any year since 2010,\" David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in a note Friday.

It's time for investors to go long shares of Macy's because classic brands and retailers have finally innovated their way into the digital era, according to Evercore ISI. Analyst Omar Saad, who double-upgraded his rating on shares of the iconic department store to long from short, says Wall Street's fears about a \"retailpocalypse\" stemming from Amazon's ascent are overblown. \"In a nutshell, we are convinced that old-world brands and retailers are figuring out how to manage inventory and market to consumers in the digital era, a critical turning point for the sector,\" Saad said in a note Sunday. \"Macy's and others will have equal opportunity in the coming years to compete for the attention of discretionary consumers given a core set of competitive advantages that are not going away.\" \"Multi-year share price underperformance and still modest valuations despite a very healthy consumer macro environment tell us that the market is still married to the sensational 'retailpocalypse' narrative which assumes that Amazon and other digital disruptors will continue unabated,\" he added. That's \"a viewpoint with which we no longer agree.\" show chapters Brick and mortar retailers are catching up to online retailers: Analyst 9:19 AM ET Thu, 17 May 2018 | 06:15 Access to better brands, low-to-no-cost prime real estate that could serve double duty as local distribution centers for e-commerce order, and a household name franchise all spell upside for the company, Saad added. The analyst raised his 2018 earnings per share estimate to $3.15 from $2.95 and his 2019 estimate to $3.40 from $3.10. Shares of Macy's rose 4.3 percent Monday following Saad's bullish note, adding to a 47 percent climb so far this year. Macy's said it acquired New York-based concept shop Story earlier this month in one of its latest attempts to develop brands that resonate with customers. The add-on has worked with brands like Jet.com and Dressbarn to curate rotating shopping experiences, with themes ranging from \"well being\" to \"made in America.\" The department store also rolled out a pop-up marketplace earlier this year to select locations, designed to bring Macy's closer to young brands looking to grow as well as provide the company with ways to offset unprofitable square footage. These types of initiatives, Saad argued, are key to an ongoing evolution in softline retailers across the country. \"A centralized pool of inventory will enable Macy's to service the same (if not more) demand with less inventory, an incredibly healthy dynamic. In recent years, Macy's has been implementing processes to improve inventory flow and management,\" he wrote. \"These efforts are just starting to pay off, with inventory continuing to decline over the past year while retail gross margins held relatively steady and finally inflected to positive in the first quarter of 2018.\" Disclaimer WATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become show chapters Amazon is so much more than online shopping \u2014 here's how big its become 9:00 AM ET Sat, 14 April 2018 | 03:56 ", "author": "Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/the-retailpocalypse-is-over-and-its-time-to-go-long-macys-evercore-isi-says.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Getty Images Pedestrians", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Herald Square", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Evercore ISI", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Omar Saad", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Saad", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Sunday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the coming years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Multi-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Brick", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "17", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Access", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Saad", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3.15", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2.95", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3.40", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "3.10", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "4.3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Saad", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "47 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Jet.com", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Dressbarn", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "America", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Saad", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "recent years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Macy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the past year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the first quarter of 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Disclaimer WATCH", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "9:00 AM ET Sat", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "14 April 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "03:56", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "Evercore double-upgraded its rating on shares of Macy's to long from short, adding that fears of a \"retailpocalypse\" at the hands of Amazon are overblown.", "title": "The 'retailpocalypse' is over and it's time to go long Macy's, Evercore ISI says", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/22/105223301-GettyImages-530665640.jpg?v=1526988235"}, {"time": "2018-06-04T11:14:37-0400", "body": " S3studio | Getty Images Estonia said Monday it is not planning to launch a national cryptocurrency and that it never planned to do so. A government spokeswoman said the Baltic nation was not looking to issue its own national cryptocurrency as it already uses the euro as its official currency. Instead, Estonia plans to \"explore various possibilities\" for blockchain technology, such as the use of crypto tokens within its \"e-residency\" program, which gives both Estonians and foreigners a digital form of identification. Last year, Kaspar Korjus, managing director at Estonia's e-residency program, announced the proposal for a cryptocurrency called \"estcoin\" that could be issued by Estonia. Korjus said at the time that the estcoin tokens could be launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) \u2014 a form of fundraising for start-ups where new digital tokens are sold to raise money. Estonia joined the euro zone \u2014 a bloc of countries that have adopted the single currency \u2014 in 2010, becoming the first former Soviet nation to do so. Initial reports of Estonia's interest in cryptocurrency sparked a reaction from Europe's central bank chief. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said that \"no (European Union) member state can introduce its own currency.\" Triin Oppi, Estonia's media adviser, disputed a report by Bloomberg that claimed the country had \"scaled down\" plans to launch a cryptocurrency. She said such plans \"never existed.\" Oppi said that the e-residency program had \"initiated a discussion\" into whether Estonia should issue its own cryptocurrency and that the estcoin proposal was still on the table \"within the e-residency community.\" She said that the Estonian government was considering the possibility of providing a legal framework for ICOs, similar to a proposal from Japan. \"We strongly believe in the potential of blockchain technology as a tool for economic development, empowerment and inclusion and we notice that several private and public institutions worldwide are also exploring its opportunities,\" Oppi told CNBC in an email Monday. \"Estonia already has a vital start-up sector and we are looking for various initiatives to make it even stronger.

When it comes to proving the tangible benefits of the blockchain technology that many expect to change the world, it is still very early days and the earliest viable applications will likely be in supply chain management, rather than financial services, executives say. In fact, Cisco stopped researching blockchain applications in financial services after 18 months because it will take a while for the many players in the complex markets to get up to speed, Anoop Nannra, head of the company's blockchain initiative, told CNBC in May. Instead, for the last year or so he said the team has been investigating blockchain applications in supply chain management. Even still, their research indicates it will be roughly 10 years before blockchain really becomes prevalent in supply chain management. For financial services, Nannra predicts somewhere from five to 25 years. \"It's anyone's guess,\" Nannra said. \"When you're trying to drive a mindset shift it's almost a generational thing.\" Expected years for widespread adoption of blockchain Source: Altman Vilandrie; Cowen and Company. Companies and governments across industries are exploring blockchain. Market intelligence firm IDC predicts global spending on blockchain solutions will more than double to $2.1 billion this year, according to a Cowen report on May 24. However, Cowen also said a survey of 23 executives and experts in the field expect on average the technology will take 5.9 years to gain widespread adoption. In theory, blockchain \u2014 often referred to as distributed-ledger technology by corporations \u2014 cuts costs and increases transaction efficiency because the technology eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology, with a focus on payments. Its price, and that of many other cryptocurrencies, skyrocketed last year as investors speculated on the potential for blockchain to change the world as much as the internet did. But by late last year it was becoming apparent to many that blockchain technology isn't necessarily the best solution in many cases. It could add complexity to existing systems. Mark Smith, CEO of blockchain development company Symbiont, said that after four years of research, the firm has found the technology works best when there's an opportunity to automate processes, such as data collection. \"I think supply chain is going to be the first, if not near the first, to really show the value of blockchain,\" Smith said. \"There aren't any regulatory questions in supply chain management that you have to deal with.\" Anatomy of a supply chain Source: Cowen IBM, the most outspoken corporation on blockchain, has announced major projects in applying the technology to global supply chains: \"Big Blue\" partnered with UBS in 2016 to improve trade financing by using blockchain to verify transactions and automatically release payments as a shipment travels from a warehouse to an airplane, truck or boat and arrives at a port. Bank of Montreal, CaixaBank, Commerzbank and Erste have since joined the project, called Batavia. In August 2017, IBM announced Walmart, Tyson Foods, grocery supply chain company McLane, Driscoll's and other major companies in the global food supply chain formed a consortium to develop a blockchain application for the industry. In January, Maersk and IBM announced plans to form a joint venture to improve efficiency in global trade by using blockchain technology to standardize data collection. IBM is in a quiet period about the venture and could not speak directly about it. \"Blockchain's really about trust in data and business processes,\" said Ramesh Gopinath, vice president of blockchain solutions at IBM. \"When you have to rely on data, four or five hops upstream, you have to have a reason to trust it and blockchain provides that.\" He said four key elements for a viable blockchain-based platform are: members, data, applications and the application programming interface for third parties. If trust is blockchain's real value, many enthusiasts say the technology will work best not as a new system within private enterprise, but in its pure form \u2014 an open-source, publicly accessible platform powered by a global network of users. In supply chain management, start-up Eximchain is looking to launch the first public platform for the industry using blockchain. The company plans to keep user transactions encrypted using Quorum, an open-source blockchain program spearheaded by J.P. Morgan. Hope Liu, formerly of UBS, co-launched Eximchain through MIT in 2015 and has raised $20 million for the company. Her immediate goal is to give millions of small and medium-sized enterprises a jump-start at gaining enough credibility through blockchain records to get better financing. Suppliers have the earliest upfront costs, but typically get paid last. Having a record of their contribution to a finished product on a blockchain could help suppliers get loans to fund new orders before getting paid for prior work. \"The longer the supply chain \u2026 the more parts, the more value,\" Liu said. \"We actually turned down some of the customers because their use case doesn't make sense [for blockchain].\" In finance, some companies have found they didn't need blockchain either. \"The return on investment for large-scale DLT solutions in highly efficient, deep and mature markets does not exist today,\" Michael Bodson, CEO of clearing and settlement giant DTCC, said in the company's 2017 annual report. \"New technology isn't always needed to drive innovation. As we demonstrated last September, the move to a T+2 settlement cycle in the U.S. was achieved using current technology,\" Bodson said. DTCC began exploring blockchain more than two years ago. But financial institutions aren't about to abandon their research in blockchain. DTCC is planning to test the technology for managing credit derivatives records. Citi and Goldman Sachs rank among the five corporations exploring and investing the most in blockchain in the six years through the first quarter of 2018, according to CB Insights. Blockchain represents \"a big change, honestly, in the financial system,\" said William D'Angelo, partner at law firm Drinker Biddle in Los Angeles. \"The people that are most worried are the banks. They're spending millions and millions of dollars to build private blockchains so they don't feel like they're shut out.\" In the meantime, far younger blockchain companies are looking for areas in finance in which the technology does make sense. Some start-ups are using the technology for cross-border payments. Five-year-old Symbiont is working with Vanguard to process some index data, and developing a blockchain platform for investment in private equity funds. Many of the blockchain projects have also decided to circumvent traditional funding routes by directly issuing digital tokens through initial coin offerings. The ICOs have raised $9.1 billion so far this year, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. But it remains to be seen whether start-ups or major corporations will be the first to unlock the full value of blockchain. \"We haven't disrupted a single industry yet with blockchain technology yet, but the industries we are disrupting are going to respond,\" said Robert Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a cryptocurrency focused on user privacy.

A New York start-up aiming to make voting easier for regular shareholders who don't know the nitty-gritty details of proxy ballots and shareholder meetings is using the Tesla vote as its debut moment. People who want to voice their opinions for or against an independent chairman at Tesla can sign up for the digital site, called Say. They will be able to connect it to their brokerage account to verify they own Tesla shares, and then click one of two buttons, one for keeping Musk in that role and one against. It is a mobile app and a website. Ultimately, the app is aiming to make it easier for regular investors to take advantage of their ownership rights and make their votes count, Say's co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Cruttenden told CNBC. He got the idea through his other start-up, a micro-investing robo advisor called Acorns. For Tesla's meeting, the Say \"vote\" is really a poll. Actual ballots cast for the Tesla proxy had to come from shareholders of record as of April 12 and voted through a broker. Say is working on connecting to brokers so it can handle shareholder verification and voting at some point in the future. Technology has made trading and investing easy, but the voting part of it for a long time \"has not been exactly customer-friendly,\" Cruttenden said. \"The proxy voting experience was so terrible that we really wanted to make sure that we could improve it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. It's an open question how motivated Tesla's shareholders will be to vote for change. While big fund companies and professional investors have high rates of voting participation, only 27 percent of retail investors vote, according to a report by Broadridge Financial and PwC. And voting tends to go along with management recommendations. Last year, 93 percent of votes were cast in support of director nominees and 84 percent in support of executive pay, the report said. Tesla is nearly half-owned by big fund companies, and Musk holds another nearly 20 percent stake, according to FactSet. Cruttenden said generally, turnout is low for electronic proxy voting, about 5 percent, as well as paper ballots, about 30 percent. And it skews to older, wealthier shareholders. Younger or newer investors don't necessarily know they can vote, he said. Tesla shareholders vote for an independent chairman at the electric automaker's annual meeting Tuesday. Musk has been chairman since 2004 and CEO since 2008. A shareholder proposal pushing the idea of an independent chairman has the support of proxy voting advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, though the company is urging people to vote against it. The shareholder contends that the job has gotten too complex for one person. Musk has been scrambling to get Tesla's Model 3 production on track against scrutiny of the company's manufacturing abilities. He also has a variety of other projects, including space transport, solar power and high-speed tunnel travel. \"The complexity of large-scale manufacturing and the challenges of successfully commercializing new technologies and new manufacturing and marketing techniques suggest that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company, and allowing an independent director to run the board,\" ISS said in a report last month. It is usually difficult for shareholders to win campaigns, though big labor unions representing pensions and faith-based groups have raised issues from corporate governance to environmental and social issues for years with mixed results. Activists led by a religious group recently won a surprise vote at gunmaker Sturm Ruger, requiring it to prepare a report on the risks associated with its business. The shareholder pushing the vote at Tesla isn't a major activist with a big following, either.

The price of the S&P 500 component fell 41.8 percent Monday, down $37.78 from Friday's closing price above $90. Nektar's market cap, which was over $15 billion by Friday's close, was reduced to roughly $9 billion by the end of the session. The drop in stock price was the company's worst one-day fall ever. The precipitous fall came after data released Saturday suggested that patients diagnosed with melanoma aren't reacting to the company's experimental treatment as well as earlier samples did. The prior data, released last year, was in part responsible for the company's rally to all-time highs in the first half of 2018.

J.P. Morgan is selling European stocks and buying American ones in the wake of Italy's political crisis. \"The weaker Euro helps Eurozone, but the global investor flows are likely to stay on the sidelines as Italy will remain an issue in the background, with the new populist government being potentially quite confrontational,\" Europe-based global equity strategist Mislav Matejka and his team said in a Monday report. They reduced their rating on euro zone stocks to neutral, from overweight, in a global regional portfolio, and moved the funds to the U.S., raising their allocation to overweight from neutral. show chapters It's really 'smart' to worry about Europe, says chief strategist. Here's why 8:35 AM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 03:27 On Friday, Italy swore a populist coalition into power, bringing some closure to political turmoil that hit global markets last week. Earlier in the week, the euro dropped to a low of $1.1506, its lowest since July 2017. The STOXX Europe 600 index fell 1.07 percent last week for a second straight week of declines. \"Within Eurozone, Italy was our top pick in '17 and entering '18, but in early May we closed this call, and called to recycle the profits into Germany. We reduce our year end targets for Eurozone by 5%, following the downgrade in GDP forecasts for the year,\" Matejka said. He added that likely delays in monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank also do not help euro zone stocks, which tend to fall into the \"value\" category of stocks that benefit more from higher yields. J.P. Morgan still sees about 12 percent gains ahead this year from Thursday's close for MSCI Eurozone and 8 percent for MSCI Europe. The bank's head of U.S. equity strategy, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, has a year-end price target of 3,000 for the S&P 500, a roughly 11 percent gain from Thursday's close. The forecast is the median of targets in CNBC's Strategist Survey. The \"S&P 500 posted solid gains every time yields rebounded, except during the Fed taper tantrum episode of May '13,\" Matejka said in Tuesday's report. \"The stocks - bonds correlation remains negative, which acts as an automatic valuation cushion in case of equity falls.\" J.P. Morgan expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times this year. Further growth in corporate earnings also should help U.S. stocks, Matejka said. The strategist is also overweight Japan but neutral on emerging markets until a better buying opportunity appears. \"We worry that EM might struggle if the USD firms, if Fed surprises on the upside, if the US political agenda moves strongly anti-trade or if China activity slows,\" he said. \"Also, we believe that Asian Tech might consolidate its dramatic outperformance as it is expensively priced.\" ", "author": "Alessandro Bianchi | Reuters", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/jp-morgan-upgrades-us-stocks-downgrades-europe.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Alessandro Bianchi", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Italy", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Giuseppe", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Chigi", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Rome", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Italy", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "June 1, 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "J.P.

The tally of names disclosed on Tuesday showed the ambition of newly empowered antitrust regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which revealed on Friday it planned to seek charges against the investment banks over a 2015 share-raising for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), plus ANZ itself. The regulator said charges over the share placement have been laid against Citi's former Australia head Stephen Roberts, its current local head of capital markets John McLean and its London-based head of foreign exchange trading Itay Tuchman, along with Deutsche's former local chief Michael Ormaechea and former local capital markets head Michael Richardson. It said charges were also laid against ANZ, its treasurer Rick Moscati, as well as the two investment banks. \"These serious charges are the result of an ACCC investigation that has been running for more than two years,\" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. He declined to comment further since the matter was before the court. ANZ, Citi, and Deutsche have previously said they would defend the charges. After the names of the people being charged were released, Deutsche said it continued to believe it and its staff had acted responsibly, in the interests of clients and legally. \"Both Michael Ormaechea and Michael Richardson are highly regarded and have our full support,\" a spokeswoman said in an email. Citi, which has said the regulator appeared to have criminalized standard practices in capital raisings without warning, and ANZ were not immediately available for comment. The charges come at a difficult time for Australia's financial sector which is facing a year-long public misconduct inquiry that has brought embarrassing headlines on an almost daily basis. Earlier this week, the country's biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), paid a record A$700 million ($535 million) to settle a civil lawsuit in which it was accused of more than 50,000 breaches of anti-money laundering protocols. The charges against ANZ and its investment banks, which can carry hefty fines and 10-year prison terms, could lead to changes in the way institutional capital raisings are handled, and do further damage to the reputation of Australian lenders. The placement was made when Australian banks were under pressure to meet new capital requirements, which prompted ANZ and CBA to raise a combined A$8 billion in a single week. The regulators disclosed the names of the people charged after the close of share trading on Tuesday. ANZ shares closed down 0.3 percent, in line with the broader market, but are down 7 percent since the inquiry started in February. The ACCC has been building a team of investigators since cartel conduct was criminalized in 2009, and was further empowered last year with new laws governing competition. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which brought the charges on behalf of the ACCC, said further details would not be made public until after the first court appearance in Sydney on July 3.

Rather, he suggests, it's the bull market's main event right now. \"There's such focus on large cap, S&P 500 and Dow 30 stocks that often times investors forget about the historical outperformance that could be provided from owning mid-cap and small-cap stocks,\" Stoltzfus said Monday. \"Investors still have good reason to be positive on equities.\" The Russell 2000 index of small caps hit a fresh record high Monday. It's now up nearly 8 percent this year while the Dow, which got hit with two corrections this year, is virtually flat. According to Stoltzfus, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which closed at a record high on Monday and has rallied more than 10 percent this year, also signals the bull market is firmly in place. \"It is right in the trend of where we are experiencing growth \u2014 not only in the U.S. but around the world,\" he added. Stoltzfus acknowledged that geopolitical risks such as U.S.-China trade tensions could continue to bruise the broader markets in the near term.

Chanos, who teaches a course on the history of financial fraud at Yale University, says the mania around cryptocurrency following bitcoin's rise near $20,000 last year fits into what he calls the \"fraud cycle.\" Bitcoin has been compared it to \"digital gold,\" because some see it as a store of value, and it has a limited supply. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told CNBC in an interview this week that he \"totally buys into\" that comparison and the phrase \"pure digital gold.\" Chanos challenged that store-of-value case, saying that in an \"apocalypse\" food would actually function better as a currency. \"In the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,\" Chanos said. \"The last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\" Others see bitcoin as a viable currency, with no lender of last resort or third party adjudicator. While it can be used to transact, it's more appealing to those looking to dodge government oversight, he said. \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions,\" said Chanos, who founded New York-based Kynikos Associates. \"That's one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\" Some fraudsters have been emboldened by the fundraising craze known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The SEC has cracked down on the process with subpoenas and charges against some celebrity-backed projects this year. ICOs raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to the most recent research firm Autonomous Next. \"I suspect going forward we're going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging,\" Chanos said. The short-seller has rallied against bitcoin before, calling it \"speculative mania.\" \"It's Beanie Babies,\" he said at a Schechter event in Detroit, Michigan, referring to the collectible toy craze during the 1990s.

One of the world's largest digital currency exchanges shut down briefly Tuesday morning due to a cyberattack. Bitfinex was targeted in what's known as a DDoS, or a distributed denial-of-service attack, which overwhelms a system with multiple virus-infected servers. \"The previous outage was caused by issues with one of our infrastructure providers,\" the company said on its website. \"While the platform was recovering, the attack caused extreme load on the servers.\" TWEET Bitcoin prices fell 2 percent following the news, hitting a low of $7,373.47, according to data from CoinDesk.

Bitfinex was founded in Hong Kong in 2012 as a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange, and later added support for other cryptocurrencies. Last June, hackers targeted it and other exchanges as bitcoin rallied. Bitfinex also suspended trading in August 2016 after a hack resulted in the theft of nearly 120,000 bitcoins.

In December, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange called Youbit lost 17 percent of its digital assets. Its parent Yapian later filed for bankruptcy. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was the first high-profile hack. It filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and said it lost 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and 100,000 of the exchange's own.

Despite bitcoin's price decline this year, a cryptocurrency \"mining\" company is moving ahead with plans to repurpose a 1,300 acre plot once used by Alcoa for aluminum smelting. Coinmint said Tuesday it would invest up to $700 million in the upstate New York location, which it expects to be the biggest bitcoin mining center in the world. The project will create an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months. After Alcoa shuttered its aluminum smelting operation there four years ago, the company was looking for a tenant. Following some back and forth and a few months of discussions, Coinmint said it signed a 10 year lease with options to renew. show chapters Bitcoin mining firms getting pushback from New York State 2:32 PM ET Fri, 16 March 2018 | 00:39 Since they penned a deal, bitcoin prices have dropped about 30 percent and are down nearly 50 percent this year, according to data from CoinDesk. \"As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,\" said Coinmint's Chief Technology Office Prieur Leary. \"We've developed a process to get an edge in the market.\" Part of that process was the move to Massena New York, just south of the Canadian border. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":506,\"200\":453,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-AZFrh\"),window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"AZFrh\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"AZFrh\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); The town has access to clean and cheaper power alternatives like hydroelectric and wind. Leary pointed out that each computer used to \"mine\" generates 1400 watts \u2014 the same as one hairdryer. With hundreds of thousands of these hot machines operating at once, upstate New York's climate is ideal for reducing air-conditioning costs. Cryptocurrency \"mining\" is essentially math done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what's known as a \"distributed ledger.\" In return for solving equations \"miners\" receive bitcoin. Operations are already underway at the former Alcoa East Facility complex, and are projected to be at full capacity within a year. The 435 Megawatt mining center is expected to be the world's largest digital currency data processor, based on capacity, Coinmint said. Most of Coinmint's competitors are overseas. Bitmain is the leader in the industry, and raked in record profits as bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. The Chinese company likely made as much $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, according to Bernstein analysts estimates.

While U.S.-China trade talks remain unresolved, data shows the U.S. has lost more soybean sales to the Asian country this year than last. \"Soybean exports to China are down significantly from last year and the volume of outstanding sales is relatively low, indicating that there doesn't seem to be a large volume of sales waiting to be exported,\" Veronica Nigh, economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said in an email. Accumulated lost sales of U.S. soybeans to China in the marketing year ending Aug. 31 have grown so quickly that four weeks ago the level already surpassed that of the entire 2016-2017 marketing year, Nigh pointed out. Accumulated lost sales include cancellations, foreign purchases and destination changes. Note: Green bars indicate Trump administration announcements on trade. This past weekend, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross concluded negotiations with China on trade with no specific agreement. A White House statement said the two sides focused generally on supplying U.S. agriculture and energy products to China. Beijing has threatened to retaliate on the Trump administration's proposed tariffs with duties on U.S. goods such as soybeans. China is the second largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports, and about one in three rows of U.S. soybeans go to the Asian giant, according to industry reports. \"At the moment the market environment, the business environment, is one that has extreme uncertainty underpinning it,\" Devry Boughner Vorwerk, corporate vice president, global corporate affairs at Cargill, told CNBC in a phone interview on Monday. \"With all the uncertainty hanging over our head with potential tariffs going into place, the U.S. may lose its position with one of its biggest customers.\" Minnesota-based agriculture giant Cargill has been operating in China for more than 40 years and operates six oilseed crush plants in the country, according to a letter Vorwerk sent the Office of U.S. Trade Representative on May 11. Note: Green bars indicate Trump administration announcements on trade. China canceled 136,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean purchases in the week ended May 24, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agriculture Service. That brings accumulated exports of U.S. soybeans to China for the marketing year to 27 million metric tons, 20.5 percent less than this time last year. Beijing said in a statement this weekend it is willing to increase imports from the U.S., but said any deal is off if the Trump administration goes through with tariffs, according to a report from state-backed newspaper Xinhua. On those conditions, China also offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources. That figure is a fraction of the $375.2 billion U.S. trade deficit with China that President Donald Trump would like to reduce. The trade dispute also involves protection of U.S. intellectual property and picked up in the last several months with the Trump administration's tariffs on steel imports. U.S. soybean futures are down 1.7 percent week-to-date to just above $10 a bushel. They dropped 1.9 percent last week, after rallying 4.3 percent the week prior in the wake of a pause in the trade dispute. To be sure, overall U.S. soybean exports to China were expected to decline in the current marketing year due to a historical low in U.S. soybean protein content, Rich Nelson, director of research at market research and trading firm Allendale, told CNBC last month. The cancellations and declines in Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans in the last several weeks also come during a time when China tends to shift its buying to Brazil due to seasonal factors. \"We believe China would still like to commit to purchasing from the U.S. market,\" Cargill's Vorwerk said.

Broadcom will handle all of Apple's need for a class of chip in its new iPhones, according to J.P. Morgan, spelling revenue of $10 per phone for the chipmaker. The semiconductor company will maintain total share of non-radio frequency chips used in the upcoming generation of Apple's phones, thereby becoming the sole provider of wireless charging, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS capabilities for the new models, according to analyst Harlan Sur. \"We believe Broadcom will maintain 100 percent share (non-radio frequency chipsets) on 2018 iPhone models with its dominant position as the premier connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS) chipset supplier and its close partnership with Apple on analog interface and wireless charging,\" Sur said in a note to clients Tuesday. \"We see 8 percent to 10 percent increase in non-radio frequency dollar content in the 2018 iPhone models \u2013 upgraded wireless charging chip, increased GPS/wireless charging attach rates are the big drivers,\" he added. The lucrative partnership should contribute to top-line growth, Sur added, ultimately driving profitability and free cash flow at the San Jose, California-based chipmaker. Broadcom declined comment for this story. J.P. Morgan expects Broadcom to report adjusted earnings per share of $4.77 on Thursday, when the company reports second-quarter earnings. Though in-line with consensus estimates for the second quarter, J.P. Morgan's third-quarter EPS projection of $4.63 is better than Wall Street expects, according to FactSet estimates. \"The market often forgets about Broadcom's dominance in wireless connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth, GPS), its close relationship with Apple as an ASIC supplier (mixed signal analog and wireless power) and this silicon content will continue to be a part of all of the 2018 iPhone models,\" the analyst added. \"Next year, we anticipate further content gains on the 2019 models as Apple will move to Broadcom's next generation\" of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi combo chips. In addition to the optimistic earnings projection, the analyst reiterated his overweight rating on Broadcom; his $337 price target implies more than 30 percent upside by the end of 2018 from Monday's close. Though the stock rose 0.3 percent Tuesday, Broadcom is underperforming the broader market so far this year, up 0.9 percent versus the S&P 500's 2.9 percent climb.

Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line all dropped more than 4 percent and were the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line had their biggest one-day declines since 2016 while Royal Caribbean posted its worst day since April. Cruise line stocks have been under pressure this year, dropping at least 5 percent. \"We remain relatively cautious on the cruise lines given the high and increasing level of industry supply growth, slowing yield momentum, and weakness in the Caribbean and China,\" Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley wrote in a note Tuesday. \"Globally, the cruise industry orderbook has risen to a record 244k [beds] (45% supply growth to 2025). \u2026So for the industry to maintain, say, 2-3% yield growth, demand would need to grow by 7.5-9.5% annually, which for four consecutive years seems optimistic and is much more than historical levels (6% demand, 1% yield, 5% capacity),\" Rollo said. \"Our channel checks show solid booking volumes but at flat prices, and agents cite concerns about the Caribbean and general Q4 demand,\" the analyst added. The analyst added that a stronger dollar, coupled with rising fuel costs, led him to cut his earnings per share estimates on Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line by 11 percent, 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for fiscal 2019. \u2014 CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report.

It's not clear whether pursuing bilateral trade agreements with the two countries would effectively end the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place for more than two decades. \"Yesterday we met with the president a couple times and he is very seriously contemplating kind of a shift in NAFTA negotiations,\" Kudlow said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"His preference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately.\" show chapters Kudlow: US would welcome talks about unfair trading practices 10:31 AM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 02:56 \"I think the important thought here is he may be moving quickly towards these bilateral discussions instead of as a whole,\" Kudlow said. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso fell on Tuesday vs. the U.S. dollar in the wake of the comments from Kudlow. A Canadian government official pointed out this was not the first time the Trump administration has suggested a bilateral, rather than multilateral, approach. The White House and Mexican government did not immediately respond to CNBC emails for comment. Canada and Mexico are the second and third-largest trading partners of the U.S., respectively. On Friday, Trump said he \"wouldn't mind\" separate negotiations with the two countries. A day earlier, his administration said it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. In reaction, Canada last week proposed tariffs on a range of goods, including ball-point pens, toilet paper and maple sugar. Mexico said Tuesday it will impose tariffs of 15 to 25 percent on U.S. steel products, a 20 percent tariff on U.S. pork legs and shoulders, apples and potatoes and 20 to 25 percent duties on types of cheese and bourbon. \"Canada's a different country than Mexico.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has picked a new leader for its emerging cryptocurrency division. Valerie Szczepanik, who already worked at the SEC, was promoted to a role that didn't exist until this week: Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation. Szczepanik, who joined the agency in 1997, will \"coordinate efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrencies,\" the SEC said in a statement. The new role is emerging at a key time for the SEC. The financial watchdog is balancing on consumer protection and innovation in what has become multi-billion dollar market. Szczepanik was most recently Assistant Director in the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. She is currently head of the SEC's Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group, co-head of its Dark Web Working Group, and a member of its FinTech Working Group. Before the SEC, she served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and clerked for federal judges on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton called Szczepanik \"the right person to coordinate our efforts in this dynamic area that has both promise and risk.\" Szczepanik received a law degree from Georgetown University and a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. The issue of how to classify a cryptocurrency has been a major point for the agency and cryptocurrency exchanges. The SEC's Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities. But companies tied to cryptocurrencies have maintained that some should be fall under a different category because of their utility and stark differences from stocks. The agency has warned investors of pump-and-dump schemes, shut multiple down, and charged some backed by celebrities with fraud. In May, the regulator created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. Bitcoin prices have plummeted this year. The flagship cryptocurrency is down roughly 50 percent in 2018 after climbing more than 1,300 percent last year. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and other pundits have predicted that institutional investors entering the market could boost liquidity and stagnant prices. But that money seems to be waiting for more guidance from regulators. \"At the moment we're in purgatory with regard to regulatory clarity and I think that's going to keep institutions on the sidelines,\" Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" Monday.

The company, which is controlled by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, plans to accelerate the shift within the next few years, the sources said. They said the move was propelled, in part, by growing regulatory pressure on Ant's core financial businesses, including payments, microlending, credit rating and wealth management. Ant Financial was spun off from Alibaba, which went public in 2014, and has played a major role in shaping the financial technology landscape in China. Its Alipay online payment app is one of the biggest players in an increasingly cashless society. But in five years, technology services will make up 65 percent of Ant Financial's revenue, compared with an estimated 34 percent in 2017, according to confidential company projections viewed by Reuters. That would involve helping banks and other institutions with services like online risk management and fraud prevention. Meanwhile, revenue from financial services is projected to shrink to 6 percent from an estimated 11 percent, and the contribution from payments will be reduced to 28 percent from an estimated 54 percent in 2017, the figures show. Overall revenue is projected to grow at 40 percent annually from 2017 to 2021, the figures show. The shift better aligns Ant with the government's strategy for the financial sector while giving it room to grow and innovate, said Zennon Kapron, director at the Shanghai-based fintech consultancy Kapronasia. \"It makes a lot of sense for them to be focusing on the technology side because it plays to their strengths and it also fits within the government's view of the way that the financial industry would develop,\" he said. Ant Financial is preparing for long-awaited initial public offerings \u0393\u00c7\u00f4 expected to be in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2019 and expects to soon close a funding round to raise $10 billion that would give the company a valuation of $150 billion. The sprawling firm has amassed a range of financial licenses and has become a crucial part of China's massive and vulnerable financial system. That has concerned regulators, who want to make sure that the growing size of Ant and other private financial firms do not present systemic problems to the Chinese economy should they fail, the sources said. Ant Financial was singled out by the People's Bank of China as the only online finance firm for a trial programme to test stricter regulations on financial holding conglomerates, two of the sources said. \"As a non-bank, non-state-owned institution in China, it's not allowed to independently grow too big to manage,\" said one of the sources. \"Every aspect of the technology we have developed will one by one be opened up to current and potential partners,\" a spokesman for Ant said. For Ant and its investors, a successful transition is not guaranteed, as the company still has to figure out how to repurpose its advanced technology capabilities - which range from blockchain and artificial intelligence to security and cloud computing \u0393\u00c7\u00f4 for services tailored for customers like banks, the sources said. Away from financial services Ant has been feeling the pressure from regulators on a number of fronts. Under pressure from the central bank, Ant Financial's subsidiary Sesame Credit stopped issuing individual credit ratings, two of the sources with direct knowledge said. From now on, Sesame Credit will only be used for non-financial purposes, like credit checks for bike rentals and visa approvals, they added. Alipay, meanwhile, has been hit by a central bank decision to raise the reserve funds ratio of such third-party payment firms to 50 percent, two of the sources close to Ant's payment unit said. With the expectation that the ratio will be raised to 100 percent eventually, Alipay could face a further squeeze on profits, they added. Ant's micro-lending business has also come under pressure amid tighter regulatory control on key funding sources for the company like asset-backed securitization, leading it to look for loan-issuing partnerships with traditional banks, the other two sources said. One of the sources said the banking regulator keeps tabs on Ant's financial services almost daily at its headquarters in the city of Hangzhou. In recent weeks, Ant has announced agreements with mid-sized national lenders such as Hua Xia Bank Co, China Everbright Bank, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank to provide them with \"technology-driven solutions.\" Ant Financial has also set caps for its 1.69 trillion yuan ($263 billion) money market fund Yu'e Bao, the world's largest, to limit the amount users can invest per day and on some withdrawals. The moves followed a regulatory requirement for Ant Financial to control the size of the fund to reduce concentration and liquidity risks, according to one of the sources.

Tepper, whose hedge fund owns just 1 percent of the drugmaker's shares, is pushing for a management overhaul days after CEO Brent Saunders outlined a plan to sell Allergan's women's health and infectious disease businesses. The plan resulted from a strategic review that also looked at splitting up the company or doing acquisitions. \"It is time for Allergan's management to concentrate on running a world class pharmaceutical and aesthetics business and forego thoughts of, or the exhilaration from, an ambitious acquisition strategy,\" Tepper wrote in a letter to Allergan's board. The letter was also signed by Douglas Silverman of Senator Investment Group. \"We were underwhelmed by the Company's half-hearted attempt to restore strategic momentum,\" the letter said. Allergan shares rose 0.7 percent Tuesday but are down more than 6 percent year to date. In a statement, Allergan said its board and management \"welcome\" input from shareholders and take their views into account, but it didn't address Tepper's demands for management change.

Britain is selling some of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland for about 2.6 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), although it will realize a significant loss as it unwinds its holding and returns the bailed-out lender to private hands. The government said on Monday it would sell about 7.7 percent of RBS, which was rescued in a 45.5 billion pound bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, reducing its overall stake to 62 percent. Britain will make a loss on that investment, since the same number of shares were worth around 2 billion pounds more when the government made its initial and largest capital injection into RBS, at a price of 502 pence. The loss for taxpayers would be even greater when taking into account a break-even price of 625 pence per share estimated by Britain's National Audit Office, which includes the cost of financing. \"There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares,\" said British opposition Labour Party's finance chief John McDonnell, responding to reports on the sale. \"There should be no sales of RBS shares, full-stop. But because of this government's obsession with privatization, the taxpayers who bailed out the bank will now incur an enormous loss,\" he said. For RBS the sale marks the start of the last leg of a decade-long struggle to return to normality. \"Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge,\" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. RBS has reached a series of such milestones since the start of this year, including the resolution of an investigation by U.S. authorities into its sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis. \"As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long-term investment horizon,\" Khalaf said. RBS, whose shares closed at 280 pence on Monday, declined to comment on the sale process, which is being managed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The investment banks have already found buyers for all the shares, according to one of them, filling the order book within half an hour, in an indication of investor interest. The shares will be sold on Monday evening in a process known as an accelerated bookbuild to institutional investors, UK Government Investments, which manages the holding, said. Final pricing of the deal will become clear on Tuesday. The sale resumes a process the government began in 2015 when it sold the first tranche of its RBS shares - 5.4 percent of its stake - for 330 pence per share, at a 1.1 billion pound loss. That prompted criticism from opposition politicians, who accused the government of poor timing. Subsequent sales were put on hold pending the agreement of the multi-billion dollar settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Representatives from Alphabet's Google were also talking to the company about an acquisition in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the deal talks. The talks for GitHub went on for several weeks, according to several other people familiar with the process, but at the end the auction was not close, suggesting Microsoft's bid was high enough to keep Google at bay. GitHub has, in the past, also attracted takeover interest from companies such as Amazon, according to people familiar with the matter. These people declined to be named, as they were not authorized to discuss the deal with press. Microsoft paid 25 times revenue for GitHub, said one person, which calculates to annual revenue of about $300 million for the code-sharing service, according to one of these people involved in the deal. Last August, the company said it had an annualized run rate of $200 million, and in October it said it was on track to book more than $100 million a year from its enterprise products alone. Google and Microsoft declined to comment on the acquisition process. Microsoft has seen its once-dominant Windows unit slip in market share in recent years, spurring a cloud-first reorganization and sending Microsoft looking for alternatives to court developers. Owning GitHub and LinkedIn also means that Microsoft now owns two top professional networks -- important in the continuing war for scarce tech talent. While Google is making progress in its cloud efforts, the company has so far not made any big acquisitions in the cloud space under leader Diane Greene, who also sits on Alphabet's board of directors. This contrasts sharply with Microsoft's big acquisitions of GitHub and LinkedIn, which cost $26 billion. Cloud applications company Salesforce has also grown in part through significant acquisitions, most recently paying $6.5 billion to buy Mulesoft, whose technology helps software developers stitch disparate applications together. Why Microsoft? GitHub founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath has limited his efforts to make money from the service out of a desire to give free tools to developers, but was drawn to Microsoft because of his relationship with CEO Satya Nadella, one person said. Since taking over Microsoft four years ago, Nadella has embraced open-source software and programmer tools to restore growth and attract third-party developers. show chapters Microsoft CEO on GitHub acquisition 11:36 AM ET Mon, 4 June 2018 | 08:26 GitHub has been an acquisition target for years, and repeatedly spurned requests from companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, according to people familiar with the matter. Atlassian, which has headquarters in Australia and the U.S., and China's Tencent are among other companies that made inquiries in recent years, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential. Amazon and Atlassian declined comment. Tencent didn't respond to requests for comment. \"There has been interest in GitHub for a long time,\" said Peter Levine, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which first backed GitHub in 2012. \"They had lots of options. There's a real strategic fit at Microsoft.\" Levine would not name specific companies who had approached GitHub. Andreessen invested $100 million into GitHub in 2012, the \"largest single check we had ever written,\" Levine wrote in a blog post on Monday. A follow-on funding round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital, valued GitHub at $2 billion. Nadella won over Wanstrath in the last 24 months with his vision for GitHub fitting within Microsoft, one person close to the deal said. New CEO Nat Friedman, who joined Microsoft through a prior acquisition, plans to run GitHub independently for the time being. That is similar to how Microsoft kept LinkedIn largely independent -- although GitHub will eventually become a part of Microsoft's growing commercial cloud business alongside products like Office 365 and Dynamics 365, Friedman told CNBC in an interview. If anything, Microsoft wants GitHub to get even better at being GitHub, Friedman said. GitHub has had ongoing conversations with Microsoft for several years, so the acquisition didn't begin with any single event, Wanstrath told CNBC. The companies have a shared mission to help developers be more efficient and more collaborative, he said. Neither Friedman nor Wanstrath would comment on the acquisition process.

Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pedestrian walks past a Wells Fargo bank branch in Washington, D.C. Wells Fargo continues to slim down its national branch network even as rival J. P. Morgan Chase is set on a big expansion. Earlier Tuesday, Wells said it struck an agreement with Flagstar Bank to sell 52 branches in the upper Midwest, including $2.3 billion in deposits. About 490 employees will also get job offers from Flagstar, which is based in Troy, Michigan. It is part of a larger cull Wells Fargo announced in January, when it said it would cut more than 800 locations by 2020 to get its network down to 5,000. Last year, it closed 214 branches. Wells executives have cited consumer preference for online and mobile banking as the reason to close or sell branches, but litigation costs have also risen related to investigations into sales practices in several business units.

Morgan's top quantitative strategist. \"By attributing the trade-related news flow (positive or negative) to the performance of the U.S. market, we estimated the impact on U.S. equities to be negative 4.5 percent\" since March, J.P. Morgan's Marko Kolanovic said in a note Wednesday. \"Taking the current market capitalization, this translates into $1.25 trillion of value destruction for U.S. companies. For a comparison, this is about two-thirds of the value of total fiscal stimulus.\" Trump has for months used his pulpit and economic tariffs to try to effect change in trade deals the administration deems unfair and ultimately harmful to American economic interests. show chapters Leon Cooperman: I'm not a 'fan' of what Trump is doing on trade 11:15 AM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 | 02:07 Trade continues to be a tense topic between the U.S. and its key partners as well as for investors on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points Thursday following the president's decision to include Canada, Mexico and the European Union in global steel and aluminum levies. Since then, the countries have responded in kind, suggesting tariffs of their own against American exports such as pork, peanut butter and motorcycles. tweet Trump, who's repeatedly highlighted gains in the stock market under his tenure, could actually spur equities higher if he stemmed his tough talk, the J.P. Morgan team said. tweet Kolanovic, who heads J.P. Morgan's global quantitative and derivatives strategy, predicted the stock market correction earlier this year and highlighted complacency and high leverage in the market as warning signs. But in his Wednesday note, the strategist highlighted the impact of trade and protectionist ideology as \"significant\" market headwinds. \"A negotiation strategy that includes bluffing/threats can be successful in a two-party negotiation setup, but is more likely to deliver self-defeating results in a complex system such as global trade,\" he said. \"The value destroyed by a trade war might be reversible if policies are reversed, while the positive impact of fiscal measures is likely to remain. This would likely catalyze a rough 4 percent market rally.\" \"However, if this uncertainty hangs over the market for a more extended period of time, the damage becomes more permanent and the probability of a disruptive tail event increases,\" he concluded. \"Trade tensions continue to inflict damage to investor psychology and business confidence.\" To be sure, Trump's battle for more balanced trade could end up helping the economy. The trade deficit appears to be on the decline, falling to a seven-month low in April, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. The trade gap dropped 2.1 percent to $46.2 billion, the smallest since September. If the trend continues, trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the second quarter, buoyed by strength in the manufacturing sector and consumer spending.

The agency is not adjusting rules for the fundraising process known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs, either, he said. ICOs have raised $9.1 billion this year alone, according to the latest research from Autonomous Next. \"If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,\" Clayton said, \"If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us.\" The SEC is \"happy to help you do that public offering\" if issuers take the responsibility SEC laws require, he said. The chairman also addressed a growing debate over which cryptocurrencies should fall under SEC jurisdiction. \"Cryptocurrencies: These are replacements for sovereign currencies, replace the dollar, the euro, the yen with bitcoin,\" Clayton said. \"That type of currency is not a security.\" A token, or a digital asset used in a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, are securities by Clayton's definition. \"A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say 'you can get a return' that is a security and we regulate that,\" Clayton said. \"We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.\" Whether an asset is a security right now follows the \"Howey Test.\" The ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts. Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities, and reiterated that Wednesday saying \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" But companies tied to those cryptocurrencies have argued that some should fall under a different category, in many cases because of their utility. The financial watchdog has been balancing consumer protection and innovation in what has become multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency market. The market capitalization of bitcoin alone is more than $130 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the SEC picked a new leader for its emerging cryptocurrency division. Valerie Szczepanik, who already worked at the agency, was promoted to a role that didn't exist until this week: Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation. Bitcoin began its price descent in March, falling below $10,000 after the agency said it would require digital asset exchanges to register with the agency. Prices have struggled to recover since. Bitcoin is down roughly 50 percent in 2018 after climbing more than 1,300 percent last year, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency was trading near $7,628 as of 5 p.m ET Wednesday. Bitcoin's three-month performance Source: CoinDesk In late April, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson told CNBC the agency was not looking to ban the fundraising process known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs, and remains open to a legal avenue for crypto investments. One month later, the SEC created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. The agency has cracked down on ICOs year: It has continuously warned of pump-and-dump schemes, issued subpoenas and charged multiple coin projects with fraud. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee and other bitcoin pundits have predicted that institutional investors need more guidance from regulators like the SEC until they fully buy into crypto. Lee told CNBC this week that investors are in \"purgatory with regard to regulatory clarity.\" ", "author": "Zach Gibson | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/sec-chairman-clayton-says-agency-wont-change-definition-of-a-security.html", "keywords": [{"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "3:32 PM ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "6", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "04:27", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "the Securities and Exchange Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jay Clayton", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$19 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$9.1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "this year alone", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Autonomous Next", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Howey Test", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "1946", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S. Supreme Court", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Clayton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "multibillion-dollar", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "more than $130 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Valerie Szczepanik", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Division of Corporation Finance", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Digital Assets", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Innovation", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "below $10,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "roughly 50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 1,300 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "7,628", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "5 p.m ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "three-month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "late April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Robert Jackson", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "One month later", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "HoweyCoins.com", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ICOs year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tom Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission made it clear Wednesday that the agency won't bend the rules for cryptocurrency when it comes to defining what is or what isn't a security.

Financial technology firm Revolut now has 2 million users signed up to its platform and is planning to launch a commission-free trading service. The London-based start-up said Thursday that its trading platform, called \"Wealth,\" would let users invest in a range of firms listed publicly in the U.K. and the U.S., in addition to other instruments including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and options. ETFs are securities that let traders invest in a basket of assets such as shares or bonds. Options are contracts that give investors the right \u2014 but not the obligation \u2014 to buy or sell an asset at an agreed price and date, allowing for price speculation or risk reduction. Revolut doubled its user count just months after it said it had passed the 1 million user mark in November 2017. Its planned commission-free trading service would compete with the likes of the U.K.'s Trading212 and U.S. firm Robinhood. \"For many years, people have felt frozen out of trading by high fees and clunky interfaces, so Revolut are aiming to make investments cheap, simple and completely mobile,\" Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's co-founder and chief executive, told CNBC. The company has widened its product offering into new areas such as cryptocurrency and savings as of late. It started out predominantly as a money management app offering currency exchange at the live currency conversion rate and has since signaled further expansion into banking by offering current accounts and last year applied for a European banking license. \"While the cryptocurrency feature has definitely played a part in our growth, our financial marketplace of products have also helped hugely in enticing people to join Revolut,\" Storonsky said. Revolut's marketplace gives users access to insurance and credit products from a variety of providers, similar to a feature offered by rival fintech firm Starling. It is currently only available in Europe, and is most widely used in the U.K. The firm is looking to expand its presence to the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand within months. Revolut Revolut's commission-free trading platform \"Wealth.\" Revolut said it expects to launch the trading platform next year and is in the preliminary stages of building it. The service will be available to all of its customers, including those in the new markets it plans to expand to. The firm counts itself among several of Europe's so-called challenger banks \u2014 predominantly digital banks looking to compete with larger lenders. German challenger bank N26 recently announced it has 1 million users signed up to its platform. Revolut generates $2 billion a month in transaction volume, while N26 has a monthly transaction volume of $1.17 billion. Storonsky said Revolut was not concerned by such fintech competitors because it expects its main competition to come from tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. \"They have huge amounts of customer data, capital and employees that can help them to easily begin breaking into the banking space,\" he said. Revolut recently joined the ranks of Europe's unicorns by surpassing $1 billion in market value after a $250 million investment led by venture capital firm DST Global.

Money management firm VanEck is trying again for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. On this third attempt, the company is teaming up with blockchain company SolidX and basing the fund on actual bitcoins rather than futures. Each share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The high price reflects the fund's focus on institutional, rather than retail, investors, SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy said in a phone interview with CNBC. If all regulatory filings go through according to plan, the ETF should launch by sometime in the first quarter of 2019, Gallancy said. The fund will track a bitcoin index from VanEck's subsidiary MVIS that uses prices from over-the-counter trades rather than electronic cryptocurrency exchanges. It's not clear whether the structure of the ETF or bitcoin's relative stability recently will help the fund gain approval. Several companies, including VanEck, have tried unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States. show chapters SEC chairman: Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not securities 3:32 PM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 | 04:27 VanEck first filed for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August, but withdrew the application in September at the request of SEC staff since the futures didn't exist yet. The company and several other firms filed again when bitcoin futures launched on CME and Cboe in December. But they had to withdraw those applications in January at the request of SEC staff. In a letter that month, the commission raised concerns such as extreme price volatility and the ability for customers to withdraw funds easily. The SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Bitcoin traded near $7,500 on Wednesday, holding within the trading range of the last few months. SolidX has also struggled to launch a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company's application for an exchange-traded product based on physical bitcoins. Around the same time, the commission also rejected, then said it would review, the Winklevoss twins' proposal for a similar bitcoin fund. VanEck will help market the new bitcoin ETF, SolidX will sponsor or create the underlying index and Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian, the filing said. If approved, the ETF is slated to trade under the symbol XBTC on Cboe BZX Exchange. \"I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios,\" Jan van Eck, chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement. \"A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin,\" he said.

Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable, said the group of CEOs has thrown its support behind companies backing away from the practice. Executives often feel pressure to make quarterly forecasts, but \"it can often put a company in a position where management from the CEO down feels obligated to deliver earnings and therefore may do things that they wouldn't otherwise have done,\" Dimon said in a rare joint interview with Buffett airing Thursday on CNBC's Squawk Box. \"Quarterly earnings: they're a function of the weather, commodity prices, volumes, competitor pricing. And you don't really control that as CEO,\" he added. \"Sometimes you're just like the cork in the ocean, but do the right thing anyway and you're going to be fine in the long run.\" \"You should build the systems you need, you should do the R&D that you need and explain it to your shareholders and your board. Of course, some of the CEOs will say it's the sell side, that we put pressure, but what I'm trying to say to people: be free to drop it.\" Dimon, the chairman and CEO of J. P. Morgan Chase, and Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote about the group's endorsement in an opinion column in The Wall Street Journal. It is a long-simmering debate but one that has gotten more attention in an era when activist investors are more vocal about pushing companies to deliver on their promises. Companies forecast sales and profit numbers to Wall Street analysts, who use it to produce research and stock recommendations for investors. Missing \"the number\" can often result in big, short-term stock moves. Making a forecast, and then hitting the target, are seen as a way to manage expectations and eliminate volatility. Mark Urban | CNBC Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway doesn't give guidance, which Buffett has said can tempt executives to manipulate numbers to meet Street expectations. It's \"sending the wrong message,\" Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick in the interview. \"When companies get where they're sort of living by so-called making the numbers, they do a lot of things that really are counter to the long-term interests of the business.\" Buffett and Dimon helped produce a set of voluntary governance guidelines two years ago, which was signed by more than one dozen executives. One of the principles outlined in that report said companies shouldn't feel obligated to give quarterly guidance, which for years many have blamed for making executives obsessed with short-term results. Those in favor of guidance say it improves communications with Wall Street, reduces share price volatility and boosts a stock's value. But McKinsey & Co. found in a 2006 study that quarterly guidance didn't affect valuation multiples and didn't reduce share price volatility. The only significant benefit it observed was an increase in trading volumes, which is good for day traders but not useful for most other people. David A. Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Instead, McKinsey found, the practice of giving quarterly guidance took up valuable time from management and made them focus too much on the short term. Around that time, big companies like Coca Cola, UPS and AT&T said they would no longer give quarterly guidance. Dimon said Thursday that about 20 percent of Business Roundtable members still do quarterly guidance and about 60 percent provide annual targets. But, he added, taking a stand on the issue is \"a first step.\" ", "author": "Mark Urban | CNBC", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/warren-buffett-and-jamie-dimon-join-forces-to-convince-ceos-to-end-quarterly-profit-forecasts.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Buffett", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Dimon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "7:09 AM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "7 June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "07:09 Warren Buffett", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Jamie Dimon", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the end to quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dimon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Business Roundtable", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dimon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Buffett", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Squawk Box", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dimon", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "J.

Tesla stock closed Wednesday up 9.7 percent at $319.50 per share, meaning investors who sold the stock short lost a collective $1.07 billion in a single day, estimates S3. Tesla bears have lost nearly $5 billion in mark-to-market losses since 2016, S3's head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told CNBC. Tesla shorts mark-to-market losses, in millions Source: Ihor Dusaniwsky, Head of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners Chairman and CEO Elon Musk got a vote of confidence from shareholders at the company's annual meeting Tuesday. Musk also told shareholders it is \"extremely likely\" Tesla will hit a weekly Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars by the end of the month. Tesla has been struggling with production issues and faces concerns about its finances. Tesla is the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., as well as the most heavily shorted automaker in the world. Short interest, or the number of shares borrowed in hopes of buying them back at a profit after the stock drops, totals $9.03 billion for Tesla, according to S3. That's about $1.6 billion larger than second-place Amazon's short interest. Source: Ihor Dusaniwsky, Head of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners \"Shorts are actually covering slightly since the beginning of last month,\" Dusaniwsky said. Shorting Tesla is costing investors \"over $1 million in financing a day to keep up,\" Dusaniwsky added, as the fee investors pay to bet against the stock is at about 3.5 percent. At the beginning of this year, that fee was only about 1 percent, according to Dusaniwsky. By April the short fee had jumped, hitting 3 percent and higher, he said. \u2014 CNBC's Tom Franck contributed to this report.

President Ronald Reagan's Office of Management and Budget director blames a bull market that's getting longer in the tooth \u2014 paired with headwinds ranging from President Donald Trump's leadership to fiscal policy decisions to questionable earnings. \"I call this a daredevil market. It's all risk and very little reward in the path ahead,\" Stockman said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"This market is just way, way over-priced for reality.\" His thoughts came as the Nasdaq was reaching all-time highs again, while S&P 500 rose slightly but the Dow failed to extend its win streak to three days in a row. \"The S&P 500 could easily drop to 1,600 because earnings could drop to $75 a share the next time we have a recession,\" Stockman warned. \"We're about eight or nine years into this expansion. Everything is crazily priced. I mean the S&P 500 at 24 times at the end, tippy top of a business cycle.\" One of his biggest gripes with the bulls is the notion that President Donald Trump's tax cuts are providing a fundamental lift to stocks. \"These tax cuts are going to add to the deficit in the 10th year of an expansion. It's just irresponsible crazy,\" he said. \"It's all going to stock buybacks and M&A deals anyway. That doesn't cause the economy to grow. It's just a short-term boost to the stock market that doesn't last.\" Stockman has made similar bearish calls in the past, but they haven't materialized. Yet, he's not backing down. \"There are some huge surprises lurking out there because we've had eight years of monetary expansion that is just off the charts of history,\" he said. When pressed for when a massive sell-off could hit stocks, he didn't give a time frame. \"When the catalyst finally comes, it's hard to say,\" Stockman said. \"No one can ever define what the black swan is because that is why it's called a black swan.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Ukraine has mired itself in political drama ahead of a crucial vote, the result of which will determine Kiev's access to a financial lifeline. Lawmakers in the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, will vote Thursday on the creation of an anti-corruption court, a key condition of unlocking the country's $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout that's been frozen since last year. Delivery of the funds has been repeatedly put on hold as Kiev struggles to enact the IMF's required reforms, which include the anti-corruption measures and raising household gas prices. A failure to get enough votes for the anti-corruption court \u2014 something Ukrainian politicians have been fighting about publicly, and more fiercely behind closed doors \u2014 could tip the nation into deeper uncertainty and send investors running for the door. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman has threatened to resign if the vote is not passed and all IMF conditions are not met, although he has opposed the hike on gas prices. Ukraine's central bank has highlighted IMF financing delays as \"the key\" risk to its financial stability. The eastern European nation of 45 million has a national interest rate of 17 percent \u2014 the highest in Europe \u2014 and rates are only set to be pushed higher if help from the IMF does not materialize. Inflation, too, remains stubbornly high at 13.1 percent. Four years after mass protests erupted to remove then-President Viktor Yanukovych from power, Ukrainians citizens and international investors are frustrated at an economy that's remained troubled and steeped in corruption. Transparency International ranked Ukraine 130 out of 180 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2017. Genya Savilov | AFP | Getty Images Speaker of Ukrainian Parliament Volodymyr Groysman (R) has been nominated by President Petro Poroshenko's party to head the future cabinet. Ukraine restructured its debt in 2015 following its sovereign debt crisis triggered by conflict with Russia in 2014, leaving it with large annual payments to make between 2019 and 2027. Its foreign currency reserves are at roughly half the level they were before the crisis. Political infighting Meanwhile, Groysman and his finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk have been in an open spat over the naming of appointees, with the latter having sent a letter to his G7 counterparts complaining that nepotism and political corruption continue to dominate Ukraine. On Wednesday, Groysman asked the Rada to fire Danylyuk \u2014 who's been seen as a major reformer \u2014 for misconduct. \"I am sure that lawmakers would be delighted to vote the reform-minded Danylyuk out of office,\" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management. Ukraine managed to successfully sell $3 billion in dollar bonds in 2017, helping mitigate a bit of its debt burden, but the recent sell-off in emerging markets is making borrowing costs far more expensive. The Institute for International Finance recently named Ukraine among the five most vulnerable emerging markets to a strengthening dollar and rate rises. It currently has more than $20 billion in outstanding dollar debt. \"Should the vote fail, it will likely exclude additional IMF support for the foreseeable future while also drawing further negative attention to the government,\" said Maximilian Hess, a senior political risk analyst at London-based consultancy AKE Group. This combined with the Danylyuk-Groysman feud, and a potential stricture on Ukraine's ability to sell Eurobonds the way it did last year, could cripple the country's ability to tap the private debt market for its financing needs, Hess said. Andrew Burton | Getty Images Ukraine's economy has been in turmoil ever since the Euromaidan protests in 2014 that triggered Russian annexation of its Crimean peninsula and a war with Russian-backed forces in the country's east that has engulfed 7 percent of its territory and killed more than 11,000 people. \"While Ukraine maybe \u2014 emphasis on maybe \u2014 could meet its debt obligations in 2019-20, a new sovereign debt crisis is entirely possible, particularly if additional IMF support is not forthcoming,\" Hess said. \"Rising interest rates, the continued conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and uncertainty around the elections and about further loans or guarantees from the EU and other Western partners mean that concerns over the sustainability of Ukraine's state debts could return rapidly.\" ", "author": "Viktor Drachev | AFP | Getty Images ", "link":

Getty Images Paul Jacobs, executive chairman of Qualcomm Inc. Former Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs is starting a new company with two ex-Qualcomm executives that will focus on next-generation wireless technology. The start-up engineering company, called XCOM, will invest and develop technologies to tackle important 5G problems, such as low latency and greater reliability. Jacobs is the new company's CEO and chairman and is joined by Derek Aberle, Qualcomm's former president who left the company last year, and Matthew Grob, who served as Qualcomm's chief technology officer from 2011 to 2017. The new company doesn't interrupt Jacobs' plans to take Qualcomm private. Jacobs is working with Aberle to raise billions of dollars for a theoretical Qualcomm acquisition. Those efforts, while ongoing, have temporarily slowed as Qualcomm waits to see if it will get Chinese approval to acquire NXP. \"It's unclear where the take private plan will go or how long that will take,\" said Aberle in an interview. \"But this is not an either/or. We are pursuing this new company and we have high expectations and confidence in the take-private plan.\" Aberle said he didn't have anything to report on money raised to take Qualcomm private. show chapters Jacobs may step down from Qualcomm board, says Dow Jones 11:21 AM ET Fri, 16 March 2018 | 00:50 Jacobs, Aberle and Grob plan on hiring more people for XCOM in the coming months, said Aberle. They are toying with ideas to license proprietary 5G technology or provide software and designs to other companies to use in their semiconductors, he said. The company is still in such early stages that the executives don't yet have a fleshed out business model, he said. \"There's still a fair amount of work that needs to be done to prove out the applicability of 5G through various Internet of Things applications,\" Aberle said. \"We feel we have some better ideas for how to do some of that stuff.\" If the take-private does happen, the company's technology could be used in Qualcomm chips or the entity could be rolled into Qualcomm, Aberle said. Jacobs' father, Irwin, was a co-founder of Qualcomm, and Paul Jacobs rose through the ranks to become CEO from 2005 through 2014. Qualcomm's board removed him in March as chairman after Jacobs informed them of his desire to take the company private, after Broadcom's unsolicited acquisition attempt was thwarted by the U.S. government.

The New York Stock Exchange finds itself at odds with major pensions and some of the world's biggest asset managers in a fight to preserve a big way exchanges attract business. At issue is the Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to run a pilot test of how the stock market is affected by the transaction fees and rebates that exchanges use to attract trade orders from brokers. The thinking is these fees and rebates, now common across the U.S. stock market, actually distort how stock trades are handled, costing investors money. The SEC plans to see how lowering the fees and rebates for trading in some stocks changes things. Just how much money is at risk is difficult to say. If it's true that investors are getting a worse price for their trades with the rebates in place, it would amount to fractions of a penny, perhaps. But over a long period of time and a big number of trades, those pennies add up. 'You need to care about the pennies' It's the type of inside Wall Street squabble that mom-and-pop investors would normally ignore, if they knew about it at all. But maybe they should pay attention, says Linda Giordano, the co-founder and CEO of BabelFish Analytics, a company that advises mutual funds about their trading. \"You need to care about the pennies.\" The SEC's test has been a long time in the making, and the exchanges are fighting back at what they see as an attempt to undermine a big business. Exchanges make money off the trading data they sell to brokers in addition to the technology services they offer to facilitate speedy trading. The more trading volume they attract, the better. Long-term investors have to compete in this environment with short-term traders looking to make a profit off tiny price moves multiple times a day. Critics say the transaction fees and rebates only motivate brokers to send their trades to the place that will give them the biggest rebate or the lowest fee, not where they could get the best price for customers. Giordano from BabelFish said their observation was that two-thirds of passive routes to an exchange on behalf of investors are made with the rebate in mind. And ClearPool, which designs computer trading models, found that orders placed to get the rebate were seven times more expensive to investors than those placed with a neutral attitude toward the rebate. Pensions in the fight Major pensions such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan have come out in support of the SEC's pilot test, as have giant asset managers such as Vanguard and BlackRock. The agency took in public comments in the last few months before the test is set to begin. \"The model creates the appearance of a conflict between broker-dealers and their customers, as firms may appear motivated to route an order to a specific exchange to realize a higher rebate or a lower fee,\" Vanguard's Joseph Brennan, the global head of equity investment group, wrote in a comment letter. But the NYSE, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, has come out swinging, arguing that the SEC's test itself will be too disruptive and potentially cost investors more than $1 billion. High-frequency trading firms and The Security Traders Association of New York have weighed in with the same concerns, urging the SEC to scale down the test, including eliminating exchange-traded products. The STANY wrote in a recent comment letter, \"[T]he Pilot will likely cause serious disruptions to the market, have significant implications for investors and impose industry-wide costs that have not been justified.\" What's more, the NYSE contends, companies listing their stock on exchanges would also be harmed by the test, which is set up so that 3,000 stocks will be sorted evenly into one of three categories, each with a different set of fees or rebates, to see how different transaction pricing affects them. NYSE letter The NYSE sent a notice to companies urging them to send a comment letter to the SEC about the test. \"The pilot may also disadvantage companies selected for one of the test groups while their peers or competitors could escape that fate,\" said the notice, which was reviewed by CNBC. \"As currently envisioned, it does not appear that companies could opt-out.\" That is exactly something the pensions have asked the SEC to preserve in the test. \"In order to maintain the integrity of the pilot, companies should not have the option to opt out,\" Kevin Duggan of the Ontario Teachers pension and Don Pontes of CalPERS wrote in their comment letter. The broader issue is whether investors are getting a fair shake in the markets, which have become dominated by computerized trades zinging in and out of positions in milliseconds, not to mention a dizzying array of index-tracking funds. That won't be answered by the SEC's test, which is just looking at gathering enough data over a proposed two-year period to decide which way to proceed. \"Rather than rule-making by a hunch, we can actually figure out whether it's right,\" said Georgetown University finance professor James Angel. \"That's why we need a pilot.\" ", "author": "Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/nyse-comes-out-swinging-in-sec-pricing-test-pitting-itself-against-major-pensions-and-fund-managers.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Michael Nagle", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Pedestrians", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the New York Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The New York Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Securities and Exchange Commission's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "a penny", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "a long period of", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Linda Giordano", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "BabelFish Analytics", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BabelFish", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two-thirds", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "ClearPool", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "seven", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Vanguard", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BlackRock", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the last few months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Vanguard", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Joseph Brennan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "NYSE", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Intercontinental Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than $1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "The Security Traders Association", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "NYSE", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "3,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "NYSE", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "NYSE", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kevin Duggan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Don Pontes", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Georgetown University", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "James Angel", "category": "PERSON"}], "description": "The New York Stock Exchange finds itself at odds with major pensions and some of the world's biggest asset managers.", "title": "NYSE comes out swinging in SEC pricing test, pitting itself against major pensions and fund managers", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/25/105158304-GettyImages-950331620.jpg?v=1524664983"}, {"time": "2018-06-08T07:46:51-0400", "body": " Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images Britain's markets watchdog will press ahead with a new premium listing next month aimed at attracting companies like state-controlled Saudi Aramco to London, although the rules have been \"refined\" following investor criticism. The Financial Conduct Authority's initial proposal last year led to suggestions the British government had influenced the watchdog to try to secure the Saudi energy company's planned initial public offering (IPO). Saudi Arabia is expected to float up to 5 percent of Aramco in Riyadh and an international venue such as London or New York in what is expected to be the biggest ever IPO and would boost the reputation of its chosen listing venue. Britain is keen to promote London's leading position as a financial center as it leaves the European Union but some lawmakers had questioned if the original proposal for listings by sovereign-controlled firms could weaken investor protection. The FCA said it was pressing ahead, despite criticism of its plans by major institutional investors when they were first circulated in July last year. \"The FCA thinks there is considerable benefit to investors if corporate issuers agree to meet these additional premium requirements,\" the watchdog said in a statement accompanying an 83-page document outlining the new rules on Friday. The FCA said it had made some changes following feedback, including the requirement that the election of independent directors be subject to approval from independent shareholders. There would also be a requirement for \"timely disclosures\" on transactions between the sovereign and the issuer. But there will not be a requirement for a controlling shareholder agreement, and no need for an advance sponsor opinion or advance approval by independent shareholders of certain transactions with the sovereign or its associates. \"These rules mean when a sovereign controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing,\" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said. Polarized response The watchdog said responses to its consultation were \"polarized\", with big investors mostly against, and all others generally supportive. The Investment Association, which represents big shareholders, said it was disappointed by the lack of a requirement for independent votes on the changes made. It also wants a review of the new listing category after two years to check for any unintended consequences. \"We continue to oppose the inclusion of companies in this new segment in all major equity indices as this would force UK savers to invest in these companies despite the loss of valuable and hard won investor protections,\" the IA's chief executive Chris Cummings said in a statement. Nick O'Donnell, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said that overall the FCA had stuck to its guns while central planks of corporate governance standards, such as being part of a FTSE index not being automatic, remain intact. \"Although the proposal has often been linked with the possible Saudi Aramco IPO, the reality is this is much wider than that. There are a lot of other companies that have been looking at this segment,\" O'Donnell said. A premium listing in London would typically require a float of at least 25 percent of a company's shares, but the new category could allow a smaller float, the FCA said. \"Some very large companies can make a credible case for a liquid market at a free float of less than 25 percent,\" it said.

The San Francisco-based firm is best known for its popular trading platform, which offers four cryptocurrencies. The Keystone acquisition could help Coinbase expand its offerings, and eventually allow them expand into other non-crypto financial products. show chapters Coinbase launches new products for retail & institutional crypto investors 6:41 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 09:30 The deal terms were not disclosed. \" Ultimately, we can envision a world where we may even work with regulators to tokenize existing types of securities, bringing to this space the benefits of cryptocurrency-based markets \u2014 like 24/7 trading, real-time settlement, and chain-of-title,\" Hirji said. Coinbase, which has traded $150 billion in assets across more than 20 million customers, has been plowing money back into areas other than its flagship exchange. In April, the company bought Earn.com for a reported $100 million, which lets users send and receive digital currency for replying to mass-market emails and completing micro tasks. As part of the acquisition, the crypto company will bring on Earn's founder and CEO, a former Andreessen Horowitz venture capitalist, as its first-ever chief technology officer. Coinbase reportedly valued itself at about $8 billion when it set out to buy Earn.com, according to Recode, much higher than a valuation of $1.6 billion at its last round of venture capitalist financing in summer 2017. In May, the company announced a fleet of products to cater to the institutional investor class, which has been especially cautious to dive into what has been a volatile asset class. Coinbase launched an index fund in March, and a month later launched Coinbase Ventures, an incubator fund for early-stage start-ups working in cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It has $15 million geared up for investments and recently announced its first deal with start-up Compound, which lets you lend or borrow cryptocurrency and earn an interest rate.

Banks have been slapped with vast sums for not preventing money being laundered through their accounts, and the call for action comes after Commonwealth Bank of Australia last week was fined a record $530 million for breaching money laundering and terror financing laws. The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said it would like to see greater use of new technologies in \"know your client\" or KYC anti-money laundering checks, as they promise to drastically cut costs. \"Fintech solutions, facial recognition for example, hold out great hope for the industry, but haven't been embraced as quickly as some might like by regulators around the world,\" said Mark Austen, chief executive of the association. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore said last year they were exploring whether KYC utilities, central repositories of data that banks can tap to save duplication when adding new clients, should be set up. But the process is taking time amid concerns about who would have liability when data was wrong. Grappling with compliance and the costs involved has become a onerous task for most banks and brokerages. In 2017, the number of employees working on KYC compliance in financial institutions reached an average of 307, jumping from just 68 a year earlier, the association said in its report. HSBC alone spent $3 billion last year on compliance. It tripled its compliance headcount between 2013 and 2017 and now employs 8,600 compliance staff. \"Whether KYC and AML (anti-money laundering) headcount will fall comes down to whether the institutions can automate - there are a lot trying to as it means they can cut costs and probably actually improve compliance,\" Austen added. The association called on its members to help regulators understand developments and harmonize standards as different KYC rules across the region raised costs for cross-border financial groups, who were also interpreting those rules in different ways. \"It would be good if financial institutions in Asia at least all thought about the issues around KYC in a similar way,\" said Will Haslet, partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, which contributed to the report. \"When we talk about the longer term solution of technology, consistency is necessary.\" ", "author": "Billy H.C.

Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon told CNBC the U.S. economy is in rare form and could continue to prove strong for years to come. In an exclusive joint interview with CNBC's Becky Quick, Dimon and Buffett cited several aspects of the economy as reasons for optimism. \"Right now, there's no question: It's feeling strong. I mean, if we're in the sixth inning, we have our sluggers coming to bat right now,\" Buffett said in the \"Squawk Box\" the interview that aired Thursday. \"I'm no good at predicting out two or three or five years from now, although I will say this: There's no question in my mind that America's going to be far ahead of where we are now 10, 20 and 30 years from now,\" the 87-year-old billionaire added. \"But right now, business is good. There's no question about it.\" But Buffett cautioned that a strong economy doesn't necessarily mean it's a good time to buy stocks. \"The decision on the stock market should be made independent of the current business outlook,\" Buffett said. \"I don't think you should buy stocks based on what you think the next six months or year is going to bring.\" Dimon \u2014 who has been J.P. Morgan CEO since 2005 \u2014 echoed Buffett's positive comments on economic growth, saying that the current uptrend in business could last years. \"The way I look at it, there is nothing that is a real pothole,\" he said. \"Business sentiment is almost at the highest level it's ever been, consumer sentiment is at its highest levels, markets are wide open, housing's in short supply and my guess is mortgage credit will expand a little bit.\" The two business leaders spoke as indicators of economic health continued to show strength. The unemployment rate, for example, fell to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, according to figures released Friday, while second-quarter growth may reach 4.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \"If you look at how the table's set, consumers are in very good shape,\" Dimon said. \"Their balance sheet, their incomes, wages are going up, their debt levels are low, all the credit written since the Great Recession is pristine, whether it's mortgage credit \u2014 other than student lending, which is done by the government.\" \"So,\" he concluded. \"It looks pretty good.\" ", "author": "David A.

The bank, a powerhouse in commodities trading for decades, had positioned itself to profit from volatility in natural gas prices that never materialized, according to people with knowledge of the situation. At rival firm Morgan Stanley, power and gas traders led by rising star Jay Rubenstein generated almost $400 million in revenue for the bank last year. The big narrative out of Wall Street after the financial crisis was that thanks to regulations and the rise of computerized trading, newly chastened human traders were no longer able to place big bets, capping their status and compensation. This is mostly true. But pockets of big risk-taking have persisted within the banks \u2014 and that could jump with last week's proposed changes to the Volcker Rule. show chapters Goldman's winning bet on volatility 7:17 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 01:22 Given new rules that broadly switch the stance on trades from a presumption of guilt to a presumption of innocence, traders and their overseers will be more comfortable taking bigger amounts of risk than under the current Volcker Rule, said sources on trading desks. With the prospect of market volatility returning after years of calm, a lower regulatory hurdle could come at exactly the right time for bank traders. Goldman and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, are seen as most likely to take advantage of trading opportunities across their fixed income, commodities and equities trading businesses, according to the sources. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America and London-based Barclays may take more risk in areas including distressed debt and equities, they said. The upshot: the odds that Wall Street traders can make a killing \u2013 or get killed \u2013 in the markets are about to increase. Facilitate markets The banks are adamant that these and other trades are done to facilitate markets. Nobody is claiming that any of the trades in this story violated the Volcker Rule. Furthermore, prudent risk-taking by banks can improve the liquidity of markets and act as moderators of price swings. But the question of what kinds of trading banks should be doing is in play again since the Federal Reserve last week proposed changes to the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from engaging in purely speculative bets, or proprietary trading. The move is part of sweeping changes to banking regulation that critics say are overly burdensome on banks and hamper the functioning of some markets. The trading rule, which was named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who originally proposed the regulation, was meant to prevent banks from acting as depositor-fueled hedge funds. It still had to allow them to make markets, or help clients buy and sell assets. But the line between prop trading and making markets is blurry, since banks often need to step in and purchase assets that don't change hands often, in effect taking bets to help facilitate markets. So firms are allowed to engage in proprietary trading if they claim it's in anticipation of client demand \u2014 an important gray area that traders can use to make more lucrative bets. Volcker 2.0 The changes, which are under a 60-day review period and dubbed Volcker 2.0, lift reporting burdens on short-term trades and replace a rule that traders only take positions in anticipation of near-term demand to giving banks leeway to set their own risk limits. The wildly divergent results at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley last year are an illustration of the risk-taking that already happens within the industry. There are other examples. A Goldman Sachs junk trader named Thomas Malafronte generated more than $250 million in 2016 by taking huge positions in the debt of retailers and energy firms, Bloomberg reported at the time. This year, the bank's flow derivatives desk, run by David Casner, made $200 million in profit on a single day in February with positions in a volatility index. A handful of senior traders at global investment banks have the ability, if an opportunity is identified and approved by risk committees, to be allowed much greater leeway to take directional bets, according to people with knowledge of the industry. Sometimes, only a small fraction of the original trade is offloaded to clients to justify the trade as market making, while the rest is held for gains, said the people. The riskier, more lucrative bets are seen as helping keep trading desks open for clients, since pure market making has become less profitable amid relatively placid markets and tight spreads between what sellers and buyers will agree to. \"If you're a market maker and you don't take an opportunity to strap on risk when you see an asymmetric payoff, why are you paying a guy who can do that to not do that?\" said a trader at a major Wall Street firm who declined to be identified speaking candidly. \"You've got to use your information and expertise to do stuff like that occasionally when you have good risk-reward.\" No return to pre-crisis levels Even among critics of the Volcker proposal, few claim banks risk going back to the wild days of a decade ago when the industry's dizzy leverage meant that small drops in asset values could wipe firms out. All the other post-financial crisis limitations that banks are subject to, including rules on capital, leverage, liquidity and stress tests should prevent trading from getting out of hand. The changes, which could be approved by five U.S. regulatory agencies by the end of this year, will make the most difference during the next financial crisis, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last week during a conference. \"It might not be a big change now, but it probably will create more liquidity in bad times, which is when you really need it,\" Dimon said. \"In bad times, you want market makers intermediating aggressively, standing in, giving you all a chance to buy and sell, modify your portfolios, adjust to inflows and outflows. And you needed that. A couple of banks did that aggressively in the crisis.\" Coincidentally, that is also when traders stand to make the most money and biggest bonuses. Spreads tend to be the highest in turbulent times when hedge funds and asset managers are desperate to sell holdings. Goldman Sachs had its most trading profitable year in 2009, when it generated more than $30 billion. When everyone else is selling, it's good to be the counterparty of last resort.

Criminals use what's known as the dark web to facilitate large-scale cryptocurrency theft. There are now an estimated 12,000 marketplaces and 34,000 offerings related to cryptotheft for hackers to choose from, the company said in a study released Thursday. \"It's surprising just how easy it is without any tech skill to commit cybercrimes like ransomware,\" Carbon Black Security strategist Rick McElroy told CNBC. \"It's not always these large nefarious groups, it's in anybody's hands.\" The necessary malware, which McElroy said even occasionally comes with customer service, costs an average of $224 and can be priced as low as $1.04. That marketplace has emerged as a $6.7 million economy, according to the study. The dark web is a part of the World Wide Web accessible only through special software. It lets users remain anonymous and largely untraceable. \"You just have to able to log in and be able to buy the thing \u2014 you can call customer support and they'll give you tips,\" McElroy said. Thefts can come from organized cartels or crime groups extorting exchanges and companies. But it is often as simple as a highly trained but unemployed engineer looking to make extra cash. \"You have nations that are teaching coding, but there's no jobs,\" McElroy said. \"It could just be two people in Romania needing to pay rent.\" As the price of bitcoin skyrocketed more than 1,300 percent last year, new buyers flooded the market. Unlike banks, cryptocurrency is typically not protected or insured by a third party, which first-time investors might not know. \"Usually we rely on banks, the tools are out there but investors need to know how to do this,\" McElroy said. \"A lot of people are unaware in this new gold rush, people are using cloud wallets and not securing their money.\" Exchanges were the most popular target for cybercriminals, making up 27 percent of attacks this year. Tokyo-based Mt.Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange at the time, was the first high-profile hack in cryptocurrency history. It filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and said it lost 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and 100,000 of the exchange's own. This January, hackers stole $530 million worth of a lesser-known cryptocurrency called NEM from Japanese exchange Coincheck. In December, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange called Youbit lost 17 percent of its digital assets and its parent Yapian later filed for bankruptcy. Businesses were the second most vulnerable group, making up 21 percent of those hacked. In many cases, criminals hack the internal system of these companies and demand cryptocurrency as a ransom. Carbon Black said it could not provide company names because some of the incidents were not public. In the U.S. companies don't have to report a ransomware incident because it does not involve a loss of personal data. Hackers often demand payment in cryptocurrency yet bitcoin does not seem to be the top choice. It accounted for only about 10 percent of the targeted cryptocurrencies, while ethereum made up 11 percent. Criminals appear to prefer monero. The lesser-known cryptocurrency was used in 44 percent of all attacks because of its privacy and its difficulty to trace compared with bitcoin, Carbon Black said. It also has relatively low transaction fees. The United States was the most vulnerable country, with 24 crypto-related attacks. China was next with 10, and the U.K. came in third with eight.

But quarterly guidance \u2014 which only 28 percent of companies offered in 2016 \u2014 is only part of the problem. The bigger problem for boards and CEOs is a fear of rattling a company's stock price. \"This price decline we believe CEOs are terrified of ... they find that embarrassing ... instead of telling the truth, they try to strengthen [their quarterly numbers] and by doing so, they can damage the firm,\" B. Espen Eckbo, the Tuck Centennial chair in finance at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Getting rid of quarterly guidance does not get rid of analysts creating benchmarks for a company to miss or make. It doesn't prevent share dips of a company when it announces that a new drug trial was not successful or it must close stores. A CEO's job is to brave that impact and the board's role is to give a CEO leeway. The best a company can do is to prepare the market for the reality. The ability to do so is particularly important in industries like food and retail, which are in the process of reshaping their portfolios and business models in the glare of the public eye. Those efforts are costly and not always predictable. Kroger, which has been making investments its e-commerce business to battle Amazon, weathered an 11 percent drop in its share price in March when it warned analysts of lower profit margins for 2018. \"You should expect gross margin to decline somewhat in 2018,\" Kroger CFO Mike Schlotman told analysts. \"We aren't giving guidance on the individual amounts.\" Kroger shortly thereafter announced two significant e-commerce acquisitions, putting more context around that caution \u2014 and Kroger's broader plans. Meantime, there are other changes a company can make: getting rid of payment incentives based on earnings, and changing corporate culture to shift focus away from the stock price. \"Implicitly [Dimon and Buffett] are telling CEOs we need to change things \u2014 we can't have you manipulate internal earnings just to fit some predictions. You're supposed to tell the truth, the way things are, without cutting short on any investment,\" said Eckbo.

Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency platform Circle is seeking a federal banking license and plans to register with the SEC as a brokerage and trading venue, Bloomberg reported this week. \"We believe both companies would only make these moves if their perception of regulatory risks in crypto was improving,\" Lee said, calling their announcements \"implicit acknowledgement\" that the regulatory tide is shifting. Regulatory crackdowns and announcements from the SEC have been a headwind for bitcoin prices this year. Prices fell below $10,000 in March after the agency said it would require digital asset exchanges to register with the agency and have struggled to recover since. Bitcoin has slumped more than 45 percent since January, according to CoinDesk. The digital currency was trading near $7,689 as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday. Lee and others in the space have argued that uncertainty from regulators has held back demand for cryptocurrency and prevented institutional investors from entering the market. A key debate is how to classify what cryptocurrency is, and how it should be regulated. In a CNBC interview Wednesday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said while bitcoin is not a security, tokens from initial coin offerings are. The CFTC, on the other hand, regulates them as commodities. The supply-demand dynamics have changed drastically from last year, when investors flooded the market as bitcoin neared the $20,000 mark in December. Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to issue formal price targets on bitcoin, pointed to a sharp increase in cryptocurrency supply in 2018 and lower demand after investors sold bitcoin holdings to meet tax requirements. More than $9 billion has been raised in ICOs this year, according to data from Autonomous Next, more than 2.5 times the entire ICO market last year. Meanwhile, households sold roughly $25 billion in cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars in order to pay for capital gains taxes they owed, according to Fundstrat. Lee estimated a $37 billion net drop in demand this year. The SEC and other U.S. regulators have been tasked with policing fast-paced innovation and protecting investors from fraud. Robert Cohen, chief of the Cyber Unit in the Division of Enforcement at the SEC, said Thursday that while the agency is heavily focused on fraud, it is being cautious not to hurt innovation. \"We want to encourage innovation and new ways of raising capital,\" Cohen said at the New York Blockchain and Digital Assets Summit Thursday. \"If there's a new and exciting tech people should have an opportunity to invest in it.\" The agency created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. The agency has cracked down on ICOs this year: It has continuously warned of pump-and-dump schemes, issued subpoenas and charged multiple coin projects with fraud. \"Every time there's an exciting new technology, people are afraid of missing out they see people becoming millionaires overnight, there's a high risk of people falling victim to fraud,\" Cohen said.

He was responding to comments by Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who in a joint interview with CNBC, urged CEOs to end quarterly profit forecasts. \"Short-term gives you some focus; long-term gives you future,\" Bossidy said Thursday in a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"And you should have incentives that promote that.\" Buffett and Dimon said short-term forecasts run counter the long-term interests of a company. \"I've never seen a company whose performance has been improved by having some forecast out there by the CEO that we're going to earn 'X,'\" Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC's Becky Quick. \"It's also teaching the people that live under [the CEO] that quarterly performance is the end game,\" Buffett added. Dimon, chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, also pointed out some of the \"ills and problems\" of short-term forecasts. \"It can often put a company in a position where management, from the CEO down, feel obligated [to deliver certain results] or may do things that otherwise have done,\" Dimon said. The two also voiced their concerns in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, saying the practice is bad for the economy. Dimon said the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of which Dimon is the chairman, supports companies that do not give short-term forecasts. Wall Street analysts use a company's sales and profit forecasts for research and to help investors pick stocks. The numbers can often move the market if they're wrong or reduce volatility if accurate. Berkshire Hathaway does not give guidance. Buffett told CNBC that \"it's a very, very bad practice. And once it gets going it feeds on itself.\" The businessman said he's met some good CEOs \u2014 some he wouldn't even mind if they were married to his daughter \u2014 but said once the predictions are made egos often get involved. \"When they find they can't make the numbers, sometimes they make up the numbers,\" Buffett said. Michael Thompson, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, pointed out that the market is forward-looking. \"How do you value the companies?\" Thompson asked during a \"Squawk Box\" interview on Thursday. \"Less information begets less liquidity begets bigger gaps [and] more volatility,\" Thompson said. \"The guidance is what people are trading on.\" Bossidy said Buffett and Dimon's practices are \"not totally unrealistic,\" but he still has reservations. \"I do think these two business luminaries have a point,\" he said. \"But there's going to be forecasts whether they make them or not.\" Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

It leads to nothing that is good. They manipulate earnings to reach it. They take their eye off the football,\" the chairman and chief investment officer at The Olstein Funds said Thursday on \"Closing Bell.\" Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and Dimon, chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, teamed up in a rare joint interview that aired on CNBC earlier in the day to explain their stance. Executives often feel pressure to make quarterly forecasts, but \"it can often put a company in a position where management from the CEO down feels obligated to deliver earnings and therefore may do things that they wouldn't otherwise have done,\" Dimon said. Companies forecast sales and profit numbers to Wall Street analysts, who use them to produce research and stock recommendations for investors. Missing \"the number\" can often result in big, short-term stock moves. Making a forecast, and then hitting the target, are seen as a way to manage expectations and eliminate volatility. However, Olstein has a different way to evaluate businesses. \"You value companies on a company's ability to generate long-term free cash flow,\" he said. However, Romit Shah, a senior analyst at Nomura Instinet, said he is a big believer in corporate quarterly guidance. That is what \"gives us the opportunity to go through a checklist of items and actually see if these companies are executing the plans,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" \"In my mind it's a question of transparency. More transparency is better than less transparency,\" added Shah, who has been an analyst for 20 years.

The agriculture department of Henan, which lies about 450 miles southwest of Beijing, said on its website Wednesday it will \"actively guide\" farmers to expand the soybean planting area by 500,000 mu (82,370 acres). The province had 300,000 mu dedicated to soybeans as of June 1, the provincial government said. \"China's policy in 2017 had shifted toward encouraging soybean acreage [for 2018] instead of corn,\" said Rich Nelson, director of research at Allendale, an agricultural market research and trading firm. Henan province contributed 5 percent to Chinese soybean production in 2008-2010 Source: USDA China is the world's largest consumer of soybeans and the destination for well over half of U.S. soybeans. In April, Beijing threatened tariffs on U.S. soybeans and other products in retaliation against the Trump administration's proposed duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The two countries are still in negotiations. In the meantime, China's agriculture ministry forecast in May that the country will cut its imports of soybeans in the 2018-2019 marketing year for the first time in 15 years. Soybean acreage is set to increase 7.8 percent to roughly 21 million acres, the ministry said, according to a Reuters report. That follows this year's growth of 9.8 percent, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service said in an August 2017 report. The agency also noted that Heilongjiang, China's largest soybean-producing province, increased its acreage for the crop by 15.8 percent to its largest since 2011.

Bob Martin, the company's CEO, said in a statement Wednesday that while labor costs during the fiscal third quarter moderated, \"we are experiencing inflationary price increases in certain raw material and commodity based components due in large part to the headwinds created by the announcement and implementation of the steel and aluminum tariffs and other regulatory actions, as well as higher warranty costs.\" The stock fell as much as 7.3 percent on Thursday before closing 2.4 percent higher.

The move has left investors on edge as fears that full-blown trade war between the U.S. and its trade partners could lie ahead.

Bloomberg previously reported the talks. Dialog, which has a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, is smaller than Synaptics, whose market capitalization is about $1.5 billion. No deal is assured, said the people, who asked not to be named because discussions are private. Talks have been ongoing for months, the sources said. Dialog's initial offer in March for Synaptics was about $59 per share and all cash, according to a person familiar with the matter. Synaptics rejected that offer, so if a deal gets done, it will probably be at a higher price than that, the person said. Dialog's share price has plummeted, down more than 60 percent in the past 52 weeks. Dialog shares fell 17 percent last week, to a four-year low, after Apple said it would cut orders for its power-management chips by around 30 percent this year. Dialog told investors that Apple planned to source its main power-management chips (PMICs) for one of its three new iPhone models from two suppliers instead of just from Dialog. Both Dialog and Synaptics have dealt with botched acquisitions in recent years. Synaptics couldn't close on a sale to a China-based buyer in 2016, and Dialog failed to acquire Atmel the same year when Microchip made a superior offer. A deal, if completed, will test regulators' appetite to approve cross-border semiconductor transactions. Companies have been reluctant to move forward with global acquisitions since the U.S. government blocked Broadcom's attempt at buying Qualcomm earlier this year. A spokesman for Synaptics declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Dialog couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Here is what's happening to U.S. trade accounts under Trump's stewardship: Last year, America's deficit on goods trade widened to $810 billion, marking an annual increase of 7.6 percent, after a 1.3 percent decline in 2016. That trade deterioration was partly due to the economy's accelerating growth to 2.3 percent from 1.5 percent in 2016. Still, despite Trump's promises, there was no narrowing of deficits with any of America's main trade partners. In fact, particularly large deficit increases were noted last year with Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 in that order of importance. So far this year, the trade gap looks much worse. In the first four months, the deficit was 10.1 percent above its year-earlier level. Over the same period, the trade gaps with the European Union and China widened at annual rates of 17.5 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively. The trade deficit with Japan also increased 5.3 percent. Trade-challenged Trump Again, some of the continuing deterioration of trade accounts is owed to America's considerably faster growth in the last two quarters. But that also shows that U.S. trade policy is unable to plug the soaring leakages of the huge fiscal and monetary stimulation of domestic demand. That must be infuriating to the president who stakes his credibility on keeping the promises made about major policy objectives. The entire external sector of the American economy is getting worse because China, the European Union and Japan seem unwilling to allow the U.S. to reduce its unsustainably large trade deficits in an orderly manner. Those three economies account for nearly 75 percent of America's $810 billion deficit, but they are still accusing Washington of protectionism and destruction of the multilateral trading system. That attitude is something one could expect from China, but not from presumably friendly allies like the European Union and Japan. For China, at issue is 4.1 percent of its total demand and output \u2014 a share of exports to the U.S. in China's nominal GDP. Apart from that, there are structural problems requiring massive adjustments in China's manufacturing sectors that have been set up, with the help of U.S. investments and technology, as a world's export powerhouse. Washington's trade and economic policy dialogue with China is also very difficult in an atmosphere of sensitive security considerations. China is a country that Washington defines as a \"strategic competitor\" and a \"revisionist power\" intent on changing the Western (i.e., American) world order. At the same time, ongoing military confrontations about China's contested maritime borders, and Washington's diplomatic gestures toward Taiwan, perceived by Beijing as another challenge to its territorial integrity, are not an auspicious background for confident agreements on half-a-trillion-dollar trade issues. Washington also made things difficult for itself by allowing the problem to slip into the meanders of contentious and slow-moving technical negotiations. Kick up the trade agenda The problem should have been kept at the highest level of state, where it is easily understood that China's $375 billion annual trade surplus with the U.S. is unacceptably large. A consensus would then follow for a prompt and steady action to balance the bilateral trade books. Had things been done that way, it would have been politically impossible for Beijing to maintain a belligerent attitude of being \"locked and loaded\" for a trade war while its surpluses with the U.S. continue to soar at annual rates of 12 percent. It might still be possible to push the trade issue with China back to Trump's agenda of key national security considerations. That's probably what China expects because Trump originally linked up bilateral trade imbalances with Korean nukes and other East Asian problems. Trump seems to have successfully tested that approach at the G-7 summit last week by impressing the European leaders to take his trade warnings seriously. Germans were the first to respond. With the external sector accounting for 84 percent of the economy, Berlin always keeps trade issues at the top of the state's agenda. So, to tone down the European trade rhetoric with Washington, and to make tangible progress on rebalancing trade accounts, Berlin is now setting up a special EU group to deal with American trade transactions. Interestingly, Germany is considerably raising its purchases of American products. In the first four months of this year, U.S. exports to Germany soared 11.7 percent. That is double the rate of increase of U.S. exports to Japan, and four percentage points above the increase of American sales to China. Germans appear to be deeply worried by rumors that Trump intends to put heavy import duties on automobiles. Partly as a result of that, Germans have now become the main advocates of a calm and thoughtful approach to trans-Atlantic relations, and seem ready to work with Washington on improving access of American businesses to EU markets. Washington expects that Japan will take the same approach in dismantling its formidable barriers to entry for American car manufacturers and a broad range of U.S. consumer goods industries. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a refresher chat about that from Trump in a separate meeting on the way to the G-7 summit. As the president would say, let's see what happens. Investment thoughts The EU, China and Japan are complaining about the alleged U.S. protectionist policies while continuing to accumulate large surpluses on their American trades. That is unacceptable, unsustainable and very dangerous for world trade and asset markets. Unless those surpluses begin to narrow radically in the months ahead, Washington will be pushed to introduce restrictive trade measures. Driven by a large fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policies, the U.S. economy is poised to remain on a growth path of about 3 percent for the rest of this year. Rising corporate sales and subdued unit labor costs bode well for profits and equity prices.

Conference and Exhibition Center on April 23, 2018 in Fuzhou, Fujian Province of China. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial is now reportedly worth more than Goldman Sachs, thanks largely to dominance in two trends that have swept China: mobile payments and money market funds for consumers. Ant Financial announced Friday Beijing time that it raised about $14 billion. The funding values the company at around $150 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Widely followed Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker also listed a market value of $150 billion for Ant Financial in her internet trends report last week, which ranked it as the ninth-largest internet company in the world. In contrast, publicly traded Goldman Sachs was worth about $88 billion on Friday. show chapters Ant Financial nears $10 billion equity raise, sources tell CNBC 7:16 AM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 | 01:45 Ant Financial's road to a $150 billion valuation has been a quick one. The company grew out of Alipay, the digital payments system that launched in 2004 and contributed significantly to Alibaba's ability to succeed in e-commerce. When Alibaba went public in 2014, it officially launched Ant Financial through a spin-off. Today, the company operates some of the key financial services businesses in the massive Chinese market. They include: Alipay \u2014 Similar to how PayPal processes payments for eBay, Alipay handles transactions on Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. But Alipay has expanded to supporting mobile payments in stores and restaurants, a trend that has taken off in the last few years and essentially eliminated the need for cash in China. Alipay has 870 million active users, with nearly a third outside China, a company representative said. It's possible to use the mobile pay app in parts of the U.S. as well. Yu'e Bao \u2014 The operator of the largest money market fund in the world lets consumers invest with as little as one yuan (16 cents) and can offer interest rates of nearly 4 percent or more. It has more than 400 million users and launched two new funds in May. The oldest fund, run by Tianhong Asset Management, launched in 2013 and had 1.7 trillion yuan in assets at the end of March, according to Reuters. Integration with Alipay often means users of the mobile payments app will store their spare change with Yu'e Bao. It's name literally means \"leftover treasure.\" Zhima Credit \u2014 Beijing is trying to develop a social credit system. Ant Financial's Zhima Credit has created a private credit platform. A spokesperson for the company said the service is not contracted to run, nor is it a private version of the government system. Ant Financial also noted Zhima Credit is an opt-in feature for Alipay users. Zhima Credit tracks bill payments, spending habits, friends' scores and other personal information to algorithmically produce an individual's score. The platform offers perks to users with good numbers, while denying services such as train ticket purchases to those with bad scores. Ant Financial also operates lending businesses through MyBank and Huabei. The company is widely expected to go public in the next year or so. This story has been updated to reflect that Zhima Credit is a private credit platform.

The Federal Reserve is due to announce another rate hike this Wednesday and won't take any notice of the spat between the U.S. and its Western allies over trade tariffs, an economist told CNBC Monday. Market players are monitoring the rhetoric surrounding trade between the U.S. and the other six world-leading economies after divergences at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump revoked his support for a joint statement after the meeting, following comments from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The latter said though he did not want to \"punish American workers\", he would be pressing ahead with retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. As a result, President Trump called Trudeau \"dishonest and weak\" and warned the other G-7 leaders that retaliation against his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, first announced in March, would be a mistake. However, the trade tensions are likely to be ignored by the Fed given the positive economic data in the U.S., according to Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, who told CNBC that the Fed meeting \"will almost certainly result in another rate hike, along with the message that continued tightening is likely.\" Speaking to CNBC's Squawk Box Europe, O'Sullivan said that the G-7 leaders \"are playing with fire here in terms of all the protectionist talk. The hope is, in the end, that a serious trade war is averted, not to say that there won't be tariffs on a small amount of goods compared to the overall size of the economy.\" show chapters Economist: Hope sense will prevail on trade policy 3:56 AM ET Mon, 11 June 2018 | 03:23 Earlier this month, data showed that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May. Economists had estimated 188,000. Last week, initial claims for state unemployment benefits also decreased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 \u2014 economists had estimated an increase. The positive data has confirmed expectations that the Fed is on track to deliver another rate hike this Wednesday. \"The Fed is expected to raise policy rates by 25 basis points. That's largely priced in,\" Tai Hui, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management told CNBC via email Monday. \"More importantly, its updated projections on growth, inflation, jobless rate and policy rate will be closely scrutinized,\" he said. However, experts warn a potential trade war carries risks for global growth and markets. \"The biggest source of downside risk here \u2026 is a trade war mongering... It is disturbing the way this is developing,\" O'Sullivan told CNBC. \"Without all this trade mongering, the U.S. equity market would be higher than what it is today, and maybe the economic numbers would be even stronger than what they are, but the net result is, the U.S. economic data continue to be strong, more than strong enough to keep the employment rate coming down,\" O'Sullivan said. Commenting on the G-7 meeting, Hui said \"business confidence and, subsequently, capital spending is at risk if this (trade) tension continues through the summer. This could cast a long shadow over global growth, which has rebounded in recent weeks after a soft start to the year.\" ", "author": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/11/fed-will-ignore-g-7-trade-spat-and-announce-new-rate-hikes-economist-says.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Adam Jeffery", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The U.S. Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Washington", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "D.C.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Western", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "six", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the Group of Seven", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the weekend", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Canadian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Justin Trudeau", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "American", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Trudeau", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Jim O'Sullivan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "High Frequency Economics", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Squawk Box Europe", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "O'Sullivan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the G-7", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "3:56 AM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "11 June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "223,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May.", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "188,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "222,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "25", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Tai Hui", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "J.P.

Bonner is head of talent analytics at hedge fund Point72, a job that gives her access to data like compensation and college grade point averages for individuals hired by the firm. But as she tells it, that data unveiled a gross injustice \u2014 one that, inspired by the broader #MeToo movement, encouraged her to take action. In February, Bonner filed a gender-bias lawsuit against Connecticut-based Point72, though she continues to go to work at the firm's Manhattan office every day. \"I certainly tried to make change internally,\" Bonner told CNBC in her first television interview. \"I just couldn't let it go. I couldn't walk away from the problem. It's too important. It was too blatant, and it's been going on for way too long. I just couldn't help but fight it.\" show chapters View inside Point72 lawsuit 9:25 AM ET Mon, 11 June 2018 | 04:17 In her lawsuit, filed in New York federal court, Bonner accuses Point72, as well as its founder, the well-known hedge-fund manager Steven Cohen, and its now-former president Douglas Haynes of sexism. Bonner said they violated equal-pay laws, engaged in gender discrimination and retaliated against her by denying a promotion after she reported her superior for harassment. In a statement to CNBC, Point72 said, \"Contrary to Ms. Bonner's assertions, this lawsuit is replete with allegations that are false or based on unsubstantiated hearsay and that she never brought to the attention of Firm management.\" Bonner continues to go to work at Point72, a situation she described as, \"awkward but also not that bad.\" She said previously she would come to work \"demoralized,\" but now she feels \"a little bit more positive\" about what she's doing. Does Wall Street have an institutional bias? Bonner's claim intertwines stories of harassment, data on pay disparity and a lack of diversity among the senior ranks at the firm, as well as the obstacles she faced in climbing the ladder. She said that all of these issues are some form of discrimination against women. \"What I saw over time, looking through the data, was that there was an institutional bias that was so entrenched that it just made it pretty impossible for women to advance economically or professionally,\" she said. CNBC Lauren Bonner In her claim, Bonner said that of the 125 portfolio managers that Point72 employs, all but one are men. She said there is only one woman among 32 managing directors. Bonner also points to last year's new hires, of whom, she said, only 21 percent were women; none was brought in as portfolio manager or managing director, she said. One new director was a woman, while 14 were men, she said. \"I see things like female candidates coming out of college have to have GPAs and SATs that are 20 percent to 25 percent higher than their male peers to get the exact same job,\" Bonner said in the interview. \"I absolutely believe it's due to an inherent bias against women,\" said Jeanne Christensen, a partner at Wigdor LLP, the law firm representing Bonner in her claim. \"It just seems very suspect that you would have an extremely successful company with not one woman at the top.\" In the claim, Bonner compared her own compensation with the pay of specific male colleagues. She had been seeking a promotion to the director level from associate director but was denied. She said she believes her inability to move up at Point72 (and narrow the pay gap) was because she reported one of the members of the promotion committee to human resources for alleged harassment. She said he retaliated against her by not granting her the title of director. 'Too aggressive' for a promotion Bonner had only been at Point72 for about 18 months when she filed the lawsuit but said her short tenure was not a factor in the promotion committee's decision. \"It couldn't be experience because men with lesser and worse experience came in at a higher level than I did \u2014 off the bat,\" Bonner said. \"It's also hard to imagine that it has anything to do with performance because I got the highest possible performance reviews.\" Bonner said she was told she was \"too aggressive to be promoted.\" \"You certainly don't build a cutting-edge technology platform by being a hothouse petunia, so I certainly had to be assertive to get things done,\" she said. \"It's confusing to be labeled with that word, aggressive, when it's a culture of performance, and men are specifically told to be more aggressive and to break more china.\" Bonner alleges that men with less experience and fewer responsibilities were coming into Point72 at the director level, which ranks above associate director. She said her compensation was as low as 35 cents on the dollar that these men made. Bonner says that she hasn't seen instances of women making more than men who were doing the same job at Point72. \"I don't think this is a question of nuance,\" she said. A spokesperson for Point72 said the firm \"was already addressing the underrepresentation of women and minorities \u2014 a reality across the finance industry \u2014 with a series of initiatives designed to recruit and support them before Ms. Bonner was hired. In fact, she was involved with some of those initiatives.\" Adam Jeffery | CNBC Point 72 Asset Management. \"But instead of working with us constructively to advance our goals of diversity and inclusion \u2014 and after only 18 months of employment at the Firm \u2014 Ms. Bonner demanded $13 million, and sued when that demand was rejected.\" A representative for Bonner declined to comment on the $13 million figure. An internal review of the firm's culture Point72 is seeking to move the case from court to arbitration, where the merits of it would be argued out of the public eye. That decision is up to a judge, who has yet to rule on the firm's request. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Steve Cohen at Point 72 Asset Management. Regardless of the forum, Bonner will find herself up against a defendant who is known for his dogged battles through the court system. Cohen's former hedge fund, SAC Capital, paid a record $1.8 billion fine to the government to settle charges of insider trading brought against the firm in 2013. Cohen himself was charged in a civil case by the Securities and Exchange Commission with failure to supervise his employees and was banned from managing outside capital as part of a settlement. He did not admit or deny wrongdoing, and the ban was lifted earlier this year. Also this year, Point72 hired the law firm WilmerHale to conduct an internal review into the firm's culture. Cohen announced several changes in April following the review, including expanded parental leave and the creation of \"Chief Inclusion and Engagement Officer.\" \"We conducted an internal review for Point72 because Steve Cohen wanted to ensure that his firm was living up to its stated values,\" said WilmerHale's Jamie Gorelick, who led the review. \"He fully embraced changes that we suggested in a way that is rare for a corporate leader. I think that the firm's culture is already stronger.\" The firm has previously said that the review was not in response to Bonner's lawsuit. Haynes as well as Michael Butler, head of human resources, departed the firm between March and April. Haynes couldn't be reached for comment. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Doug Haynes, former President of Point 72 Asset Management. In an email to CNBC, Butler said he decided to retire after four years as Point72's head of human capital and will act as a consultant to the firm until the fall. \"I am extremely proud of the transformational work we did with our Human Capital team during my tenure, finding new ways to source, select, develop, reward and retain our employees. We delivered on our Mission to create the greatest opportunities to the industry's brightest talent. \" Bonner said she doesn't know if the departures were a result of the suit, only to say \"They left shortly after I filed.\" \"The real win I hope for is an intolerance of bad behavior at the firm,\" Bonner said. \"And ultimately, of course, I hope for gender parity and equal pay.\" When asked whether her job has changed at all since she filed the lawsuit, Bonner said, \"My role is the same, but I'm a little less busy than I used to be.\" Bonner, who has previously worked at the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Associates, conceded that sexism is an \"industry-wide issue,\" but added that it's \"particularly acute at Point72.\" But so far no other women have publicly signed onto her lawsuit or filed a similar one against Point72. And few have come forward to call out any type of systematic bias on Wall Street. \"There's a reason more stories haven't come out, and it's not for lack of stories,\" Bonner said. \"They haven't come out because of this culture of this small boys club that you really have to know other people to get jobs.\" There are some other high profile gender bias cases on Wall Street. In March, a federal judge cleared the way for a class action lawsuit against Goldman Sachs. Four women who are former employees sued the bank in 2010 over allegations of systemic gender bias, including discrimination in pay and job promotion. Goldman has asked the court of appeals to review the decision. As for what hedge funds and other financial institutions can and should be doing to make the environment better for women, Bonner said it's as simple as awareness by leadership. \"Choose to be intolerant of bad behavior,\" she said. \"It may be uncomfortable to call someone out. But that's what actually changes a culture. And I would say for leaders at funds to actually embrace intolerance of poor behavior, would actually go a long way.\" ", "author": "CNBC", "link":

Grogan | CNBC Jack Ma Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Jack Ma's e-commerce giant Alibaba, is using some of the $14 billion treasure chest it just raised to invest in blockchain. Ant Financial owns and operates China's largest online and mobile payments network Alipay. The company, carved out from Alibaba Group seven years ago, is now worth a reported $150 billion after closing one of the biggest capital raises on record. The funds raised in the Series C round will be set aside to accelerate Alipay's globalization plans and invest in developing technology to further \"enhance the company's ability to deliver inclusive financial services.\" Part of that plan includes blockchain. \"The Company will continue to invest in developing its blockchain, AI, security, IoT and computing capabilities to upgrade its global technology platform for the next generation,\" Ant Financial said in a statement. While most financial institutions have steered clear of bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies, CEOs across industries are investing heavily in blockchain. Global spending on blockchain solutions is set to more than double to $2.1 billion this year, according to a May 24 Cowen report. Jamie Dimon, for example, called bitcoin a \"fraud\" in September and later said those \"stupid enough to buy it\" will one day pay the price. But he called blockchain \"good technology,\" and J.P. Morgan developed its blockchain technology called Quorum two years ago for clearing and settling derivatives and cross-border payments. Blockchain technology is what's known as \"decentralized\" and is considered by advocates to be tamper-proof, cheaper, and more efficient. Bad actors would need to hack into multiple systems to change any information, making the data almost unhackable. It also speeds up transaction efficiency and gets rid of the need for a third-party intermediary, like a bank. The technology is being applied to everything from health care, to the auto industry, to the legal marijuana industry. But skeptics like noted economist Nouriel Roubini have called it \"'one of the most overhyped technologies ever.\" ", "author": "David A.

Marcus upgraded shares of Dexcom to overweight and raised his price target on the company to $115 from $80, implying 28 percent upside over the next year. Dexcom, which produces devices that attach to a patient's skin to monitor blood-glucose levels continuously, has the potential to crush consensus revenue estimates, the analyst added.

A disappointing outcome could hurt European stocks, the study showed. President Donald Trump is set to hold a historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore beginning Monday evening EDT. It's uncertain whether the leaders can agree on issues such as immediate denuclearization and sanctions relief. The meeting itself was temporarily canceled by Trump. But if the two leaders come closer to a resolution, Chinese stocks are particularly poised to benefit, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho, a quantitative analytics tool used by hedge funds. The iShares China large-cap ETF (FXI) climbed an average 0.9 percent in the two trading days after talks between leaders of North and South Korea that indicated improved relations. The study looked at 19 instances since Kim assumed power in late 2011. FXI tracks companies such as Tencent, Bank of China, PetroChina and Air China, a state carrier that said earlier this month it is resuming flights between Beijing and Pyongyang. The majority of North Korea's trade is with China, which supplies most of the rogue state's oil. Other global markets tend to gain after talks between South and North Korea. The iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY), iShares S&P Europe 350 Index ETF (IEV) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (EEM) all climbed about half a percent on average, the Kensho study showed. In the U.S., the S&P 500 rose an average 0.2 percent, according to Kensho. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of fear, drops 3 percent on average. When worries about North Korea's nuclear threat escalate, European and emerging market stocks are among the worst performers, according to Kensho. IEV and EEM each fall half a percent on average in the two days following a successful missile test or a particularly aggressive statement from the Trump administration, according to Kensho. The study looked at 25 such occasions since Kim took power. South Korean stocks tended to fall about a third of a percent, while the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) declined a quarter of a percent, on average, when tensions around North Korea increase, the Kensho analysis found. The VIX jumps 5.6 percent on average. The S&P 500 and China's FXI trade positive roughly 50 percent of the time, no better than a coin flip. WATCH: US-N.

Discussions have been taking place for months, according to several people briefed on the negotiations, but they slowed in recent weeks during Italy's political crisis. Any deal would solidify BlackRock's standing and further disrupt the continental European market, which is tightly controlled by domestic banks and insurers. More from the Financial Times: Italian assets rally on finance minister's pledge to keep euro Poundworld files for bankruptcy HSBC chief Flint promises return to 'growth mode' The thrust of the talks has been over a distribution arrangement between the two. Tommasso Corcos, chief executive of Eurizon, has stated he would sell up to a fifth of the business and that he wanted to conclude a deal by the end of the year. BlackRock, which manages $6.3tn globally, is understood to be seeking a 10 percent stake. Financial terms have yet to be agreed. Olivia Michael | CNBC Larry Fink On behalf of its clients, BlackRock holds 5 percent of Intesa Sanpaolo, which owns Eurizon, making it the Italian lender's second-biggest shareholder. The New York-based manager is keen to gain more influence in Italy, which is dominated by distribution networks operated by banks and insurers. Eurizon, meanwhile, hopes to leverage a relationship with a global asset manager to gain access to clients worldwide. Last year Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said he expected the mergers and acquisition wave in asset management to continue, but said his company would restrict itself to smaller deals. It has since taken a minority stake in UK robo-adviser Scalable Capital, acquired $9bn alternatives manager Tennenbaum Capital Partners and bought Cachematrix, a financial technology provider. It has also acquired the asset management division of Citibanamex, Citigroup's Mexican operation. BlackRock has expanded aggressively in Europe over the past decade and is the region's largest manager by assets. The $1.8bn it oversees in Europe represents 28 percent of the company's total and provides 30 percent of its revenue. In Italy, it is the fifth largest wealth manager, with a 4 percent market share. Carlo Messina, Intesa chief executive, told the Financial Times in April that the bank was looking for a partner for Eurizon. \"We are studying the possibility to make a strategic alliance with a big player in assets under management and we are ready to also sell a minority stake in order to have a possibility to play a game of consolidation of assets under management in Europe,\" he said.

The risk to the market long term is the Fed: Cole Smead 2:01 PM ET Fri, 8 June 2018 | 05:01 The Federal Reserve could have a surprise in store for investors this week, even if everyone already knows the central bank is raising interest rates. Along with the quarter-point increase in the Fed's benchmark short-term target, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee is likely to announce another change that would signal an early exit from its history-making program to reduce the level of bonds being held on its balance sheet. The mechanics are a little complicated. Yet it suggests that what once appeared to be an operation to shrink the amount of bonds the Fed owns that would have run well into the next decade could be wrapped up next year, or early 2020 at the latest. Instead of reducing the balance sheet from its peak of $4.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion or so as some Fed officials indicated, the impact could be far less \u2014 perhaps, some suggest, to $3.5 trillion or even a little more. It all depends on how tight financial markets get. Tightening in the money markets, and an unexpected push of the fed funds rate toward the high end of its target range, would be key factors in prompting the Fed to re-examine its policy normalization efforts from financial crisis extremes. If the balance sheet runoff ends sooner then anticipated, investors probably can expect that the rate-hiking cycle could wrap up a bit earlier as well. \"There is a very active debate, and it's probably really going to take hold at the August meeting, about how far the balance sheet contraction should really go,\" said Fed expert Lou Crandall, chief economist at research service Wrightson ICAP. \"It's easy to get breathless about this and say the Fed's got a crisis. On the other hand, this is revealing that there are fewer truly surplus reserves in the system than we might have thought,\" he added. The predicament indeed seems far from a crisis. But the upcoming deliberations will give investors a window into how the Fed will unwind the stimulus it injected to help pull the economy out of the financial crisis, and ultimately how the market will react. So far, the balance sheet reduction has proceeded with minimal market disruptions, but much work remains ahead of the central bank. The mechanics Here's how it all works: Since the financial crisis, the Fed had been a major player in the Treasurys market, snapping up nearly $2 trillion worth during three rounds of bond-buying that began in late 2008. Private demand has been left to pick up the slack since the Fed ended quantitative easing in 2016. In October, the Fed began allowing a set amount of proceeds from its bond holdings to run off each month, while reinvesting the rest. Since that operation began, there has been a $102 billion reduction in Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities on the balance sheet. Concurrent with that has been a gain in interest rates, as the Fed also has raised its funds level; meanwhile, some upward pressure has built on government bond yields as the central bank has reduced its role in that part of the market. Aaron P. Bernstein | Reuters Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meetings in Washington, March 21, 2018. Most recently, the funds rate has risen to near the top of the 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent target range the FOMC set after March's hike. Specifically, the benchmark is at 1.7 percent, just 0.05 points away from the interest on excess reserves the Fed pays to banks that store cash at the central bank. The interest rate on excess reserves (IOER), as it is known, historically has served as a guide for the funds rate, and usually runs a bit above the Fed's benchmark. According to minutes from the May meeting, FOMC officials are concerned that the funds rate is rising a bit more quickly than anticipated, causing a tightening in money markets that would make a more aggressive unwind of the balance sheet problematic. A solution suggested at the meeting was that the Fed raise the rate paid on reserves by 0.2 percent while it hikes the funds rate 0.25 percent. Doing so would be expected to hold back the funds rate from getting too close to the target ceiling, judging by the funds rate's tendency to trail behind the IOER rate. \"We believe the Fed took this action since it has become increasingly concerned with the tightening in money markets over recent months and the pace by which its target fed funds effective rate is moving toward IOER,\" Mark Cabana, rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a recent note to clients. \"While much of the money market tightening is due to U.S. fiscal policy (higher deficits and [Treasury] cash balance) we believe nascent signs of reserve scarcity are contributing to the move,\" he added. Cabana sees the balance sheet reduction concluding \"toward the end of 2019 or in early 2020 at the latest, with risks for an earlier-than-expected end to the unwind depending on the Fed's choice of monetary policy framework.\" Part of the calculus will be predicated on the amount of excess reserves running off. Banks currently are holding nearly $1.9 trillion more than required at the Fed, a number that has fallen by about $300 billion during the balance sheet runoff. With regulations still demanding high cash levels for the nation's biggest banks, Crandall estimated that level of reserves won't dip much below $1.5 trillion. That's a little more conservative than Cabana's projection that banks won't want to see excess reserves, which peaked at $2.2 trillion, depleted by more than $1 trillion total. In balance sheet terms, Crandall's estimate implies a level of about $3.7 trillion \u2014 or half a trillion below current levels, he said. By October, the Fed will be allowing $50 billion a month to roll off, meaning that the balance sheet reduction could be finished by later summer or early fall 2019. Closing the roll-off program earlier than expected would be consistent with a growing sense at the Fed that it is nearing the end of this rate-hiking cycle. The policymaking FOMC has hiked the benchmark rate six times starting in December 2015, and is indicating two more hikes this year and three the next. However, with inflation remaining muted, some members believe the funds rate won't need to go much farther. The balance sheet rundown will be done \"by the middle of next year,\" Crandall said. \"That's optimistic on my part, but I don't think that's unrealistic.\" ", "author": "Aaron P.

Pershing Square Holdings' 10.3 percent net return last month was its second-best month since 2014, while its 7.5 percent gain through June 5 was notably higher than the broader market's 3 percent climb over the same time. Pershing's latest moves include stakes in United Technologies and Lowe's, both of which have outperformed the S&P 500 in the past month. News of Ackman's $1 billion investment in Lowe's helped spark another rally in the company's shares, which are now up 18 percent in the past 30 days. Pershing's stake in the home improvement retailer joins that of D.E. Shaw, which has already wrestled three board seats and overseen the forthcoming retirement of chief executive Robert Niblock. show chapters Bill Ackman takes $1B stake in Lowes: Dow Jones 1:03 PM ET Wed, 23 May 2018 | 04:17 Another bright spot for Pershing this year has been Chipotle, a company Ackman has heralded as a comeback in the works. The stock is up 56 percent this year, buoyed higher after former Taco Bell chief executive Brian Niccol agreed to lead the struggling burrito chain in February. Pershing Square declined to comment for this story. The performance data were reported on the publicly traded fund's website. \"Management intends to drive innovation across the business in customer access, digital, and menu, while focusing on fundamentals,\" Ackman wrote to investors in May. \"Near-term initiatives include a reallocation of marketing spend to more productive uses, implementation of a 'test and learn' approach for new products and other initiatives, extended hours, and use of marketing and innovation to convert current downtimes into transaction-driving opportunities.\" Though a now net gain for the fund, Ackman's roughly $1 billion stake in Chipotle has seen its fair share of volatility since the original 2016 investment. The company continues to climb its way out of a public relations headache after a series of E.coli outbreaks linked to store locations sent its stock price tumbling. Still, Pershing has plenty of work to do. The firm has seen its assets cut more than in half from their peak above $20 billion in 2015 as investors gradually fled lackluster returns. The fund posted a 4 percent decline in 2017 despite a largely steady march higher across the S&P 500. Total firm assets are $8.1 billion as of May 31. Several high-profile funds have disappointed in recent years, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which posted gains of just 1.6 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, last year.

Kano, known for its do-it-yourself computer building kits for kids, said that it had bagged the funding from Sesame Ventures, the social-minded venture arm of Sesame Workshop, to help it fuel growth and work on new products. The investment was part of a $28 million funding round Kano scored last year, however the companies did not disclose how much has been poured into the start-up in this latest injection of cash. Alex Klein, Kano's chief executive and co-founder, said on Friday that the firm's aim was to help children and people of all ages understand how the technology they use every day works, instead of just consuming it much in the way that people use platforms like Facebook and Netflix. \"We see dozens of hours of engagement, actually a level of engagement especially in the first month which rivals Snapchat,\" Klein told CNBC over the phone. \"What people are doing on Kano is not just using applications like Whatsapp or Wikipedia or Minecraft but remaking them and sharing their own versions of them.\" Kano The company doesn't just make DIY computer kits. And its products aren't just aimed at children. It has an online platform where users can create their own games and websites and motion sensor hardware that can be programmed to perform a range of tasks. \"Half of the users on our online platform which is free to use are over the age of 18,\" Klein said. Kano says it has sold more than 250,000 devices across 150 countries. It competes with computing firm Arduino, which also makes DIY computer building kits. Where next? Klein said that the latest capital would help Kano expand its product offering beyond computer building kits into new areas like the blockchain. \"You're going to see some product announcements from us in the next few months that will give you a sense of how we are evolving the creative computing system, both software and hardware\" he said. \"I think we're very well known for our computer kits which sell very well but the real value, as much as it is in the hardware, is in the software and the content.\" He added: \"We are also very keen to demystify decentralized networks like the blockchain. We feel that the original premise was build your own computer, learn to code, create the future.\" \"But what interests us greatly is building your own internet, learning how networks work so you can protect your data, so you can carefully and creatively open up access ports to other people, exchange files in your own way, kind of take some control back over how these core communication systems in your life work.\" Blockchain, the public network underpinning bitcoin, has influenced a wave of projects looking to create similar technology for purposes not just limited to finance. IBM, for instance, has invested a significant amount of money and resources into using blockchain technology for everything from food tracking to carbon credit trading. Tanya Haider, executive vice president for strategy, research and ventures at Sesame Workshop, said that the firm's venture capital unit was investing in companies like Kano to harness forms of children's entertainment and education that go beyond the reach of traditional media. \"We can have a much greater impact by partnering with others rather than doing everything ourselves,\" Haider told CNBC. \"'Sesame Street' was the original disrupter in kid's media by harnessing the power of television to teach. With Kano, we will be exploring the creation of products, content, and research that positively impact the way parents and children approach technology.\" It's not the first investment Sesame Workshop's little known venture fund has made in a start-up. Two years ago it invested in Yup, a science and math tutoring app, and Reach Capital, a venture capital firm focused on education. Sesame Ventures was set up by Sesame Workshop in 2016. Haider said it has used profits made through the sale of two of its networks, \"Noggin\" and \"Sprout,\" to fund new start-up investments.

Sure, some people plan to spend their retirement in a new country, or even at sea. The vast majority of Americans, though, plan to age in place. Three-quarters of those who are ages 50 to 64 say they want to spend their golden years in the same spot they spent their previous years. And that share swells to 87 percent for those 65 and older. Staying put in some places is going to better for your retirement than in other places, though.

The city also scored an 83 percent activity rate. Housing expenses come in at around $1,236 a month, and costs for goods and services are below the nation's average.

A bullish call from a Wall Street analyst capped off a rough week for Tesla short sellers, with Nomura Instinet advising clients that the electric car maker's shares could rally 42 percent over the next year. The stock rose 1.7 percent Friday and is now up 10 percent on the week. One of the most shorted stocks in the United States, Tesla shares cost investors betting against the company more than $1 billion in losses on Wednesday alone after the stock rallied 9.7 percent. Adding to the short woes, the stock is up 13.5 percent in June and up 21 percent since April. show chapters The bull vs. bear debate on Tesla 5:12 PM ET Thu, 7 June 2018 | 04:27 More than 30 percent of Tesla's floating stock is currently sold short, according to FactSet. \"We believe Model 3 average selling prices are coming in above forecast due to stronger-than-expected demand for all-wheel-drive and performance configurations,\" analyst Romit Shah told clients. \"We also anticipate cost leverage as Tesla scales to higher levels of production.\" Shah said early generations of Tesla's \"first production\" long-range battery costs typically fell in the $50,000 range, or nearly breakeven for the Palo Alto, California-based automaker. However, as the company scales to higher levels of production and ramps its efficiency, the costs for the same long-range battery should decline by as much as 20 percent. Citing the better outlook, that analyst raised his price target to $450 from $420, implying 42 percent upside over the next 12 months. He also adjusted his earnings per share estimates, predicting a year-end loss of $5.25 versus consensus forecasts of a $6.85 loss. Growing demand for its sport utility Model X is also driving up the average selling price of its cars, widening margins further. But Tesla's biggest opportunity, Shah wrote, lies in Chief Executive Elon Musk's move to China. Robin Ren, Tesla's head of worldwide sales, announced Tuesday that it plans to build its first factory outside of the U.S. in Shanghai. The announcement followed the Chinese government's decision to allow foreign electric vehicle makers to fully own auto factories there. \"China is arguably Tesla's most important regional market going forward. The company reported over $2 billion in sales in the China region in 2017, which we estimate equated to 15,000- 20,000 vehicles,\" Shah added. \"This is despite the 25 percent import tariff levied on international original equipment manufacturers lacking domestic joint venture partners.

The current \"character and attitude of the marketplace\" are similar to the belief then that \"tech can't lose,\" said the chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. \"What I find interesting, is that there's been significant narrowing of participation in the S&P 500 as these FANG stocks have really taken over,\" Paulsen said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" In 2013, Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" popularized the term FANG, which stands for shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, now part of Alphabet. More recently, another \"A\" was added to FAANG, representing Apple, and there's been talk about how to incorporate an \"M\" for Microsoft. Excluding tech stocks, the rest of the S&P has consistently, since 2013, been underperforming, compared with the overall market, Paulsen said. \"You could argue the contemporary fascination with technology stocks has just completed an entire dotcom cycle,\" Paulsen wrote in a note to clients. \"That is, for five years, tech has dominated the S&P marketplace which is surprisingly close to how long tech dominated during the dotcom run in the 1990s.\" \"I just wonder if it might end similarly,\" Paulsen told CNBC Friday. \"Not to the same magnitude, but similarly.\" The \"dotcom bubble\" from about 1995 to 2000, was a time of rapid grow in the equity market fueled by internet company investments. The bottom fell out in March 2000, which saw the Nasdaq, a index of with lots of tech stocks, lose nearly 80 percent of its value by October 2002. Larry Haverty, managing director at LIH Investment Advisors, said there are \"a lot of warning signs\" in the market right now, such as increased regulatory scrutiny in the tech sector. \"Eventually the law of large numbers is going to get [the FANG stocks],\" Haverty said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"With Amazon, I think the demon is antitrust.\" But Paulsen pointed out a clear distinction between today's technology sector and the 1990s is the Russell 2000. Within the small-cap index, he said, tech stocks are matching overall market performance, \"rather than significantly outperforming it.\" He added, \"Unlike the dotcom in the late 90s, where both small-cap and large-cap stocks were far outperforming the average stock, that's not happening in the small cap universe.\" If investors want to maintain a technology weight in their portfolios, Paulsen said, \"Do it in small- and mid-cap stocks as opposed to the popular FAANG names.\" Disclaimer Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

Jones told CNBCthat the new ETF could one day rival the benchmark U.S. stock index. The billionaire investor also predicted a stock market rally near the end of this year. \"I think we'll see rates move significantly higher beginning some time late third quarter, early fourth quarter,\" Jones said. \"And I think the stock market also has the ability to go a lot higher at the end of the year.\" He also said the Fed is well behind the curve when it comes to setting interest rates.

Knauf is USG's second-largest shareholder. Chicago-based USG makes building materials such as drywall.

But when the mortgage crisis hit, it needed a $300 million bailout from Berkshire in a deal that gave Buffett's conglomerate the chance to convert notes into shares. In March, Berkshire said in a securities filing it offered its stake in USG to Knauf for $42 a share. The deal, announced Monday, values Berkshire's stake at $1.9 billion. At last year's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called the investment \"disappointing.\" And last month, Buffett told CNBC it was the first time he can remember Berkshire voting against a director slate at one of its holdings. He said the directors \"didn't represent our interests\" about the decision to take that stance. \"For 18 years, it has not worked out that well,\" he said.

The DoJ could still appeal, but assuming it doesn't, here's what happens next. AT&T AT&T will move quickly to complete its $85 billion deal for Time Warner. AT&T has said it intends to close less than a week after a deal is approved, allowing for a short process by the appeals court to order a stay. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes will transition out of his job, collecting millions on his way out as part of a change of control employment package. The Time Warner brand will go away, following last year's extinction of Time Warner Cable. Comcast Comcast plans to kick off a bidding war on Wednesday with Disney to buy some Twenty-First Century Fox assets, which include cable networks, 39 percent of British satellite TV provider Sky Plc and Indian media conglomerate Star, according to people familiar with the matter.

Comcast intends to bid about $60 billion in cash, topping Disney's $52 billion all-stock offer. Disney Disney will have to decide if it's willing to improve its offer for Fox.

Now, both companies could theoretically have some other options, such as selling to Verizon, Charter, or a combined Sprint/T-Mobile, down the road. Verizon Verizon now has a clear opening to buy a large content company to compete with AT&T. This could be CBS, Viacom (or a combined CBS-Viacom), Discovery or something else. But Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told CNBC last month that buying a large pay-TV company is \"not our strategy,\" and the naming of successor Hans Vestberg, currently Verizon's CTO, suggests the company is more concerned with rolling out 5G than copying AT&T. show chapters Verizon CEO: 5G is a lot closer than people think 11:06 AM ET Tue, 15 May 2018 | 02:45 Charter Charter will also have a clear path forward to buying a content company if it wants to go down that road. Charter may also find negotiations with Time Warner a bit more challenging if the government argument turned out to be correct and AT&T threatens to hold back Time Warner programming if it doesn't get higher programming fees. Discovery Liberty Media Chairman and Discovery shareholder John Malone has long speculated about rolling up smaller content companies and potentially combining them with a cable or wireless provider. He owns stakes in Discovery, Lionsgate and Charter, among other companies. An approved deal may push him further in the direction of mass consolidation among his assets, if not others. Sprint/T-Mobile Sprint and T-Mobile, which announced plans to merge in April, will likely argue that AT&T will get even bigger and stronger as a competitor as they try to persuade U.S. regulators to allow a merger. Deal approval could also lead to an acquisition of a content company several years from now, although integration hurdles and capital spending on a combined company's network would probably take precedence. show chapters T-Mobile and Sprint go from trash talk to $26 billion deal 10:02 AM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 00:27 Disclosure: CNBC is owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal unit.

Wells Fargo customers can no longer buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin on their credit cards, the company announced Monday. But they can still buy firearms. The San Francisco-based bank joined some of its Wall Street peers in banning the purchase of cryptocurrencies on credit cards and said its decision is \"in line with the overall industry.\" \"We will continue to evaluate the issue as the market evolves,\" Wells Fargo said in a statement. \"We're doing this in order to be consistent across the Wells Fargo enterprise due to the multiple risks associated with this volatile investment.\" J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup announced in February they would no longer let customers buy cryptocurrencies using credit cards, and like Wells Fargo cited credit risks and market volatility. Capital One Financial said it has decided to ban cryptocurrency purchases with its cards, and Discover Financial Services has effectively prohibited cryptocurrency purchases with its credit cards since 2015. After rallying more than 1,300 percent last year to almost $20,000 in December, bitcoin is down roughly 50 percent this year. The digital currency was trading near $6,720 as of 2:00 p.m. ET Monday after a 10 percent plunge over the weekend. Wells Fargo has gone the opposite way of some of those banks in its stance on restricting firearms purchases. In March, the bank's CEO defended that decision, citing customers' right to choose. \"I don't know if banks or credit card companies or any other financial institution should be the arbiter of what an American can buy,\" Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's CEO at the time, told the Charlotte Observer in March. \"I don't know if Americans, regardless of which side of the issue you might be on, on whether or not folks should own guns or which type they should purchase, do they really want their bank to be making that decision?\" John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said after its quarterly conference call with investors that the bank had no plans to end business relationships with gunmakers and such a move would require \"a legislative solution.\" Citigroup was the first Wall Street bank to take a stance on the divisive gun control debate five weeks after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The bank set restrictions on the sale of firearms to customers who are younger than 21 or have not passed a background check. Bank of America said in April it would no longer lend to gun-manufacturing companies that produce \"military style\" weapons for civilians after what Anne Finucane, the bank's vice chairman, called \"intense conversations\" about company values. J.P. Morgan Chase also said it has cut its exposure to the firearms industry. Business ties to gun manufacturers \"have come down significantly and are pretty limited,\" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said after first-quarter results.

He joins several others on CNBC's Market Strategist Survey, where his 2018 S&P 500 forecast of 2,900 fell short of the median year-end estimate of 3,000. His S&P 500 earnings per share prediction is $157. In addition to the call on the broader market, Deshpande issued an overweight rating on financial, health care and information technology stocks and an underweight rating on consumer discretionary and utilities stocks. \"Higher rates and Treasury recommendations (leading to roll-back of major regulatory/capital requirements) would reveal true earnings power of banks overshadowed by years of regulations and litigation,\" he added.

Despite the generally upbeat outlook, the strategist did comment on President Donald Trump's policies surrounding trade and the impact a potential trade war could have on markets. The Trump administration has pursued an aggressive tact on trade, often putting the president at odds with economic allies like Canada and the European Union through the use of tariffs. Trade tensions peaked over the weekend at the G-7 summit in Quebec, Canada, where the U.S. incumbent refused to endorse a declaration calling for a reduction of import taxes. tweet Trump cited \"massive\" Canadian tariffs among other reasons for his abstinence, arguing that such trade accords put the U.S. at a disadvantage. Still, Deshpande argued that the president's hardline stance may ultimately work to hamper gains in the U.S. stock market. \"The government and fiscal policies undertaken by the Trump administration and global policymakers have been both a blessing and a curse for U.S. equity markets,\" he wrote. \"Trade barriers \u2014 which were deployed by the Trump administration this year, have the potential to negatively impact growth.

Expectations for business expansion and reports of positive earnings trends hit record highs, while expectations for strong increases in real sales reached their highest since 1995. Reports of compensation increases also hit their highest in the history of the index. Small businesses account for about 40 percent of total hiring and are a good indicator on overall economic activity, Joseph Lavorgna, chief economist for Americas at Natixis, said in a note Tuesday. The percent of firms in the NFIB survey expecting higher real sales tends to lead GDP by one quarter, which indicates second quarter growth should pick up to at least 3 percent, Lavorgna said. Source: NFIB, BEA, Haver Analytics, Natixis The U.S. economy grew at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, according to the second estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce. \"Small business owners are continuing an 18-month streak of unprecedented optimism which is leading to more hiring and raising wages,\" NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. \"While they continue to face challenges in hiring qualified workers, they now have more resources to commit to attracting candidates.\" Overall, the small business optimism index's reading of 107.8 in May marked an increase of 3 points from the prior month and the second-highest level in the index's 45-year history. The record high hit in 1983 is just 0.2 points more at 108.0. \"The new tax code is returning money to the private sector where history makes clear it will be better invested than by a government bureaucracy,\" a commentary in the NFIB report said. \"Regulatory costs, as significant as taxes, are being reduced.\" Small business optimism index (1986-2018) Source: National Federation of Independent Business.

use your iPhone to mine cryptocurrencies 4:40 PM ET Mon, 11 June 2018 | 00:45 Tech giant Apple has updated its developer guidelines to explicitly ban \"mining\" cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The new rules restrict apps that drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources \u2014 all of which take place in bitcoin mining. \"Apps, including any third party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining,\" Apple said on its website. show chapters Apple: Don't use your iPhone to mine cryptocurrencies 4:40 PM ET Mon, 11 June 2018 | 00:45 It's unlikely someone could successfully \"mine\" bitcoin on an iPhone or iPad alone because of the amount of energy and computing power it takes. But Apple's move could pre-emptively stop future, less energy-intensive digital currencies from being mined on these devices or halt the pooling of multiple devices to accomplish it. Here's what Apple's website says: 2.4 Hardware Compatibility 2.4.2 Design your app to use power efficiently. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. Apps, including any third party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining. The guidelines include cryptocurrency but that language remained the same as an archived version of the site recorded in late May by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Apple's crypto-related guidelines were originally set in 2014 after the app store unlisted Coinbase and other cryptocurrency apps, citing an \"unresolved issue,\" according to Apple Insider, which first reported the guideline updates Monday. The report didn't say when Apple updated its policy, and the company did not return a CNBC request for comment. 3.1.5 (b) Cryptocurrencies: (i) Wallets: Apps may facilitate virtual currency storage, provided they are offered by developers enrolled as an organization. (ii) Mining: Apps may not mine for cryptocurrencies unless the processing is performed off device (e.g. cloud-based mining). (iii) Exchanges: Apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered by the exchange itself. (iv) Initial Coin Offerings: Apps facilitating Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\"), cryptocurrency futures trading, and other crypto-securities or quasi-securities trading must come from established banks, securities firms, futures commission merchants (\"FCM\"), or other approved financial institutions and must comply with all applicable law. (v) Cryptocurrency apps may not offer currency for completing tasks, such as downloading other apps, encouraging other users to download, posting to social networks, etc. Cryptocurrency \"mining\" is essentially math often done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what's known as a \"distributed ledger.\" In return for solving equations \"miners\" receive bitcoin. On a computer, that process generates 1,400 watts \u2014 the same as one hair dryer, according to bitcoin mining company Coinmint. Many apps on the iOS store claim to let users mine with power from their personal devices, including \"Crypto Coin Miner\" and \"Cryptocurrency Cloud Mining.\" The latter says it lets users \"make money and earn cryptocurrencies \"without major investment or hassle from direct involvement with hardware or software.\" Bitcoin hit its lowest in two months over the weekend after a relatively small South Korean exchange said it was hacked. The digital currency was trading near $6,726 Monday, according to CoinDesk.

The battle between China and the United States to be the world's most powerful nation could be the century's defining moment for financial markets, according to one strategist. Market players on Tuesday were digesting news of an accord between North Korea and the United States, which aims to work toward complete denuclearization and a lasting \"peace regime\" on the Korean Peninsula. The historic agreement is being scrutinized by analysts and traders to understand what this moment means to the world and financial markets. But according to Jane Foley, the head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, the wider picture should include China's relationship with the U.S. \"I think it's been very clear we've had this power struggle or are in the midst perhaps of a power struggle between the U.S. and China, played out, of course, through trade,\" Foley told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\" show chapters Trump: I had a very good meeting with G-7 5:20 AM ET Tue, 12 June 2018 | 09:24 \"We've previously understood that perhaps China have liked North Korea to be in place as a sort of a buffer between itself and the West, what does this (Tuesday's agreement) mean going forward?,\" Foley wondered. \"This power struggle \u2026 is perhaps the biggest event for the markets really, of the decade, maybe, probably of the century,\" she added.

As the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea gets closer, China could feel threatened and potentially change its attitude toward the U.S. \"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past.

For bitcoin traders, key times to buy or sell often come at the least opportune time to be behind a computer monitor: Saturday night. Some of the digital currency's steepest price swings have happened over a weekend. Bitcoin hit its all-time high near $20,000 on a Saturday in December, and dove to a recent two-month low this Sunday. Roughly 60 percent of weekends since December have seen a 5 percent or higher price move over a weekend, and 82 percent of weekends have had at least a 3 percent move in either direction, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Low liquidity, and limited bank hours have made it all the more challenging for U.S. traders to capitalize on these weekend price swings. Mark Newton is one analyst on-call during odd hours. The former Morgan Stanley technical strategist has notifications on his phone through the Coinbase trading app, and had been watching for alert when bitcoin hit $7,345 before he cut his losses. This Saturday, bitcoin fell, his Coinbase app lit up, and Newton clicked the sell button. \"Rule no. 1 is you don't pick losses, you don't sit there and try to defend a bad position \u2014 it's not emotional,\" said Newton, president and founder of Newton Advisors. \"We're seeing above average volatility on weekends with it moving dramatically up or down.\" if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":553,\"200\":527,\"300\":527,\"400\":500,\"500\":500,\"700\":500,\"800\":500,\"900\":500,\"1000\":500},window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-nFrMX\"),window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"nFrMX\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"nFrMX\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Newton works with hedge funds and other firms to provide crypto technical analysis. He gave clients the heads up Sunday that a key \"stop loss\" milestone had been triggered. It's possible bitcoin's price dive was accelerated by hitting that level, which forced a wave of selling by multiple traders, he said. Others attributed the 10 percent sell-off Sunday to news of a hack in South Korea and a Wall Street Journal report about U.S. regulators investigating potential price manipulation at exchanges. Over the weekend, world's largest and most valuable cryptocurrency plunged below to a two-month low of $6,647.33, according to CoinDesk. Low volume While the hack and Wall Street Journal report may have fired the starting gun, the major price drop happened later that afternoon. Volumes rose roughly 25 percent around in the early afternoon on the East Coast, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Around the same time, bitcoin prices dropped sharply. That pattern, according to eToro analyst Matthew Newton, could have been the result of a large sell order. \"That serious uptick in volume around 6 pm BST was when you saw that really violent move downward,\" said Matthew Newton, U.K.-based analyst at eToro. \"It certainly seems to have accelerated the drop.\" For bitcoin, 24-hour trading dollar volume has fallen by more than 60 percent this year after starting the year above $12 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. \"Whales,\" or holders of large amounts of bitcoin, have a massive influence in the market \u2014 and can be even more influential when trading volume is low on weekends. About 1600 wallets, or accounts, hold roughly 28 percent of that total bitcoin in existence, according to data from BitInfoCharts. One of these whales placing a large buy or sell order on weekend can have an especially drastic effect on an already \"thin\" market, eToro's Newton said. Bank hours One reason trading tends be be thinner on weekends is because most people don't have access to their bank accounts. Bitcoin trading happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week while banks are typically open 40 hours a week. When time is not a concern, people use bank transfers to purchase bitcoin and save on purchasing fees. Most cryptocurrency exchanges will charge about a 4 percent fee for card cryptocurrency purchases. Some exchanges like Coinbase and eToro support credit cards for deposits or withdraws in fiat currencies. But that's not an option on other exchanges like Gemini or Kraken. In order to fund your account with U.S. dollars on those exchanges, you have to link a bank account and initiate a Bank Transfer (ACH) deposit or wire transfer. Buying the dips, or making money off of these swings on a weekend requires using a debit card, or trading one cryptocurrency for another. That becomes tricky for some hedge funds, who are used to trading in and out of fiat currency. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-nJoej\"),window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"nJoej\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"nJoej\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital investment firm BKCM, said funds like his are often forced to take a position Friday before those banks close since he mostly trades in and out of U.S. dollars. \"For hedge fund managers, you often have to decide 'what do I wanna look like for the next two days,\" Kelly said. \"If I have 10 percent in cash in my fund and I want to buy that dip Sunday, I don't have much of a choice.\" In an emergency, Kelly might trade through over-the-counter, or OTC markets. But those marketplaces are only available to SEC-registered and FINRA-approved broker-dealers. With fewer traders able to access to their banks, weekends tend to be marked by low liquidity. Kelly highlighted that this gives a big trade, or any news events an exacerbated effect on the market. \"Over the weekend, there's not much new money coming in to support prices,\" Kelly said. \"It's a relatively thin market and news is exacerbated over the weekend when it's even thinner.\" Bitcoin is still searching for its footing after Sunday's $1,000 plunge and was trading near $6,745 Tuesday. The digital currency has dropped by roughly 50 percent this year, after its epic 1,300 rise in 2017.

Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, said Tuesday financial advisors still play a major role in the finance world \u2014 despite recent technological disruptions in the industry \u2014 as they act as therapists for investors. As an advisor, you have to find out \"what the client's needs are, what the client's capabilities are in terms of taking risks,\" as well as their dreams and fears, Kahneman, known for his work in behavioral economics, said in a keynote at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago. \"When bad things happen, you have to be there. [Clients] need to have a sense that there's someone that they trust and has their interests in mind and who knows what they want.\" In recent years, the financial industry has been disrupted by technological advances that have led to job losses as well as lower fees for advisors. One of the biggest disruptions has been the rise in so-called robo-advisors, which provide financial advice to investors with next to no human interaction and at a far lower price. Robo-advisors are also growing at a very fast rate, surpassing $200 billion in assets under management last year, according to BackEnd Benchmarking, which releases quarterly data on robo-advisors. Other major wealth management firms have developed their own internal versions of robo-advisors. Still, Kahneman said, \"There is a hand-holding function\" for advisors which is \"very important.\" Kahneman won the Nobel in 2002 for his work in behavioral economics. The Nobel laureate also said he is researching \"unsystematic errors,\" which refer to random mistakes made by individuals or a group of people. \"During my career, I've done a lot of work on systematic errors that people make,\" Kahneman said. \"In recent years, I've become more convinced that there is something more important than systematic error. That's unsystematic error. We call that noise.\" Kahneman gave an example of two insurance underwriters presented with the same case in a study to illustrate his point. In theory, there should be about a 10 percent difference between the two estimates provided by the underwriters. However, that difference totaled 50 percent. \"There's a lot of noise when making a decision. Not in the decision itself, but in the making of the decision,\" he said. \"It is possible that an algorithm, and even an unsophisticated algorithm, will do better because the main characteristic of algorithms is they're noise-free. You give them the same problem twice, you get the same result. People don't.\" ", "author": "Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/kahneman-human-advisors-are-still-crucial-even-with-the-rise-of-robo-advisors.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Zhang Peng", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Robots", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Beijing China National Convention Center", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jul. 8, 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Beijing", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Daniel Kahneman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a Nobel Prize", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kahneman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Morningstar Investment Conference", "category": "EVENT"}, {"term": "Chicago", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "recent years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "One", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "$200 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "BackEnd Benchmarking", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kahneman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kahneman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Nobel", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "2002", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Nobel", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Kahneman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "recent years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kahneman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}], "description": "Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman says financial advisors still play a major role in the finance world \u2014 despite recent technological disruptions in the industry.", "title": "Nobel laureate Kahneman says human financial advisors are still crucial, even with the rise of robo-advisors", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/23/104859565-GettyImages-811545940.jpg?v=1527276204"}, {"time": "2018-06-12T07:36:55-0400", "body": " show chapters Bitcoin has not bottomed yet, says CNBC's Ran Neu Ner 6:39 PM ET Mon, 11 June 2018 | 07:40 The price of bitcoin may sink even lower, cryptocurrency trader Ran Neu-Ner says. \"We keep going down, and we're testing new lows,\" Neu-Ner said Monday of the cryptocurrency market on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\" \"Sixty-two-fifty is the next point,\" said Neu-Ner, who is host of CNBC Africa's \"Crypto Trader.\" \"If it goes under that, we're going to test 5,900.\" Neu-Ner said a key level for investors to watch was $5,000. \"That's where the miners look at this and go, 'Is it actually worth keeping the machine on?\"' said Neu-Ner, founder of OnChain Capita. \"At about $5,000, if we don't get a turn up, then we may see a very different game in mining.\" Bitcoin fell below $7,000 on Sunday, plunging to $6,647.33.

Mainland Chinese stocks led Asian market gains on Tuesday after the highly anticipated meeting in Singapore of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Both signed an agreement that reaffirmed \"unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" But the document offered few details. The Shanghai composite climbed 0.9 percent in its best day since May 31. The index reached its highest level in two days. The Hang Seng rose 0.1 percent. The iShares China large-cap ETF (FXI), which tracks stocks of large Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong, has climbed an average 0.9 percent in the two trading days after talks between leaders of North and South Korea that indicated improved relations, according to CNBC analysis using quantitative analytics tool Kensho. The majority of North Korea's trade is with China, which supplies most of the rogue state's oil. The close relationship between the two also makes China an important part of U.S. efforts to put pressure on North Korea. However, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have increased in the last few months. \"President Xi [Jinping] of China ... has really closed up that border, maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's OK,\" Trump said during a press conference shortly after 4 a.m. ET. Trump added he would likely call Xi \"very shortly\" about the summit with Kim. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up a third of a percent at 22,878.35, after briefly touching its highest level since May 22. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) was unchanged in premarket trading. South Korea's Kospi spiked 0.38 percent to its highest level since May 29, but erased those gains to close 0.05 percent lower. The iShares MSCI South Korea Capped ETF (EWY) is down 1.5 percent this year amid uncertainty in North Korea tensions. The ETF was unchanged in premarket trading. \"We will be stopping the war games, unless and until we see that the future negotiation is not going along like it should,\" Trump said. \"But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus I think it's very provocative.\" However, Trump said the U.S. will not reduce military capability in the region. North Korea would like the U.S. to remove its troops from South Korea, and made threats around U.S.-South Korea annual joint military exercises. European stocks traded little changed as of 4:58 a.m. ET. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat to mildly lower open. \u2014 CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.

The rate is closely tied to consumer debt, particularly credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other adjustable-rate instruments. In an unusually terse statement that ran just 320 words, the Federal Open Market Committee changed multiple phrases from its previous missives, pointing to a more optimistic view on economic growth and higher inflation expectations.

The unemployment rate has \"declined,\" as opposed to \"stayed low,\" and household spending \"has picked up,\" an upgrade from \"moderated.\" With that in mind, the committee said two more rate hikes were appropriate, bringing the 2018 total to four increases. Its first hike this year was in March. \"The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,\" the statement said. That sentence itself featured multiple instances of more hawkish language. The committee previously had characterized rate hikes as \"gradual adjustments\" rather than \"increases,\" and the \"sustained expansion\" portion was completely new. However, the statement twice retained language that the Fed had a \"symmetric\" 2 percent inflation target, indicating a tendency to let price pressures run a little hot before putting the clamps on growth. show chapters Fed's Powell: We'll always be using our tools to move inflation toward target 3:11 PM ET Wed, 13 June 2018 | 02:33 With the 0.25 percentage point increase already priced in, financial markets were looking for how aggressive the FOMC would be in setting monetary policy for the rest of the year. Markets had been waffling over expectations for a fourth rate hike this year \u2014 the FOMC also increased the funds rate target in March \u2014 and prior to the meeting were pricing in a 46.5 percent chance. The latest projections from committee members indicate the funds rate to rise to 2.4 percent by the end of the year, a 0.3 percentage point increase from the March forecast. Stocks edged lower after the FOMC release while government bond yields nudged higher. \"They telegraphed it. The only incremental surprise is just that the now expect four rate hikes, and I suppose that's why the market is a little weaker on that news,\" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. That accelerates the move from the Fed's being neutral to more restrictive.\" Economic forecast Committee members indicated in the update to their quarterly economic forecast that they expected core inflation to reach the Fed's 2 percent target by the end of the year, and now see economic growth hitting 2.8 percent for the full year. Both the expectations for gross domestic product and personal consumption reflected a 0.1 percentage point increase from the last estimates in March and were enough to push the so-called dot plot of individual committee member rate expectations to a more aggressive position. Three committee members moved their expectations higher for rates. show chapters Fed's Powell: 'We're waiting and seeing' on sustained 3% growth 3:06 PM ET Wed, 13 June 2018 | 01:32 In addition to the upward projections for GDP and inflation, committee members also cut their forecast for unemployment. They now see a 3.6 percent rate by year's end, compared with the current 3.8 percent, which was the full-year projection in March. The committee also indicated it continues to expect three more rate hikes in 2019, even with the fourth one this year. Despite the added hike, officials still see the long-run funds rate at 2.9 percent after peaking at 3.4 percent in 2020. The extra hike, though, pushes the rate past \"neutral\" in 2019, a little sooner than anticipated. They still see GDP rising 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2 percent the year after, and longer-range growth at 1.8 percent. The headline inflation forecast, which includes food and energy, rose one-tenth of a point to 2.1 percent in 2019 and stayed at that level for the following year. Headline inflation projections also stayed at 2.1 percent for 2019 and 2020.

Bank headquarters in Dallas, Texas. When the first quarter reports about bank loans became available, there was a big surprise. The biggest banks in the country were losing market share to their smaller competitors. In the 12-month period from March 2017 to March 2018, the four big universal banks grew their loan portfolios by 3.1 percent. Conversely, the 39 mid-cap regionals grew their loans by 15.7 percent, and 56 community banks grew their lending by 14.7 percent. Savvy investors took notice. Through June 8, shares of the big universal banks fell 1.6 percent, while the mid-cap regional bank stocks were up 7.8 percent and the community banks stocks were up 12.1 percent. The big banks may be losing touch with their customers due to the excessive use of \"hi-tech\" banking, while the smaller banks have continued to follow a policy of \"hi-touch\" service. The FDIC tells us that from the financial crisis in 2008 to 2017 banks net closed 3,900 branches, or about 5 percent of the total in this country. Virtually all of these closures were being done at the big bank level. The big banks made two decisions. The first was that operating costs were much too high. The second was that their millennial consumers did not want to do business at bank branches. They wanted banking services on their mobile phones. The big banks, therefore, complied with what they thought were consumer preferences and signed up tens of millions of mobile banking customers. The small banks did not have the money to implement advanced technology. They bought some products from third party fintech companies, but in the main they did business through their branch systems. For a period, it appeared that the big banks had made the right decision. Their operating costs fell in absolute terms in many cases. Plus, consumer banking was soaring due to the increase in employment. Credit card loans rose more than 8.5 percent annually in 2016 and auto loans were up even more than that. At the same time, loans to businesses were plummeting. By mid-2017 business loan growth at the big banks was down to 0.5 percent year-over-year from what had been over 10 percent. The nature of loans being sold is important here. This is because consumer loans are handled primarily by computers. They are the essence of hi-tech banking. Business loans are handled by people. They require hi-touch service. The pro-business actions taken by the new president and Congress changed the rules of the game. Taxes were cut, health care requirements for small businesses were changed, lending regulations were eased and there was a hint of change in infrastructure building and tariffs. Ultimately, even Congress got involved easing the lending pressure on small banks by lifting more regulations. The result is that the nation's small businesses began to expand. Year-over-year, lending jumped from 0.5 percent to 3.6 percent and it is still growing. Meanwhile, consumer lending began to top out. It dropped to below 8 percent on credit cards and to 2.5 percent year-over-year on autos. Moreover, losses were beginning to mount in both of these consumer areas while they stayed at record lows on business loans. This shift in the market is what caused small and middle market bank loans to rise at much faster rates than big bank loans. Small businesses require help from people at branches, and they are receiving it from small banks. Big banks are now scrambling in some cases to open new branches in new markets to get at the \"action\" in the business loan market. It is not well\u2013recognized by most investors, but banks are the same as any other company. They need to sell something to push revenue and earnings higher. That something is loans. Right now the \"edge\" here is to the smaller regional and community banks. This edge is going to get much bigger. The growth in small and middle market companies is beginning. Their need for banking services is growing. Small banks have been deregulated to a great extent, so they can capture the new growth. For investors the answer is clear. The gains in bank stocks are to be found where the banks are selling products. This is in the mid-cap banks not the giants. Today and, in my view, for the next few years, mid-cap bank stocks are where money should be invested in banking.

Bernstein | Reuters Jerome Powell looks on after a swearing-in ceremony February 5, 2018 at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC. Markets increased their expectations for a fourth interest rate hike this year after the Federal Reserve released its statement and economic projections on Wednesday. Fed funds futures showed the odds for a hike in December, which would follow one likely in September, rose to 58 percent, according to traders. That's up from around 50 percent odds the futures prices reflected prior to the afternoon release of the Fed's statement and economic projections. On Wednesday, the central bank raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points for the second time this year, up to a 1.75 percent to 2 percent range. The median forecast in the \"dot plot\" of policymaker expectations for interest rates this year rose to 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, up from a previous median projection of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. The increase indicates two more interest rate hikes are likely this year. That said, the change in the median forecast from the \"dot plot\" was the result of an increase by one Fed member's estimates to 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. \"It's not fully priced for the second [additional] hike yet,\" said Lee Ferridge, North American head of macro strategy for State Street Global Markets. \"It's a pretty rosy picture [Fed Chair Jerome Powell has] given right now, so maybe this is the peak. It has that potential.\" Treasury yields rose after the Fed statement release, with the rate-sensitive 2-year yield climbing to its highest since 2008. The 10-year yield briefly hit 3 percent but was off that level and trading near 2.98 percent Wednesday afternoon.

killing the planet and needs to change, says investor Jeremy Grantham 11:06 AM ET Wed, 13 June 2018 | 01:00 Jeremy Grantham, the longtime investor famous for calling the last two major bubbles in the market, is urging capitalists and \"mainstream economists\" to recognize the looming threat of climate change. \"Capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems. Mainstream economics largely ignore [them],\" Grantham, who co-founded GMO in 1977, said Tuesday in an impassioned speech at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago. \"We deforest the land, we degrade our soils, we pollute and overuse our water and we treat air like an open sewer, and we do it all off the balance sheet.\" This negligence is due in large part to how short-sighted corporations can be, Grantham said. \"Anything that happens to a corporation over 25 years out doesn't exist for them, therefore, as I like to say, grandchildren have no value\" to them, he said. Getty Images 2016 is likely to have been the hottest year since global temperatures were recorded in the 19th century. Grantham has been outspoken about his concerns over climate change for years. In 1997, he started the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, which gives money to entities that look to protect the environment. Grantham's company also launched the GMO Climate Change fund last year, which invests in wind and solar companies. Throughout his presentation, Grantham cited a slew of data showing how climate change is impacting soil, grains, temperature as well as general human health. Those numbers, coupled with Grantham's speech delivery, scared a lot of people in attendance at the conference. Grantham also pointed out that many of the problems with how capitalists deal with climate change stem from the very nature of corporations. \"A corporation's responsibility is to maximize profit, not to spend money and figure out how to save the planet,\" he said. But Grantham added: \"We're racing to protect much more than our portfolios. \u2026 We're racing to protect our grandchildren and our species, so get to it.\" Grantham correctly called the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 as well as the sharp market downturn in 2008. These calls helped solidify his reputation in the investment world as a legendary investor. However, Grantham's GMO has taken massive hits in recent years. The firm's assets under management have dropped to $71 billion in March from about $124 billion in June 2014 following big bets on emerging markets.

Bitcoin dropped 5 percent, to its lowest level since February, following reports of price manipulation Wednesday. The digital currency fell to a low of $6,133.31 as of 1 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinDesk. Bitcoin has lost half its value this year after skyrocketing to almost $20,000 in December. Prices began stumbling after a study was released by the University of Texas saying at least half of bitcoin's rise last year was due to price manipulation on popular exchange Bitfinex. The 66-page paper said another cryptocurrency called tether was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining, which helped \"stabilize and manipulate\" the cryptocurrency's price. Bitcoin has fallen more than 18 percent in the past week, struggling to regain footing after dropping below $6,700 Sunday. News of a hack at a relatively small South Korean exchange seemed to have triggered some of the weekend losses, but some traders said selling was also exacerbated by investors hitting \"stop losses,\" selling their bitcoins when they reached a certain price. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":486,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-1xFpV\"),window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"1xFpV\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); This break below $6,450 confirms bitcoin's downtrend, according to one Fundstrat analyst. \"The declines over the past few days [have] done significant technical damage to most crypto currency charts,\" Robert Sluymer, managing director and technical analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"Breaking below the April lows confirms a longer-term downtrend for BTC by establishing the first lower since the uptrend began in 2015.\" The next support level is near $5,500, Sluymer said. If the current correction, which he said is a \"big IF,\" matched the 2014 bear market, bitcoin could see an additional 50 percent drop to the next support level of $3,200. Despite precipitous declines in 2018, the cryptocurrency has still tripled in value since last summer. \"Bitcoin's decline this year appears to be gathering steam, but it's important to note that the spot price is still up over 140% from this date 12 months ago,\" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital. \"When compared against the meteoric 1400% increase seen overall in 2017, the gain isn't quite as dramatic but still outperforming many other asset classes.\" DiPasquale's research indicates a bottom around $5,000 is possible before any recovery for bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies fell alongside bitcoin Wednesday. Ethereum, XRP and litecoin all dropped 7 percent, while bitcoin cash was down 5 percent.

On CNBC's \"Futures Now,\" Doty predicted the 10-year Treasury yield won't stay under 3 percent much longer. \"It's going to be kind of turbulent,\" the senior portfolio manager said Tuesday. \"I'm still expecting some more white-knuckle moments.\" Doty closely follows rising rates because he runs the firm's Rise ETF, which is designed to profit from them. According to Morningstar, the ETF is up 3 percent this year. His thoughts came as June's two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates got underway. Doty believes the Fed, as expected, will hike rates by a quarter point on Wednesday. He sees yields going nowhere but higher as the central bank sticks with its tightening policy. \"We keep making new highs every time the yield spikes on the 10-year. I just think that's going to continue,\" said Doty, whose firm has $14 billion in assets under management. After hitting a four-year high of 3.003 percent on April 24, 10-year yields softened and are now trading around 2.9 percent. They began the year at a benign 2.4 percent. \"I think the 10-year note at the end of the year is going to be between 3.5 and 4,\" he said. \"It's probably not until 3.5 percent on the 10-year where it really starts to hurt the economy.\" He's predicting that housing, in particular, could soon get caught in the crosshairs. \"If mortgage rates get up over 5, 5.5 percent, that really starts to hit the real estate market.

A study published Wednesday says at least half of the jump in bitcoin was due to coordinated price manipulation. University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, who has a 10-year track record of spotting financial fraud, and graduate student Amin Shams examined millions of transactions on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In a 66-page paper, the authors found that tether was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining, which helped \"stabilize and manipulate\" the cryptocurrency's price. \"Fraud and manipulation often leave footprints in the data and it's nice to have the blockchain to track things,\" Griffin told CNBC. By tracking Bitfinex transactions, which are recorded on a public ledger, Griffin found that another cryptocurrency, tether. was used to buy bitcoin after large price falls. The authors tracked that pattern and found periods of suspicious bitcoin price activity tied to the issuance of tether, which is purportedly pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. \"It was creating price support for bitcoin, and over the period that we examined, had huge price effects,\" Griffin said. \"Our research would indicate that there are sophisticated people harnessing investor interest for their benefit.\" Griffin found that about 87 hours, or about 1 percent, of heavy tether trading could explain 50 percent of the rise of bitcoin, and around 64 percent of the rise of other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose to almost $20,000 in December after starting last year below $1,000. This year, the world's first and most popular cryptocurrency has lost more than half its value, trading near $6,252 on Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinDesk. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":486,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-1xFpV\"),window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"1xFpV\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"1xFpV\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Both Bitfinex and Tether, the company that issues the virtual currency, have been a cause of concern for some in the industry. \"The lack of transparency surrounding Tether raises red flags for me,\" said Dan Ciotoli, software engineer and blockchain analyst at Bespoke Investment Group. \"It's probable that Tether issuance made significant contributions to artificially high bitcoin prices seen last year.\" Others have voiced concern that Tether doesn't actually hold enough U.S. dollars to back all of its digital coins in circulation. In December, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent a subpoena to Bitfinex and Tether. In 2016, the CFTC fined Bitfinex $75,000 for failing to register with the agency and offering \"illegal\" cryptocurrency transactions. A few months later, hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins from the Caribbean-based exchange. Bitfinex is one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms in the world by trading volume, and while it is registered in the Caribbean and owned by a British Virgin Islands company, it also has offices in Asia and Europe. Bitfinex CEO J.L. van der Velde told CNBC in an email that \"Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation.\" \"Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex,\" van der Velde said. Tether did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Griffin has spent the past decade publishing research on fraud by credit agencies, mortgage fraud by banks, to most recently manipulation of a volatility index known as the VIX. For the time being, he's turning his attention to the cryptocurrency market, which Griffin said has \"not a lot of monitoring going on.\" \"In general I research things that are potentially illegal, and there's a lot of rumors surrounding potential questionable activity in cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"That's why it's useful to see what the data says \u2014 data speaks.\" ", "author": "Chesnot | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/much-of-bitcoins-2017-boom-was-market-manipulation-researcher-says.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Chesnot | Getty Images Bitcoin's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "at least half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "University of Texas", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "John Griffin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "10-year", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Amin Shams", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "millions", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "66-page", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Fraud", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "about 87 hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "about 1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "around 64 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "almost $20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "This year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "more than half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "6,252", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "afternoon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Dan Ciotoli", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bespoke Investment Group", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CFTC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "75,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "A few months later", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "119,756", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Caribbean", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Caribbean", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "British Virgin Islands", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Asia", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "J.L. van der", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bitfinex", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "van der Velde", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "the past decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "VIX", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Griffin", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "New research argues that at least half of the jump in bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices was due to a coordinated price manipulation campaign.", "title": "Much of bitcoin's 2017 boom was market manipulation, research says", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/14/104899288-GettyImages-882963066.jpg?v=1513273518"}, {"time": "2018-06-13T18:35:45-0400", "body": " Scott Mlyn | CNBC Jim Chanos In Silicon Valley, hyperbole is becoming a problem, according to prominent short-seller Jim Chanos.

You can't lie to investors\" Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" Wednesday. \"You're going to see an increase of these kinds of revelations as time goes on, particularly out in Silicon Valley.\" Chanos, who teaches a course on the history of financial fraud at Yale University, said the field is \"fertile\" for companies like Theranos to mislead investors, especially in a bull market. \"People's sense of disbelief is reduced and they begin to believe things that are too good to be true, and bad people take advantage of that,\" said Chanos, whose firm has more than $2 billion in assets under management spread across a short-only fund and a hedge fund. show chapters Chanos: China happy to take up any leadership mantle the US gives up 4:31 PM ET Wed, 13 June 2018 | 09:55 Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes was charged with fraud in March after raising more than $700 million while deceiving investors.The start-up made it appear as if it had successfully developed a commercially-ready portable blood analyzer when the technology could only perform a fraction of the tests advertised. Holmes settled civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March. As part of the agreement, she returned millions of shares to the privately held company, paid a $500,000 fine and cannot serve as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. Chanos pointed to an overall lack of due diligence by both the boards and investors in believing CEOs like Holmes. He also said the Silicon Valley \"willingness to sort of say anything by CEOs\" is an issue at Tesla, a company he is betting against. Chanos called shares of the electric car maker \"overvalued\" and said its CEO Elon Musk's predictions are based on \"futuristic hype.\" \"The fact of the matter the company is not profitable from operations,\" Chanos said. \"It's about the future and keeping investors focused on some point in the future when they think the company might be profitable.\" He criticized Musk for not seeing \"the immediate future\" when it came to layoffs. Tesla told employees Tuesday it will cut about 9 percent of its workforce. A Tesla representative wasn't immediately available.

President Donald Trump is again blaming OPEC for high oil prices, even though crude futures have recently retreated from 3\u00bd-year highs on reports that his administration asked Saudi Arabia to manage the market. \"Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!\" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. U.S. crude oil futures were trading near $66 a barrel on Wednesday and have been fallen about 9.5 percent from a multiyear high of nearly $73 a barrel on May 22. Oil prices fell this month on reports that the Trump administration asked Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, to start pumping more as renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran begin to hit the country's exports. Tweet Trump restored sanctions on Iran, OPEC's No. 3 producer, last month. The severity of the penalties helped to boost oil prices to new highs. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin assured reporters at one point that Washington had discussed limiting the impact of Iranian disruptions with other producers. Crude futures began slipping in late May after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were considering easing an agreement to limit output among two dozen oil producers in light of the U.S. sanctions on Iran and falling output in Venezuela, which has also been sanctioned by Trump's administration. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, Iran's OPEC governor, suggested on Wednesday that Trump was glossing over his role in contributing to higher prices. \"You cannot place sanctions on two OPEC founder members and still blame OPEC for oil price volatility,\" he told Reuters. Oil prices are also lower than the last time Trump tweeted about high oil prices. On April 20, Trump tweeted that \"oil prices are artificially Very High\" due to actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. WTI oil prices traded near $68 at the time, after hitting a then-three-year high above $69 a barrel that week. Prices are up more than 40 percent in the last 12 months. In 2017, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, started withholding output in an effort to curb global oversupply. OPEC and other producers are set to meet on June 22-23 in Vienna to discuss future policy on production. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia reported that its oil output jumped by 161,000 barrels per day in May to more than 10 million bpd, just below the ceiling it agreed to in November 2016. In oil markets, the Energy Information Administration is set to release domestic production and inventory data later Wednesday. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

Investors just need to be patient for his trade to work out, he told CNBC on Wednesday. On May 29, the portfolio manager's Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund had its worst day since its 2014 launch, falling nearly 3 percent. That's when Italian political concerns caused volatility in the bond market. Gross conceded the fund's performance has been more volatile than usual. \"All of the bad trade numbers on that one particular day have been made up. The fund is up 2.5 percent over the past several weeks,\" he said on \"Power Lunch.\" Lucy Nicholson | Reuters Bill Gross' Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund suffered more than $200 million in redemptions last month, lowering assets to $1.25 billion from over $2.24 billion in February. He's still banking on what he's calling the \"trade of the year,\" which is a bet that German bond prices will fall while U.S. Treasurys will rise. The 10-year German bund yield is nearly 0.50 percent, while the 10-year Treasury yield is close to 3 percent right now, he pointed out. Bond yields move inversely to prices. \"One of these days, and hopefully soon, that difference has got to be narrowed,\" he said. \"In the meantime, there's some volatility as the bund does better based upon weakness in Italy ... or as Treasury [yields] go up based on upon a Fed decision.\" Meanwhile, Gross' bond fund posted $300 million in withdrawals in the month of May, data from research service Morningstar showed Tuesday. The fund had assets of $2.1 billion at the end of April. \"Investing requires patience,\" Gross said. \"This is a trade that will work out.\" \u2014 CNBC's Tae Kim and Reuters contributed to this report.

A decade later, Karani is a director at Barclays in New York where she trades health-care derivatives and helps the bank's effort to attract more women to trading by talking to female college students about her job. Despite such efforts Karani still represents a small minority since few women apply for jobs in trading, deterred by its decades-old reputation as an \"alpha-male territory\" and misconceptions about skills it requires. \"Trading is a hard one to crack,\" said Jon Regan, a head of global markets for executive search firm Sheffield Haworth. \"I don't think it has changed much, although firms are working hard to improve their gender ratios.\" The firm, which works for many leading investment banks and conducts studies on behalf of its clients, found women generally account for 12 to 15 percent of trading roles, he said. There are no industry-wide data but the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees U.S. brokerages, said women accounted for about 28 percent of individuals registered with it at the end of 2017. Those numbers include not just traders, but also investment advisers. Banks' efforts to change that have intensified over the past year with the emergence of the #MeToo movement and growing shareholder calls for disclosures on workforce diversity. For example, Citigroup and Bank of America released information on diversity and gender pay gap for the first time this year in response to calls from an investment advisory firm. Since last year, major employers have also been obliged to report gender pay gap data for their British operations, which for banks showed women underrepresented in higher earning roles. Coaching, networking, and mentoring Barclays' Sophomore Springboard program that Karani supports is one of several initiatives banks have introduced recently to make trading rooms more diverse. Citigroup does college recruitment focused on informing young women about trading careers and offers them interview coaching, while JPMorgan Chase has been running an internal program for the past two years called Women Who Trade, which offers networking for female traders of all levels, including potential recruits. \"We are doing a better job at ensuring analyst classes have a better intake (of women),\" said Claudia Jury, global co-head of currencies and emerging markets at JPMorgan and a senior sponsor for the program. The bank has hired around 30 women through the program since 2016, it said. Goldman Sachs started its Trader Academy in London last year, offering eight months of mentoring, networking and job shadowing for 16 female college students. The bank plans to expand the program to the Americas this year and Asia soon after. Goldman has said it wants women to eventually make up half of its overall workforce, but acknowledges trading is far from that goal. \"Having women in particular from a trading perspective has always been a challenge for us,\" said Janine Glasenberg, the bank's head of graduate recruiting in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Banks are so keen to improve their diversity ratios that one declined to make young female traders available for interviews out of fear they might get poached by competitors. Shareholder pressure aside, managers and some studies say hiring more women simply makes business sense. David Hesketh, chief executive of a London-based startup TradingHub said trading simulations the company ran in 2014 and 2015 for hundreds of interns as part of banks' recruitment programs showed women made fewer trades and took fewer risks. They would also break the rules less than half as often as men. In all, having more women on a team could translate into savings on brokerage fees, loss provisions, and fines. \"That is kind of nuts, if you think some firms are getting fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Hesketh said. Boys' club vibe Yet former female traders interviewed by Reuters describe an industry, which has left behind discriminatory attitudes common only a decade ago, but where women remain heavily outnumbered and can sometimes feel like outsiders in a \"boys' club.\" Simmy Grover, who worked as an equity trader at Morgan Stanley in London between 2006 and 2009, recalled how just over a decade ago one investment bank was ready to offer her a job, but just could not imagine her on the trading floor. \"I remember walking into an interview and I was asked why I had applied for trading because I was a woman and I should be applying to sales.\" Grover, now a researcher at the University College London, said she ended up working as a trader elsewhere anyway. While she said she never felt marginalized on the job, she would sometimes get overlooked by brokers hosting social events- typically involving watching a soccer game and a trip to the pub. Divya Krishnan, who was a trader between 2009 and 2014 as part of Citi's program for quantitative analysts, said in her time the bank was already trying to help young recruits, offering networking opportunities and linking them up with experienced female traders. They told them, she recalls, to be confident and avoid apologizing too much, something she said women tended to do. But like Grover she found it was harder to fit in after hours. \"I was never a sports person, but that was always a topic of conversation. I had to learn that,\" Krishnan, who now works for fintech startup Motif, said. While workplace culture is slow to change, banks focus their outreach in colleges on broadening a pool of potential candidates by dispelling the myth that only math wizards or those with finance degrees can succeed in trading. \"We spend a lot of the time encouraging women who have liberal arts backgrounds to look at this business,\" said Amanda Magliaro, a managing director and head of global structured finance distribution at Citigroup. Magliaro, who graduated as a Japanese language major and holds an MBA in finance, said the efforts, including interview coaching for women joining its internship program, were bearing fruit: \"It has improved the numbers.\" Headhunters say, however, it will take time before effects of such efforts show up in banks' gender ratios. \"Firms would like to have more women in trading and other areas, but there aren't that many women in the pipeline,\" said Ross Gregory, a director at recruitment firm Proco Commodities.

Markets had widely anticipated that the central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee would raise interest rates a quarter-point at the meeting. The 0.25 percentage point hike takes the benchmark funds target range to 1.75 percent to 2 percent. This is Powell's second news conference since taking over the central bank reins earlier this year. Some market participants are anticipating that Powell ultimately will hold the sessions after each of the FOMC's eight meetings each year.

The U.S.-listed shares of Tal closed nearly 10 percent lower after briefly falling more than 15 percent in morning trading. As of Wednesday's close, the stock was up almost 105 percent over the last 12 months. Estimates indicate Tal has overstated net income by at least 43.6 percent for the last two fiscal years, Block's firm Muddy Waters said in a release Wednesday. \"TAL combines the old school China fraud playbook of simply penciling in more favorable numbers with the more sophisticated asset parking fraud of Enron,\" the short seller added in a report. Muddy Waters cited its research into 1,000 pages of Chinese government files on various entities belonging to or associated with Tal, and third-party credit reports on many of those entities. Enron was a Houston energy company that collapsed in 2001 after an accounting scandal to hide financial losses sent the once-hot stock spiraling down.

The stock also posted its biggest one-day gain since December 2017, when it gained 4.9 percent. Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC, said Wednesday it would pay $65 billion for Fox's movie studios, stakes in Hulu, Sky and Endemol Shine Group, as well as networks FX, Star TV and National Geographic. Comcast is also a co-owner of Hulu. The shares are still down 17 percent this year on concern it may be overpaying for assets, but investors appeared to be rethinking that Thursday. The bid puts Comcast on a collision course with Disney, which agreed to buy those same assets for $52.4 billion in December. Fox turned down an earlier offer from Comcast. Disney shares rose 2.3 percent and were the best performers in the Dow Jones industrial average. Fox's stock, meanwhile climbed 2.1 percent. Getty Images Comcast chairman and CEO Brian L. Roberts. John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note that buying Fox would be \"immediately accretive\" to Comcast's free cash flow and earnings per share, noting it would boost both metrics by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points. He also said Comcast addressed some of the regulatory concerns initially raised by Fox, \"making it difficult for FOXA's Board to continue to move ahead with the DIS offer in its current form.\" \"CMCSA's letter to the FOX Board noted that its deal is as likely, if not more, to receive regulatory approval than the DIS bid, with no meaningful difference in timing. This view is partially driven by the large int'l exposure of the FOX/Sky assets as well as slightly less overlap among domestic businesses relative to DIS,\" Janedis said. However, Moody's said Comcast's offer is \"credit negative\" for the company, noting: \" The total pro forma debt for the combined companies would be approximately $170 billion of total debt, the world's second-most indebted company ... after pro forma AT&T-Time Warner once it closes.\" The Comcast bid came a day after a federal judge approved AT&T's deal to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion.

Whether in the bond, stock or currency market, there are implications from the latest step by the ECB. The central bank was clear, after a meeting Thursday, that its trillion-euro asset purchase program will end in December if the economy remained resilient and that a rate hike is unlikely to come before the second half of 2019. \"From an investment perspective, I think you have to ask yourself about peripheral valuations and German bund valuations,\" Scott Thiel, deputy chief investment officer of global fundamental fixed income at Blackrock, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Friday. show chapters US has higher potential growth than Europe, analyst says 3:48 AM ET Fri, 15 June 2018 | 03:47 The bond market could suffer from the fact that the ECB will be phasing out its market intervention and will effectively stop buying government bonds in January. Since 2015, the ECB has conducted systematic purchases bonds and both governments and market players knew that European debt would be bought no matter what. Now that the ECB will stop being such a predictable buyer, the market could be more volatile. As a result, Thiel said that the end of this quantitative easing (QE) \"clearly makes (German) bunds look a little bit more attractive.\" This is because German debt is perceived as less risky than that of peripheral countries (like Greece, Italy and Portugal) and where for instance political turmoil is often a cause of concern. But Thiel added that despite the end of QE, the debt from these peripheral countries is still attractive. He said: \"I don't want to own bunds at minus 50 basis points, I would rather own Portugal at minus 15.\" The principle seems to be that even though there are higher chances of getting loans to the German government repaid on time, there are higher returns when lending to Portugal. show chapters GSAM CEO: Emerging markets present interesting investment opportunities 5:38 AM ET Fri, 15 June 2018 | 03:52 Of Italian debt alone, the ECB bought 3.6 billion euros ($ 4.17 billion) in the month of May. It is buying total of 30 billion euros every month at the moment. \"The average funding cost on outstanding debt for the periphery is now lower than in 2011 (in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis) while the average maturity is higher,\" analysts at Barclays said in a research note Friday. This means that buying peripheral debt is less expensive now than at the wake of the debt crisis, yet the risk of any default is also lower given that there aren't outstanding repayments due in the short term. Also, Goldman Sachs Asset Management is positive that there won't be massive changes in the bond market in the coming years. The ECB is ending QE in December but it's not raising rates until, at least, September of next year.

Greece's parliament on Thursday passed a fast-track reform package to unlock bailout funds and wrap up a fourth and final review of its loan programme as it seeks more debt relief from its official creditors next week. Greece is due to exit its latest bailout programme in August and will then have to rely on financial markets to cover its borrowing needs. The country has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 179.8 percent, the highest in the 19-nation euro zone. Athens is keen to pass the final review of the country's compliance with reforms prescribed in its bailout before a euro zone finance ministers meeting on June 21. A green light on the review would release about 12 billion euros ($13.97 billion) of new loans from Greece's latest 86 billion euro bailout, its third since 2010. The final payment from the bailout funds would add to a cash buffer the Greek government is creating and could serve as a fall-back option for refinancing needs. Lawmakers passed the reform package 154-to-144 in the 300-seat parliament. It was endorsed by lawmakers of the leftist-led alliance while all other opposition parties voted it down. \"This government smothered Greeks with taxes. It crushed growth and pushed the middle-class to poverty,\" said conservative opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis during a heated debate on the reforms bill. \"You created a large mass of desperate people who are drowning in debt and have no hope for the future,\" he said. Louisa Gouliamaki | AFP | Getty Images A woman walks past a graffiti refering to the Greek debt and reading 'Forever a loan' outside the Academy of Athens building on August 28, 2017. Athens has agreed to adhere to a post-bailout fiscal trajectory that targets primary budget surpluses - excluding debt servicing outlays - of 3.5 percent of GDP until 2022 and of at least 2.0 percent thereafter. This gives the government little room for manoeuvre for tax relief unless it fiscally outperforms, generating even larger budget savings. The reform package legislation includes measures to expedite privatisations in the energy sector and tweaks in real estate taxes. It also outlines measures that will go into effect in the post bailout period such as extra pension cuts in 2019 and a lower tax exempt threshold in 2020.

Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo stand to split as much as $480 million in fees if Comcast's $65 billion offer for Twenty-First Century Fox's film and cable assets is accepted, according to estimates from Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. Comcast, the parent of CNBC, made its all-cash offer Wednesday, setting up a showdown with rival Disney, which earlier agreed to pay $52.4 billion in stock for the Fox assets. Disney may increase its bid and include a cash component to try to win the deal, CNBC has reported. A federal judge's approval this week of another megadeal, the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, has unleashed activity in the media sector as content and delivery companies look to gain scale amid threats from newer entrants including Netflix and Amazon. The Fox assets in play include movie studios, cable networks, stakes in a European pay-TV provider and streaming service Hulu, and regional U.S. sports networks. If the Comcast-Fox deal happens, merger and acquisition bankers including Goldman, Deutsche Bank and Centerview Partners will split as much as $180 million in advisory fees, according to Nassof. Scott Mlyn | CNBC A man stands beside the 21st Century Fox sign outside their offices in New York. The bigger haul will be from the financing of the $65 billion offer by Comcast, he said. Short term financing in the form of a bridge loan could yield $100 million in fees, the lion's share going to Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Then when that loan gets replaced with a bond offering, that could yield another $200 million in fees for a group of banks, he said. Since about 90 percent of an M&A banker's fees comes after a deal is closed, advisors on either the Comcast or Disney side are set up for some disappointment. \"It's a pretty big blow\" to the bankers of whichever side loses the deal, Nassof said. The sell-side advisors to Fox will be getting paid in either scenario. Investment bankers were already on track to have a banner year.

The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) fell more than 1.5 percent in midday Friday trading, tracking for its first seven-day losing streak since December 2016. The ETF tracks major Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong. Friday's drop came as major U.S. stock indexes fell on fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China. For the week, the ETF was trading 3.9 percent lower, tracking for its worst week since March 23. In addition to worries about trade, Chinese data on retail sales and industrial activity missed expectations, raising concerns about economic slowdown. Just seven components are up for the week, led by Anhui Conch Cement. Chinese tech giant Tencent, the largest company by market capitalization in the ETF, fell 1.25 percent in the last week. Other major decliners included Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and PetroChina. ZTE was by far the worst performer, falling nearly 49 percent this week after ending a nearly two-month trading halt on Wednesday. The Chinese telecom equipment giant settled with the U.S. last week to pay up to $1.4 billion for violating a March 2017 agreement. Until it makes the payment, ZTE remains banned from buying from U.S. components.

Now, it has begun preparing for what could be an early end to this program. In turn, the move also could lead to fewer interest rate hikes than the central bank is currently forecasting. At stake is the size of the Fed's balance sheet where it holds the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it bought during three rounds of stimulus that began in late-2008 and concluded in October 2016. Where once Fed officials believed the balance sheet would shrink from about $4.5 trillion to a range of $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion, the required level may be considerably higher, depending on how much in reserves the banking system will need to remain liquid. Reducing the bond holdings results in a decrease in reserves. No central bank in the world has ever attempted a balance sheet reduction on this scale, so the skill to which the Fed can pull it off is critical. As the Fed has been continuing the program, financial markets have tightened and may require a quicker exit from the program than officials had figured. Markets had been anticipating that the program would run for several more years, but Wall Street pros are now considering a much sooner end. \"Our risk scenario to excess reserves ... suggests the balance sheet could be 'normalized' by summer next year,\" BNP Paribas said in a research note Wednesday. \"The Fed is making and will likely need to make further changes as liquidity evolves to remain in control of money market rates.\" Andrew Harrer | Getty Images Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. In a move that it had telegraphed ahead of time, the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday raised the interest it pays on excess reserves by 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage points. It did so at the same time it hiked the federal funds rate, which the FOMC uses as its benchmark, 25 basis points. The interest rate on excess reserves, known as the IOER, is now 1.95 percent while the funds rate was set in a target of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. The Fed sets the IOER at the high end of the funds range to keep the benchmark rate in check, but the difference between the two has narrowed sharply in recent weeks. The Fed hopes that a lower increase in the IOER will hold back the funds rate. What happens next is when things will get interesting. Fed officials aren't sure why the funds rate had been rising to the top end of its range. While there's a belief that it is in large part due to increased issuance of short-term Treasury bills to pay for the increase in government spending, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that uncertainty remains. \"This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally,\" Powell said at a news conference following the FOMC meeting. However, he added that when it comes figuring out why the funds rate has been pushing to the top end of its range, he said, \"The truth is we don't know with any precision.\" The situation impacts interest rates in that tighter financial conditions could push the Fed to reconsider the pace of its policy normalization overall. The Fed currently is holding about $1.9 trillion in excess reserves, a level that has come down more than $200 billion since the balance sheet runoff started in October. The Fed is allowing a set amount of proceeds from its bonds run off each month, until that level hits $50 billion in October 2018. Markets will be watching closely to see how the relationship between the funds rate and IOER evolves. Since the rate-hiking cycle began in December 2015, the Fed has been adept at keeping the funds rate at the midpoint of the target range. However, despite the Fed on Wednesday telegraphing a fourth rate hike this year that would happen in December, one more than earlier forecasts, markets are expressing uncertainty. Traders are only assigning a 57.6 percent chance of an additional hike to close out the year, according the latest CME projections.

Venmo application (app). Despite the ubiquity of mobile payments, a top executive at Venmo says the world is still a few generations away from abandoning cash altogether. \"It's a matter of time \u2014 but it's going to be a long time, not a next year kind of thing,\" said Michael Vaughan, the chief operating officer of Venmo, at the Wharton Global Forum in New York on Friday. \"It's still decades, and decades, and decades. It's going to take our lifetime and our kids' lifetime before you start to see this work itself out.\" Venmo, owned by PayPal, is one of the world's leading mobile payment services. In the first quarter, the company processed roughly $12 billion in total payment volume in the U.S., which Vaughan said marked roughly 80 percent growth year over year. Despite domestic growth, the U.S. is in the middle of the pack and \"just starting to scratch the surface\" when it comes to mobile payment adoption. Finland and Sweden, as well as parts of Asia, tend to be the leaders, while Latin America and South America are the biggest laggards, Vaughan said. \"It's very much market by market,\" he said, adding that in some countries, people need cash as protection. \"It's the lowest common denominator, until you get the whole thing moving along you're going to have to have that other cash piece.\" Venmo's parent company PayPal operates in more than 200 countries around the world and is working to expand its offerings. In May, it announced its biggest acquisition yet -- a deal to buy payments start-up iZettle for $2.2 billion. Mobile payments have become a battleground for financial institutions as millennials, especially, swap cash for digital. \"Everybody and their brother is getting into it,\" Vaughan said. \"But a rising tide lift all boats as more people get comfortable using their phones to pay.\" Zelle, a person-to-person payments system backed by Bank of America, Wells Fargo and dozens of other major U.S. banks, launched last year. Square Cash, the mobile payment app developed by Square, also competes with Venmo and PayPal. Since early 2016, Square Cash app downloads have outpaced Venmo's, according to a Nomura analysis. \"It's pretty ubiquitous now, and general it's a good thing for consumers,\" Vaughan said.

The digital currency ether rose 8.8 percent to a high of $520.68, according to CoinDesk. Its price has struggled along with other cryptocurrencies this year, and has dropped about 35 percent since January. While SEC leaders have publicly labeled bitcoin as a commodity, this is the first clear statement by the financial watchdog on how they plan to regulate ether. \"We don't see a lot of value in seeing ether as a security,\" William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporate Finance for the SEC, said at the Yahoo All Markets Summit: Crypto conference in San Francisco. \"Ether is a coin that is evolving.\" Hinman cited the cryptocurrency's decentralized and public network, and lack of a third party expecting to make a profit as reasons that the agency won't treat it like a security. \"In case of Ether as we interact with market participants, we keep gathering info and at some point we say this is something we should make clearer,\" he said. Ether's one-day performance Source: CoinDesk The digital currency, which has a market value of $50.39 billion according to CoinDesk, is backed by the company Ethereum. It has often been described as \"fuel\" or \"gas\" to power the Ethereum network, a blockchain platform aimed at \"smart contracts.\" Ethereum has become a popular platform for developers using blockchain. A consortium called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance for example, which includes companies like Microsoft and JP Morgan, is using the Ethereum blockchain to build applications. Hinman did not categorize other cryptocurrencies, which are having the same identity crisis with regulators. The cryptocurrency XRP is the subject of a lawsuit alleging that it is a security. Ripple is the name of the San Francisco-based company developing a network for faster global financial payments, while XRP is the name of the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. Executives from Ripple have said without a doubt, XRP is not a security. The agency will look at other cryptocurrencies on a case-by-case basis, Hinman said. Moving too quickly in search of a label could cause the agency to miss key facts and circumstances, which can vary dramatically depending on the cryptocurrency, he said. \"We don't think establishing a lot of bright lines is helpful,\" Hinman said. \"We don't want to react too quickly, we do want to protect investors but not stifle innovation.\" ", "author": "Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/cryptocurrency-ether-soars-9-percent-after-sec-official-says-its-not-a-security.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2:47 PM ET Thu", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "14", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "01:10", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Securities and Exchange Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "520.68", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "about 35 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "January", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "William Hinman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Division of Corporate Finance", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "San Francisco", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Hinman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "third", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "one-day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$50.39 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "CoinDesk", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ethereum", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Ethereum", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Microsoft", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "JP Morgan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ethereum", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Hinman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "XRP", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "San Francisco", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "XRP", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "XRP", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Hinman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hinman", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "The world's second largest cryptocurrency ether jumped roughly 9 percent Thursday after a key SEC official made it clear that it is not a security.", "title": "Cryptocurrency ether soars 9% after SEC official says it's not a security", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/01/105174288-GettyImages-951165946.jpg?v=1536697346"}, {"time": "2018-06-15T06:26:32-0400", "body": " Getty Images People walk by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on December 19, 2017 in New York City. A proposal to simplify a rule banning banks from proprietary trading, rather than making life easier for Wall Street, could ensnare billions of dollars' worth of assets not currently caught by the regulation. This little-noticed wrinkle, if it were to make it into the final rule, could prompt Wall Street firms to overhaul their Treasury, trading and merchant banking operations and change their accounting practices, lawyers and executives told Reuters. On May 30, U.S. regulators unveiled a plan to modify the so-called Volcker Rule introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, aiming to make compliance easier for many firms and relieving small banks altogether. Wall Street has long complained about the complexity and subjectivity of the rule, which bans banks that accept U.S. taxpayer-insured deposits \u2014 such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley \u2014 from engaging in short-term speculative trading. Republicans, the business lobby and analysts initially welcomed the proposal as a long overdue move to streamline and clarify the rule, while consumer advocates and progressive Democrats criticized it as a risky Wall Street giveaway. But after digesting the 494-page consultation, financial industry executives and lawyers said it could actually create new headaches for big banks by banning a swath of trades and long-term investments not currently covered by the rule. \"It's going to capture trades that wouldn't be captured by the current regulation and that's the bogeyman people would want to avoid in this proposal,\" said Jacques Schillaci, a banking lawyer at Linklaters who has studied the proposal. The draft is subject to a 60-day consultation period during which industry participants will lobby for changes, with a final version, which is likely to be substantially revised, expected around January. One of the most-hated aspects of the Volcker Rule presumes purchases and sales of instruments within 60 days count as proprietary unless the bank can prove they qualify for an exemption, such as market making or hedging. This part of the rule aims to identify short-term trades that are intended to be speculative in nature, but banks say it is too subjective because it would require second-guessing traders' intentions. Regulators have proposed replacing it with a more objective test, based on the accounting treatment of the instruments traded. Under the new test, trading activity by desks that daily book net realized or unrealized gains and losses exceeding $25 million is only allowed if the bank shows that trading qualifies for the rule's exemptions. Since the crisis, however, banks have applied this mark-to-market or \"fair value\" accounting treatment to a range of longer-term investments to better manage their risk. As a result, the proposal would bring under the rule the vast majority of equity investments, derivatives and a range of fixed income securities that banks hold for many years but not to maturity. While some of these investments, such as U.S. Treasurys, other government-related securities, and some derivatives, would qualify for exemptions, many would end up being prohibited given the relatively low $25 million thresholds, the industry experts said. This could disrupt how bank groups structure their trading desks and manage their strategic investments and risk. The proposal may also prompt banks to elect not to mark-to-market some assets. Spokespeople for the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation declined to comment. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the agency looked forward to reviewing stakeholder comments. Hidden risks The rewrite of the Volcker Rule comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump-appointed regulators to boost bank lending and economic growth by relaxing regulations. Brought into law by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the Volcker Rule is one of the most politically sensitive post-crisis rules and any changes will be closely-watched by Democratic critics, who warn tinkering with it could increase risks to the financial system. But the accounting snag also underscores the hidden risks of rewriting complex financial rules for the banking industry, which could confront a new set of problems \u2014 and costs \u2014 if the effort does not go as they had hoped. \"Tinkering with these rules, and regulatory change, imposes cost in and of itself, said Cliff Stanford, a banking regulation lawyer at Alston & Bird. Regulators have said they are very open to feedback on how to refine the draft and the banking industry will lobby aggressively on this particular issue, the executives and lawyers said. While the banks may push the regulators to narrow the scope of the new accounting test, expand the current exemptions, or raise the $25 million limit, scrapping the test altogether will be a tough sell. Regulators see it as a failsafe that prevents firms from evading the rule and believe focusing on the accounting treatment is clearer and more enforceable than the current 60-day intent test. \"There isn't such a thing as a perfect fix for what they're trying to do with this aspect of the rule,\" said Schillaci.

Markets are on the lookout for clues from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's post-meeting briefing on how long the central bank could hold off on whittling down stimulus given recent disappointingly weak price growth. As widely expected, the Bank of Japan kept its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent. The move contrasts with the European Central Bank's decision to end its asset-purchase program this year and the U.S. Federal Reserve's steady rate increases, which signaled a break from policies deployed to battle the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \"Consumer price growth is in a range of 0.5 to 1 percent,\" the BOJ said in a statement accompanying the decision. That was a slightly bleaker view than in the previous meeting in April, when the central bank said inflation was moving around 1 percent. The BOJ stuck to its view the economy was expanding moderately, unfazed by a first-quarter contraction that many analysts blame on temporary factors like bad weather. But it also maintained its cautious assessment on prospects for hitting its elusive 2 percent inflation target, saying that inflation expectations were moving sideways. The delay in pulling out of crisis-era stimulus would leave the BOJ with a lack of ammunition to fight another economic downturn, even as its U.S. and European peers start restocking their tool-kit. Japan's economy shrank an annualized 0.6 percent in the first quarter, though many analysts expect growth to bounce back on solid exports and capital expenditure. Before the latest contraction, the economy benefited from a global exports boom that continues to underpin a synchronized uptick in world growth. Core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier, slowing for the second straight month, casting doubt on the BOJ's view a solid recovery will prompt firms to raise wages and help accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target. Given recent weak inflation, the BOJ's nine board members may look more closely into structural factors that may be holding back price growth, according to sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking. While the findings likely won't be revealed until a subsequent meeting in July, Kuroda may offer some hints at his briefing, analysts say. Markets are also on the look-out for what Kuroda could say on escalating trade frictions and U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on auto imports \u2014 both risks to the export-reliant economy. The International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that Trump's new import tariffs threaten to undermine the global trading system, prompt retaliation by other countries and damage the U.S. economy.

It's visible,\" he said. But \"at some point it'll be obsolete.\" Friedman is founder of online publication Geopolitical Futures and the author of \"The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century.\" His views on the world often run contrary to mainstream thought. For example, he expects the U.S. will remain a dominant power, while China will struggle and is not as strong of a global player as others think. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that soared well over 1,000 percent last year, is the first application of blockchain. The technology eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary such as a bank by quickly and securely recording transactions between two parties by using encryption technology. Since the development of bitcoin, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects have emerged. Proponents say blockchain can one day change the world as much as the internet did. Some analysts have noted that if and when an emerging technology called quantum computing matures, it could easily decrypt blockchain. However, they emphasize such a scenario is still years away and blockchain technology itself may also have evolved by that point. Friedman said blockchain is \"one of those hypes. People [are] profiting from it, making extraordinary claims about it.\" Investors have poured more than $9 billion into new cryptocurrency projects called initial coin offerings this year, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. \u2014 CNBC's Miguel Pineda contributed to this report.

China is promising retaliatory measures. The White House also recently hit U.S. allies Canada, Mexico and the European Union with steel and aluminum import tariffs, a move that also was met with retaliatory measures. \"I'm really worried that ... these things are going to get out of control. Somebody is going to announce something that then triggers a more serious issue,\" Ermotti said, stressing trade risk \"could come from any side, Europe, U.S., China; you name it.\" Extreme protectionism could become a real problem if there are any other unexpected events such as the Federal Reserve accelerating the path of interest rate hikes, he said. \"Asset classes are priced quite high across the board. Expectations for business profitability are quite high. The financial markets are not ready for any major discontinuity ... in commercial ties between countries,\" Ermotti said. The chief executive at UBS, one of the world's biggest managers of billionaires' money, described stocks as not yet priced to perfection but getting close. \"You can still see value in equities\" for the time being. 'We basically bank with one out of two billionaires' in Asia Ermotti also told CNBC that UBS is putting more emphasis on catering to high net-worth investors in the U.S. and even more so in Asia. He said the firm is following the money. In the Americas, UBS has 7,000 advisors who contribute 33 percent of their profits before taxes. In Asia, the company has fewer advisors, roughly 1,100, who contribute 27 percent of the profits before taxes. \"In Asia, you have to think that we basically bank with one out of two billionaires in the region,\" Ermotti said. \"Every four days in China, there is a new billionaire. Last year, the numbers of billionaires in China really [overtook] the U.S. And in [a] few years' time, they're going to have more wealth than the U.S.\" Some of that wealth in Asia may find its way to U.S. and Europe, he said. \"Before a couple of years ago, Asia investors in general were very interested in investing in Asia. And rightly so, they had so much opportunity, he said. \"Now you're seeing more and more investors willing to diversify their portfolios across globally in the U.S. or Europe.\" Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

had amid the volatility, veteran fund manager Larry Glazer told CNBC on Friday. U.S. stocks cut their losses on Friday after fears of a trade war eased. Earlier in the day, the market fell after the Trump administration said it would impose a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods. The Dow Jones industrial average ultimately closed 84.83 points lower at 25,090.48, It certainly won't be a \"calm and easy summer,\" said Glazer, managing partner and portfolio manager at Mayflower Advisors. However, \"the geopolitical concerns are going to create a buying opportunity for investors who are daring over the next few weeks,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" show chapters Buy US small cap stocks if you're afraid of a trade war, says strategist 6:50 PM ET Fri, 15 June 2018 | 01:46 The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday that the U.S. will initially impose a set of tariffs on 818 items worth about $34 billion on July 6. Separate measures worth about $16 billion could take effect following a review and public comment process. China quickly struck back, announcing a 25 percent levy on $34 billion of U.S. goods, also slated to take effect July 6. \"Trade wars can be inflationary and they can slow the economy. But I think the fundamental backdrop is really solid,\" Glazer said. \"Investors have to focus on earnings and the tax cuts are the gift that keeps on giving throughout this year. But we're going to need a strong stomach,\" he added. Chris Bertelsen, president and chief investment officer at Aviance Capital Management, said while the stock market has been \"pretty blase\" about the trade war situation, he thinks it could become contagious. \"The comments really don't help. I mean, Canada doesn't have a huge deficit with the U.S. and yet the talk about it is pretty strong,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" \"The new tariffs on China, I think, could well be the start of a back and forth.\" That's not healthy for stocks, particularly franchise growth stocks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, he noted. While he's staying away from consumer staples, he thinks there are real opportunities in high-dividend players like AT&T and Seagate Technology. And while those who fear a trade war may find a \"safe place\" in U.S. small-cap stocks, he said he's not sure that is the right place to be because he thinks at the end of the day all this will all \"blow over.\" Evan Newmark, a private investor and CNBC contributor, agrees. While fleeing to small caps is a classic reaction, he thinks the \"bad scenario\" for the market has nothing to do with companies, their earnings or their trade flows. \"It has to do with sentiment in the market,\" he said on \"Closing Bell.\" \"If the sentiment turns against the president and against the global economy, it's bad for everybody,\" he added.

The Chinese State Council's commission on tariffs and customs said in an online statement that a 25 percent tariff will take effect July 6 on $34 billion of U.S. goods. The list includes soybeans, electric vehicles, a range of hybrid electric vehicles, a variety of seafood and pork, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The tariffs counter the United States Trade Representative's announcement earlier on Friday that the U.S. will initially impose an additional 25 percent tariff on 818 Chinese imports worth about $34 billion on July 6. Duties on an additional $16 billion worth of goods from China will need to undergo public review. If approved, that would bring the total to $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Peter Klaunzer | AFP | Getty Images China's President Xi Jinping Similarly, the State Council's announcement said China's overall proposal covers 659 U.S. goods worth $50 billion. A list of 114 U.S. goods subject to tariffs at a later date include crude oil, diesel and magnetic resonance imaging kits, the Ministry of Commerce said. The announcement was made early Friday afternoon New York time, or very early Saturday morning Beijing time. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said earlier Friday that Beijing would immediately introduce tariffs on the \"same scale\" and strength as the U.S. The ministry also said results from previous trade negotiations were now nullified.

From trade issues to political uncertainty and central bank policy, there are a number of factors to assess. Nonetheless, the consensus view suggests that a growth re-acceleration is underway, with profits to be made in the equity market. \"There are clear signs that economic growth is set to accelerate across major regions in the second half of 2018, creating a favorable climate for equities and certain commodities,\" Michael Strobaek, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse said in a note last week. Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, expressed a similar opinion. \"Over the second half of the year, we expect some re-acceleration in growth,\" she said in a note. Solid growth, better earnings According to projections from the International Monetary Fund in April, the global economy is set grow 3.9 percent in 2018. In the second half of last year alone, global growth hit 4 percent. The economic momentum seen mainly at the end of last year has carried into 2018, \"translating into robust corporate earnings,\" Ward said. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images By following certain rules, you can manage your portfolio to withstand potential negative impacts of volatility and take advantage of opportunities that volatility can afford. Data collected from the bank showed that earnings reports beat expectations in all the major markets \u2014 Europe, Japan and the U.S. \u2014 in the first quarter of 2018. In theory, this suggests that companies have more money to pay back to investors, thus increasing the attractiveness of the equity market. 'The perfect recipe for systemic risks' However, there are external factors that require attention when picking stocks. \"Investors should remain alert to the potential impact of trade frictions and other political and policy risks,\" Strobaek, from Credit Suisse added. Investors have been wary of changes to the status quo in trade following decisions from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs against allied countries. Europe, Canada and Japan are subject to a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, as the U.S. tries to reduce its trade imbalance with other nations. But Trump's move has caused jitters in those countries, which are due to impose retaliatory duties against the U.S. too. At the same time, the U.S. has also raised duties for Chinese products and authorities in the world's second-largest economy have responded with the same amount of tariffs.

Concerns that a populist government in Italy could come into place and prompt a break up from the euro zone sent Italian debt yields higher. This had some spill over effects to the rest of the euro zone. There are also worries about potential market shocks coming from central bankers as they reduce stimulus. \"The combination of political, monetary, financial factors is more worrisome than any of them taken in isolation,\" Francesco Filia, fund manager at Fasanara Capital told CNBC via email Friday.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to deposit $1 billion in Ethiopia's central bank to ease the latter's foreign exchange shortage. The sum is part of a $3 billion aid and investment pledge from the UAE to Ethiopia announced Friday. The news came as Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia's foreign exchange shortage is due in part to its spending big on infrastructure projects. The current total left in the East African country's coffers is equivalent to less than one month's worth of imports, Reuters has reported. In April, Abiy said that Ethiopia's foreign exchange shortage could last 15 to 20 years, and that more cooperation with the private sector was needed to secure the country's finances. Over the weekend, Ethiopia and neighboring Somalia announced that they were investing in four seaports on the Red Sea to draw in foreign investment. Abiy and Somalian President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, speaking in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, issued a joint statement of pledges to cooperate on areas including infrastructure and visa services, according to Reuters. The Red Sea coastline is strategic because it leads to the Suez Canal, a shipping channel which effectively serves as a gateway between Eastern and Western markets. Landlocked Ethiopia is keen to shore up its international trade infrastructure, for example taking a stake in the Port of Djibouti in May. The weekend's news is the latest in a slew of reforms coming out of the Ethiopian government. In early June, lawmakers voted to lift Ethiopia's state of emergency two months early. This was imposed following the sudden resignation of former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in February following anti-government protests fueled by ethnic tension. show chapters Opportunity in Africa is driven by amazing demographics for growth: Citigroup 6:28 AM ET Wed, 7 March 2018 | 03:25 Shortly after, the Ethiopian government said it would implement a historic peace deal with neighboring Eritrea, formerly a province of Ethiopia. The deal, though signed in 2000, did nothing to end a military standoff along the two countries' borders. Abiy, as reported by Reuters, said that Ethiopia and Eritrea should work to grow their economic and infrastructural ties. In addition, the Ethiopian government said it would allow private investment in some areas of the heavily state-controlled economy, including national carrier Ethiopian Airlines and the telecoms sector. Ethiopia, a country that has seen double digit gross domestic product (GDP) expansion as recently as 2017, has espoused a China-style state-led development model in order to achieve economic growth. But, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's 2014 estimate, 29.6 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.

Enthusiasm readings indicate Democrats have lost some of their advantage. Democrats are within reach of gaining a House majority, Goldman said in a report Monday.

Goldman notes the outlook is likely to shift as Election Day draws near. It lists five things to watch: Special elections in solidly Republican districts in Texas and Ohio, Washington state's primary, which like California, advances the top two candidates to the general election, primary contests in Arizona and Missouri, ballot initiatives that could affect voter turnout in key battleground states, and developments in Washington. Goldman says the midterm election outcome is less consequential for financial markets than the 2016 election. Only control of Congress is in question, not the White House.

Germany may only account for 3.4 percent of the world economy, but it is more than a quarter of the European Union's demand and output. The EU, in turn, is close to 20 percent of the world economy, and, based on last year's numbers, it takes $283.5 billion of U.S. exports, or 18.3 percent of America's total goods sold overseas. What the U.S. sells to the EU is more than 40 percent of all the goods America exports to China and Japan. That shows that the damage caused to the U.S. economy transcends, by far, Germany's surplus of $64.2 billion on American trades in 2017. Imagine, for example, what would happen to the EU economy, to the rest of the world \u2014 and to U.S. export sales in general \u2014 if Germany were not living off its fellow Europeans with a massive 164.4 billion euro trade surplus. That German surplus is stifling the economic growth in the rest of Europe, because it is a deficit for countries trading with Germany. You can think of those 164.4 billion euros as a large wealth transfer to Germany. Indeed, it is a structural foundation of Germany's export-driven economy, where sales to the rest of the world account for nearly a half of German GDP (compared with 14 percent in the U.S. case). Ask nicely \u2014 Germany may cooperate What Europe, the U.S. and the rest of the world need here is a radical change of German economic policies. Germany should be generating more growth from domestic demand to give an opportunity to its trade partners to sell more of their goods and services on German markets. That would boost intra-European growth and create opportunities for more American sales to Europe \u2014 its largest overseas customer. There is nothing new here. It's a very old story Germans don't even want to talk about. And why should they? France is meekly taking it on the chin with annual deficits of 36 to 41 billion euros on its German trades, and the rest of Europe does not dare question what it wrongly sees as a virtuously strong German economy. Strong, indeed, at their own expense. So, after the rebuffed Obama administration pleadings to stop suffocating Europe with Berlin-imposed fiscal austerity on deeply depressed economies, America's new government has been trying to do what Europeans don't dare. And through it all, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the G-20 (the world's main economic forum) keep looking the other way and blaming the U.S. for starting trade wars and wrecking the \"rules-based multilateral trading system.\" It all sounds like a joke that, inexplicably, U.S. diplomacy continues to tolerate. After more than a year, Washington is getting nowhere with its complaints about a $151.4 billion trade deficit with the European Union, and the financial burden it carries for NATO allies falling far short of their financial contributions to the common defense. Now, it looks like the U.S. is losing patience. With the most recent data showing that the trade deficit with the EU is getting worse, Washington is beginning to attack with import tariffs \u2014 trade instruments leading to unproductive retaliatory skirmishes that will needlessly inflict a large political damage on trans-Atlantic relations. Don't repeat the China error How about having a different conversation, such as: (a) Do Europeans understand that their large and systematic trade surpluses with the U.S. are wrong, unfair and damaging to the U.S. economy?; (b) If they do, what corrective measures, and over what period of time, are they prepared to undertake to balance their trade accounts with the U.S.? That sort of conversation should begin, and end, at the highest level of state and government, with the understanding that the relief is being sought among close allies, in an atmosphere devoid of taunts, threats and other unseemly behavior. It should, however, leave no doubt that the Europeans are being asked, firmly, to square their U.S. trade books as promptly as possible. That is not a na\u00efve choir-boy approach. It is an entirely appropriate entry level discourse, recognizing the simple evidence that the Europeans have a problem, and that they cannot avoid taking action to solve it. Arguments advanced by the Europeans and the Chinese that America's fair and reciprocal trades would undermine multilateralism and globalization should be put aside. They are talking forum (e.g., G-20) discussions for another day. The here and now issue is that Washington has a $595.4 billion problem with China, the EU and Japan. That is an urgent matter whose friendly and orderly solution does not require any regulatory changes to the current world trading system. Once the political agreement is reached on a decision to balance trade accounts, and on a specific time-frame to reach that objective, trade negotiators could be given instructions on the way to proceed. The key proviso being that the White House, and its counterparts in China, the EU and Japan would continue to closely monitor, and steer, the unfolding trade adjustment process. But Washington has taken things the other way around. That's clear in the case of China. Instead of settling things at the highest political level, the U.S. hit China with import tariffs, forcing Beijing to respond in kind. And then, to limit the political and economic fallout, Washington last week sent State Secretary Mike Pompeo to Beijing in a damage-control exercise. At the same time, President Donald Trump was gushing with declarations of friendship for Chinese President Xi Jinping, praising China's help with efforts to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear threats. Xi, most probably, does not believe a word of that. He has no illusion about who the adversary is. He was busy last week inspecting naval assets, exhorting his elite marine troops to get ready to defend China and exchanging messages of \"strategic coordination\" with his real friend at the Kremlin. Investment thoughts With an expected $320 billion euro surplus on goods trade \u2014 or a $340 billion euro surplus on goods and services transactions \u2014 by the end of this year, Germany has a particular responsibility to stop living off its trade partners by generating more growth from its household consumption, residential investments, business investments and public sector expenditures (i.e., major components of domestic demand). That would stimulate more foreign sales into German markets, and it would lead to higher growth and employment creation in other EU countries. The U.S. is exerting pressure on Germany to implement that policy change, while the Europeans are looking on in a perverse solidarity with a country taking 164.4 billion euros of their purchasing power. Washington has an unassailable trade case, but its ineffective policy approach is likely to cause a train wreck with plenty of damages for everybody around. The NATO summit in Brussels next month could be the last chance to raise the trade problem to the highest political level, to calm things down and work out an agenda for balancing the trans-Atlantic trade accounts in a friendly, expeditious and orderly manner. Don't hold your breath for that. Sadly, the opportunity may well slip away. Washington needs peace and rapid improvement in its trade accounts with China, the EU and Japan at the time when accelerating inflation will keep pushing up interest rates, causing losses in asset markets and damping the economy's forward momentum.

The irony of the Comcast-Disney battle to buy the majority of 21st Century Fox is that CEOs Brian Roberts and Bob Iger could both walk away happy. All they'd have to do is split up Fox. And yet, it doesn't look like that's going to happen. Disney wants Fox's movie studio and owned content properties to boost a digital streaming service that Iger plans to launch in 2019. \"The aim of this combined company is to create even more high-quality content and then to distribute it in ways that consumers prefer and consumers demand in today's world,\" Iger told CNBC in December. show chapters Billionaire investor Mario Gabelli on the brewing Fox-Disney bidding war 9:03 AM ET Fri, 15 June 2018 | 03:29 Comcast, on the other hand, is most interested in acquiring Fox's international assets \u2014 European telecommunications company Sky and Indian media conglomerate Star India. Here's what Roberts said on a call with Comcast investors on June 13: \"We firmly believe that that the truly great media companies of the next century will be large, integrated entities with multiple growth engines across a wide swath of the global entertainment industry. And we believe our proposed acquisition of Fox would not only enhance our domestic positions in distribution and content, but would take us to global reach and additional growth in these businesses.\" It doesn't take a fission scientist to come up with a solution \u2014 Comcast takes the international assets and Disney takes the domestic ones. And if both Comcast and Disney want Hulu, they can halve Fox's 30 percent ownership. But it may be too late. There are no talks between the two companies about splitting Fox, according to people familiar with the matter. That's because Disney had no need to invite Comcast to split the assets when it reached a deal with Fox last year. But Judge Richard Leon's ruling on Wednesday that AT&T could buy Time Warner without conditions changed the calculus. Now Comcast has overbid Disney by about $9 billion (based on today's movement in Disney shares) for the same Fox assets. If Iger wants to avoid a bidding war and split the assets now, Fox would need to release him from the companies' signed deal agreement. That's unlikely to happen, because it could prevent Fox from getting the highest price for the assets it wants to sale \u2014 a bidding war is just fine for Fox shareholders. Getty Images Rupert Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer of News Corp. So even though both companies want Fox's assets for different reasons, and are willing to divest similar unwanted parts like regional sports networks, both companies are now fighting for the whole bundle of assets, including cable stations FX and Nat Geo and Endemol Shine Group. There are personal relationships at play here, too. Don't forget that Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004, and the Disney board wouldn't talk to Roberts about his $54 billion offer. And the CEO of Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, Steve Burke, worked for Disney from 1986 to 1998, including a tenure directly with Iger after Disney bought Capital Cities/ABC. The two companies have very similar market valuations, with Comcast at around $148 billion and Disney at $158 billion. Whichever company succeeds at buying Fox will become the dominant force in media. Disney is actively considering its options, including an increased cash-stock offer, according to a person familiar with the matter. Given the stakes and the personalities involved, don't expect either company to back down without a fight. A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment. A Disney spokeswoman couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the difference between Comcast and Disney's bid because it didn't properly account for the change in Disney's share price on Friday.

After the conclusion Wednesday of its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee, through the so-called dot plot of individual members' expectations, indicated that it would increase rates two more times before 2018 ends. That would come on top of the quarter-point rate increase the committee approved at the meeting, as well as one already enacted in March. While the more aggressive tilt normally would trigger a corresponding move in the fed funds futures market, where contracts for the central bank's benchmark rate are traded, the response was minimal. As of Friday afternoon, traders were implying just a 55 percent chance of a fourth hike in December \u2014 a little better than a coin flip and just 10 percentage points or so above the chances before the meeting and the surprise dot-plot change. There are multiple reasons why the market is not buying into a more hawkish Fed. Primarily, they center on the belief that the central bank will have limited room to move considering the dovish position of many of its global counterparts. There also are fears that a Fed that is too hawkish could invert the curve on government bond yields and signal a recession. Yuri Gripas | Reuters Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell prepares to testify before a Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress; on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 1, 2018. \"I was of the view that the Fed will and should only go twice. Based on the recent data, it looks like the third hike is hard to argue against,\" said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. \"I just don't see the Fed being able to go as much as they want given where the curve is and the dots are. If the Fed hikes four times this year, the curve is going to invert in December.\" \"Maybe they ignore that, maybe it doesn't mean anything, but that would trouble me,\" he added. The rate increase came as Fed officials gave the economy high marks, though it took just one member to move his or her dot higher on the chart to tilt the median toward another hike. Chairman Jerome Powell said that while the Fed is \"not ready to declare victory\" on its price stability mandate, he added that growth looks strong and able to support the central bank's continued march back toward normalization. The committee kept its benchmark rate anchored near zero for seven years until beginning to hike in December 2015. Wednesday's move pushes the target range for the rate to 1.75 percent to 2 percent. \"The economy has strengthened so much since I've joined the Fed,\" Powell told reporters at a post-meeting news conference. \"Really, the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape, growth is strong, the labor market is strong, inflation is close to target. That's what you're seeing.\" Still, traders were moved only a little by Powell's optimism. Two more hikes would translate to a target funds rate of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. But traders implied a 2.19 percent funds rate by December, which would get close to but fall short of the Fed's intentions. What will matter between now and then is data \u2014 how much more progress the economy makes toward a 2 percent inflation rate, and whether wage pressures will build that also would compel the Fed to act. On the other hand, continued unrest in emerging markets and signs that the U.S. bank is getting out of step with the pace of its global counterparts could give officials pause. Some economists believe the market's skepticism about a more aggressive Fed is ill-founded. \"From the data we look at, there is every reason to believe the economy will more than justify the Fed's proposed trajectory for policy rates,\" Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, said in a note to clients. \"The trajectory for higher policy rates is in place.

Grogan | CNBC Jason Mudrick, Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. speaking at Delivering Alpha in New York on Sept. 13, 2016. A growing number of US hedge funds specializing in distressed debt are raising money in anticipation that the next economic downturn will punish companies that have borrowed record amounts since the financial crisis. Jason Mudrick, founder of $1.9bn Mudrick Capital, is marketing a second distressed investment fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The new fund will lock up investors' money for five years and only charge fees once the capital commitment is invested, according to the people. The fundraising is set to close on December 1. Distressed debt investors make money buying assets they believe have fallen too sharply in price, typically during periods of economic stress. However, recent years have offered slimmer pickings as yields on junk-rated debt stay low and US stocks remain near record highs. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. \"This economy is roaring right now,\" said Mr. Mudrick, who declined to comment directly on the fundraising, citing US regulation. \"It's rocking and rolling. But that's just not sustainable . . . My job is not to predict exactly when [the turn in the cycle] happens but to have the platform ready when it does.\" US corporate bond sales have run at more than $1tn annually since 2009, prompting warnings that such reliance on debt will help trigger the next downturn. A widely tracked index of bonds rated below \"investment grade\" has jumped from $728bn in 2008 to more than $1.2tn this year. That amount will rise if higher-rated companies are downgraded during a downturn. Mudrick Capital is not the only fund preparing for an eventual downturn in a US economy where growth is accelerating this quarter. Strategic Value Partners in May raised almost $3bn to pounce on distressed bonds and loans, while Sheru Chowdhry, formerly co-portfolio manager of the Paulson Credit Opportunities fund, launched DSC Meridian Capital at the start of June. In total, seven distressed debt funds have raised money this year, with a record average size of $2.2bn, according to data from Preqin. The largest is the GSO Capital Solutions Fund III, which closed in April after drumming up $7.4bn in the fourth-biggest distressed debt fundraising ever. \"I think we'll be doing a lot of distressed stuff when there's distressed stuff to do,\" said Mr. Chowdhry. \"It feels like we're about 12 months away, but we could get into extended innings.\" Mr. Mudrick believes it is a backdrop that will create ripe conditions for distressed debt investors when economic conditions do worsen. The New York-based fund generated returns of almost 40 per cent in 2016 wagering that energy bonds hit by a declining oil price would recover, according to a hedge fund performance document produced by HSBC and seen by the Financial Times. Putri Pascualy, senior credit strategist at investment firm Paamco, said her firm had seen an uptick in fundraisings for distressed debt funds after falling out of favor in recent years.\"There's been a sense that valuation has been stretched for too long, coupled with macroeconomic concern,\" she said.

Bitcoin, the most popular digital coin and largest by market cap, was priced around $6,400 on Friday \u2014 a staggering decline from its December highs of around $19,500. But cryptocurrency is still a relatively new industry, and while all eyes are on bitcoin, Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, said there are other digital coins that investors might want to consider. \"Just remember,\" Kelly said on \"Fast Money\" Friday. \"Myspace existed well before Facebook. Tech disrupts itself. So, just because you have bitcoin today doesn't mean in 10 or 15 years bitcoin is going to be the leader.\" In fact, he said the next big thing in crypto might be ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform. \"Relative value-wise, ethereum has been trading a little bit better than bitcoin,\" Kelly said. \"I would overweight ethereum at this point.\" Here's why. 1. Ethereum futures Kelly pointed out that after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission determined that ethereum was not a security, the president of Cboe Global Markets said that was also a hurdle for launching ethereum futures. \"So one would think, perhaps, ethereum futures are not far off,\" he said. \"They already have an ethereum index.\" 2. The augur platform The augur platform, one of the oldest ICOs, has been in development for about two or three years, Kelly said. \"It's a decentralized prediction market,\" he said. \"What's interesting about this [is that] this will probably be one of the biggest decentralized apps on top of ethereum.\" \"If [augur] doesn't slow the system down, that can generally be a positive for ethereum,\" Kelly said. 3. Software mining Kelly said ethereum is upgrading. \"They [will] go from hardware mining, proof of work, to something called 'proof of stake,' which is similar to a software mining,\" he said. He said in the next couple of months this will start to take effect and have an impact on ethereum.

He anticipates real gross-domestic-product growth will hit 4.5 percent in the second quarter. On top of that there is a tight labor market, with the unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, and inflation is picking up. \"It is too good, and that's kind of the problem,\" said Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker is now forecasting second-quarter GDP may hit 4.8 percent. \"A big part of this stock market, when it did the best was when Main Street was not doing the best. We had a lot of excess slack, and you could grow the economy and not create any cost pressures, any interest rate pressures, any inflation pressures,\" Paulsen said on \"Power Lunch.\" There was also no need for the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy, he added. Now, there is a completely different situation. \"Good growth is no longer good for financial assets outright,\" Paulsen explained. \"It does raise profits, but it also raises the interest rate pressures, the cost pressures, the pressure of profit margins. It forces the Fed to restrict the money supply and liquidity conditions. And we're dealing with all that.\" The Fed began gradually raising interest rates in December 2016. Earlier this week, it again hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point and expects two more increases this year. The central bank also began to unwind its balance sheet late last year. Meanwhile, even if the U.S. economic growth slows to 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent for the second half of the year, it is enough to push wages and inflation higher, Paulsen said. \"Weaker growth may cause some to question their earnings estimates for the year but it won't be enough to stop the Fed from maybe having to lift rates or the bond vigilante from having yields going higher,\" he said. \"That to me is a much bigger challenge than trade war,\" said Paulsen. The term bond vigilante was coined by market historian Ed Yardeni in the 1980s. It refers to investors who sell their holdings in an effort to enforce fiscal discipline. Having fewer buyers drives prices down \u2014 and drives yields up \u2014 in the fixed-income market. That, in turn, makes it more expensive for the government to borrow and spend. show chapters Stocks slide on more trade war worries. Time to buy? 2:40 PM ET Fri, 15 June 2018 | 04:56 On Friday, the stock market slashed losses from earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 280 points but ultimately ended just 84.83 points lower at 25,090.48. The morning drop came after the Trump administration said it would impose a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion in Chinese goods. China later announced retaliatory tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods. However, David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management, also thinks there is more to the market action than trade war anxiety. \"Not only is the market reacting to trade fears about trade policy and the potential impact on the economy, but this is coming in the midst of significant monetary policy tightening,\" he told \"Power Lunch.\" \"Investors are thinking, 'OK, we've got potential economic slowdowns.

At a time when most economists have substantially boosted their outlooks for GDP gains, particularly in the second quarter, the central bank official cautioned that the enthusiasm could be misplaced. \"I began the year with a decided upside tilt to my risk profile for growth, reflecting business optimism following the passage of tax reform. However, that optimism has almost completely faded among my contacts, replaced by concerns about trade policy and tariffs,\" Bostic said during a speech in Savannah, Georgia, according to prepared remarks. The White House has been in a battle against China as well as multiple other trading partners as President Donald Trump seeks to reduce the difference between imports and exports. The administration has leveled tariffs against imported steel and aluminum and a slew of other prospects, with China in particular retaliating. In addition, the president has threatened to pull the U.S. out of NAFTA in favor of seeking unilateral agreements. Financial markets have been volatile as the trade tensions have grown, and Bostic said that fear is flowing over into the broader economy. \"Perceived uncertainty has risen markedly,\" he said. \"Projects already under way are continuing, but I get the sense that the bar for new investment is currently quite high. 'Risk off' behavior appears to be the dominant sentiment among my contacts.\" Bostic also said he agrees with the 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike the Federal Open Market Committee approved last week, though he said he's not sure about the path of increases ahead. He said he does not seen signs of aggressive wage growth, with companies opting to train their own workers and investing in automation rather than hiring new employees at higher pay. \"We want to ensure that the economy is not overheating, but we also do not want monetary policy to become too restrictive and threaten to choke off the expansion,\" Bostic said.

Vullo said in a statement. Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, already holds a money-transmitter license from the department. TWEET The app launched in 2015 and is growing at a faster rate than PayPal's Venmo, according to Nomura Instinet. Since early 2016, downloads on Square Cash app downloads averaged 128 percent year-over-year growth each month versus Venmo's 74 percent growth, according to Nomura. The department approval could boost already rapidly-growing downloads, and expand what users can do with the Cash app, Dolev said. \"This announcement gives people another excuse to download the app,\" he said, adding that it might not move the bottom line right away but \"definitely helps from a marketing perspective.\" Shares of the company have surged 88 percent this year, and hit a record around $65 Monday, up more than 2 percent on the day. The fintech company had 7 million active customers on its money-transfer app in December alone, Square said in its recent quarterly letter to shareholders. Many of those customers have been using the Cash app more like a bank account than the company intended, Dorsey said in May. While that wasn't a goal, Dorsey said Square plans to \"lean into\" the trend, and has already signaled plans to break into banking. Square filed for an FDIC license to be an industrial loan company in Utah, American Banker reported in September. The license would allow it to perform some of the same services as banks, including issuing loans without having to rely on a bank to originate them and without having to get licenses in each state. Square is the ninth firm approved for cryptocurrency trading in New York. The Department of Financial Services has also granted licenses to companies like Coinbase and Circle and has granted charters to Gemini Trust and Paxos, formerly known as itBit Trust. The so-called BitLicense has been notoriously difficult to get, and New York is considered one of the strictest states when it comes to regulating cryptocurrency firms.

By revenue, chipmakers face the greatest risks in escalating trade tensions with Beijing. Among U.S. industries, semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52 percent, Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a June 12 report. Chipmaker Qualcomm has 65 percent revenue exposure to China, and optical components manufacturer Lumentum has 23 percent exposure, the report said in a list of 20 stocks most sensitive to China. Source: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Research Estimates U.S. stock indexes fell sharply after a renewed war of words over tariffs between the Trump administration and Beijing. Telecommunications equipment maker Lumentum skidded 4.9 percent Tuesday morning, and shares of major chipmakers tumbled. Qualcomm and Micron fell more than 1.5 percent, while Intel dropped more than 2 percent. Broadcom fell about 2.3 percent, and Skyworks Solutions traded 2.2 percent lower. Last week, the Trump administration said 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect July 6. Beijing quickly retaliated with duties on $34 billion worth of American goods that will also go into effect July 6. If China does not change its practices and goes through with the tariffs, the U.S. will impose more tariffs, President Donald Trump said late Monday. He has asked the United States Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs of 10 percent. Beijing responded by saying China will protect its interests. China's list of tariffs released Friday primarily covered agricultural products and automobiles. The Morgan Stanley analysts also pointed out in the report that semiconductors are components of products sold elsewhere, so negative impact from the high revenue exposure to China \"is not as meaningful\" as it might be in other industries.

When their concerns showed up on the conference screen, these words were the most popular: Trump, trade war and protectionism. Outside, meanwhile, the stock market was having another up day. In recent weeks, against the expectations of many on Wall Street, investors have not run for the exits as President Trump has stepped up trade brawls with China, Canada and the European Union. On Friday, when the Trump administration and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of goods from each country, the Standard & Poor's 500 index finished barely lower. The index has gained 2 percent since the end of February, when Mr. Trump began to take action on trade in earnest, and it remains up 30 percent since his election in November 2016. More from the New York Times: Why the Fed tweaked an obscure interest rate this week Google, rebuilding its presence in China, invests in retailer JD.com CEOs think the Kim meeting was a bad deal for Trump Why have the markets held up when the prospect of a trade war unnerves many on Wall Street? The United States economy appears to be a picture of health and corporate earnings are surging. That seems to have investors betting that the collateral damage will be manageable. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta predicted that the United States economy could grow at 4.8 percent rate in the second quarter, which would be the second-highest quarterly growth rate in the past decade. Unemployment is at multiyear lows, retail sales are strong, consumer confidence is high and the inflation rate remains relatively subdued. This strong run could continue if tax cuts for businesses and consumers prompt higher spending. And, most important to investors, companies' earnings are set to rise at their fastest pace since the years immediately following the financial crisis. Wall Street analysts expect the profits of companies in the S.&P. 500 to surge 26 percent this year, after a 17 percent rise last year. Rising profits might explain why investors are putting more money in the United States stock market while getting out of other countries. In the past six weeks, a net $29 billion has poured into funds that invest in United States stocks, while $13 billion flowed out of those focused on European stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At the start of this year, analysts expected solid growth around the world, but now Europe's economy is showing signs of weakness, and turbulence has returned to the markets of some developing countries. But there are few signs in the United States that anxiety about trade is causing a significant pullback in business spending. \"We really don't see it in the numbers,\" Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week. \"It's just not there.\" Economists are not forecasting big hits to the United States economy from the trade policies either in effect or imminent. Goldman Sachs's economists predicted that the $50 billion of tariffs against China would shave no more than two-tenths of a percentage point off gross domestic product after two years. Investors may also believe that this period of high tension and tariff threats are the prelude to some sort of deal. The decision to extend a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese electronics firm subject to United States penalties, showed that the Trump administration and its Chinese counterparts are capable of agreement. Of course, the trade battles could escalate instead. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose an additional $100 billion of tariffs on China, which would most likely retaliate with its own tariffs. That would do more economic damage and cause some nervy days in the stock market, but not necessarily calamity, said Brad W. Setser, a fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Countries, he said, have ways to soften the blow. \"You would start to see some real disruption and higher short-term costs but not the sort of costs that would trigger a recession\" in either the United States or China, he said. Still, there are signs of fear lurking in the stock market. The S.&P. 500 remains below its peak hit in January, and some analysts say the trade tensions may be holding it back. \"Why hasn't the overall market made a new high considering all the fiscal stimulus?\" David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said. Stocks of technology companies and smaller companies have done particularly well in recent weeks, indicating that investors right now are drawn to companies that are less vulnerable to trade wars, Mr. Rosenberg added. Also, it is too early to conclude that the United States can mostly shrug off trade battles. Many American businesses have operations abroad or get a large share of their revenue from foreign markets. The retaliation by other countries has barely begun. Tariffs push up the costs for businesses, which in turns crimps their profits. If companies start to warn that profits will come in below expectations because of trade, the stock markets in the United States could decline sharply. Home-building companies provide an example of what might happen. United States homebuilders face a range of rising costs. One of them is they have to pay more for Canadian softwood lumber after the Trump administration imposed tariffs of 20 percent on that product last year. The Standard & Poor's index for stocks in home-building companies is more than 10 percent below its recent peak. The United States economy could start to disappoint. Interest rates are rising, in part, because the United States federal government is borrowing large sums to cover the fiscal shortfall that resulted from the recent tax cuts. Higher interest rates can quickly crimp growth.

Worries about a U.S.-China trade war hit global markets Tuesday, following a war of words between the Trump administration and Beijing. It has been a journey of more than two years for the White House's efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which rose to $375.2 billion in 2017 from $347 billion in 2016. Here's a rundown of key events up to this point: May 2, 2016: During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump compared the U.S. trade deficit with China to \"rape.\" June 28, 2016: Trump laid out seven steps on trade to bring back American jobs, including labeling China a currency manipulator on day one in the White House and using \"every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes.\" Those tactics included tariffs. Nov. 2016 - Jan. 2017: Trump won the U.S. presidential election, then selected known China hawks for key positions on trade. Peter Navarro, author of \"Death by China,\" was named head a newly formed National Trade Council. Robert Lighthizer, who previously negotiated restrictions on steel imports and was deputy U.S. trade representative during the Reagan administration, was named U.S. Trade Representative. April 7, 2017: Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The two-day summit ended on friendly terms. Xi agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks to increase U.S. exports and reduce the deficit with China, as well as increase cooperation on limiting North Korea's nuclear threat. April 12, 2017: Trump told The Wall Street Journal he will not label China a currency manipulator in the Treasury Department's forthcoming report. Aug. 18, 2017: At Trump's direction, the U.S. Trade Representative began its \"Section 301\" investigation into \"China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation.\" March 8, 2018: Trump signed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent duties on aluminum, citing national security. Canada and Mexico are initially exempt. March 22, 2018: Following the conclusion of the Section 301 investigation, Trump announced plans for tariffs, a settlement in a World Trade Organization dispute and investment restrictions on China. April 1, 2018: China increased the tariff rate on pork products and aluminum scrap by 25 percent. Beijing also imposed a 15 percent tariff on 120 other U.S. commodities ranging from almonds to apples. The duties took effect that week. April 3, 2018: The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a proposed list of tariffs on roughly $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, including products used for robotics, information technology, communications and aerospace. The approximately 1,300 product lines will be open for public comment before any duties are imposed. April 4, 2018: China's Ministry of Commerce released its own tariff list covering 106 U.S. products, including soybeans, beef, corn, some aircraft and a range of vehicles. There was no effective date for the tariffs, designed to address $50 billion worth of U.S. goods. April 5, 2018: Trump said he has asked the U.S. Trade Representative to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs against China. April 6, 2018: China's Ministry of Commerce said if the U.S. goes through with those tariffs, Beijing is prepared to fight back immediately. April 10, 2018: China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization about Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. On the same day, Xi spokebroadly about China's plans to increase imports, lower tariffs on automobile imports, open up its financial services industry to foreigners and step up intellectual property protection. The speech at the Boao Forum for Asia did not directly address the trade dispute with the U.S., and did not cover new areas of reform. Trump said in a tweet he was \"very thankful\" for Xi's \"kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers.\" April 16, 2018: The U.S. Commerce Department banned Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE from buying U.S. components for seven years, saying the company has violated a settlement reached over illegal shipments to Iran and North Korea. Trading in ZTE shares was subsequently halted in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. May 13, 2018: Trump tweeted that he and Xi are working together to help ZTE \"get back into business, fast\" since there are \"too many jobs in China lost.\" Earlier in the month, the company said it had to halt its main operations as a result of U.S. actions. May 18, 2018: China announced it is ending an anti-dumping investigation into U.S. sorghum imports. Earlier in the day, U.S. officials familiar with trade talks said Beijing was offering a package to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by up to $200 billion, according to Reuters and other media. China's Foreign Ministry subsequently said the reports were not true. May 19, 2018: In a joint statement, the U.S. and China agreed to \"meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports\" and \"significant\" increases in U.S. goods and services overall. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer led a delegation that met in Washington, D.C., with the Chinese, led by State Council Vice Premier Liu He. May 20, 2018: The trade war is \"on hold,\" Mnuchin told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,\" he said. May 22, 2018: China said it will lower tariffs on automobile imports to 15 percent, from 25 percent. The new rate will be effective July 1. But Trump said that same day he is \"not satisfied\" with last week's trade talks with China and that the negotiations are only a \"start.\" May 23, 2018: Trump tweeted that trade talks with China will probably have to go in a new direction in order to near a resolution. May 29, 2018: Trump said in a statement on the White House website the U.S. will go ahead with 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, highlighting products related to the \"Made in China 2025\" program. The final list of tariffs was set for release by June 15. May 31, 2018: Ahead of Commerce Secretary Ross' visit, China announced it will cut tariffs on July 1 for 1,449 product lines. But the items were mostly irrelevant to trade with the U.S., analysts tell The New York Times. June 4, 2018: Ross concluded meetings in Beijing with no specific agreement on trade. The two sides spoke generally about reducing the U.S. deficit by increasing supply of agriculture and energy products to China, according to a White House statement. Beijing is willing to increase imports from the U.S. and other countries, but all outcomes of the trade negotiations will not take effect if the U.S. imposes tariffs, according to a statement from the Chinese side published by the state-run newspaper Xinhua. June 6, 2018: Chinese negotiators proposed a package valued at nearly $70 billion in first-year purchases, if the Trump administration would step back from tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The proposal included increased Chinese purchases of soybeans, corn, natural gas, crude oil and coal, the Journal said. June 7, 2018: ZTE settled with the U.S. to pay up to $1.4 billion for violating a March 2017 agreement. Until it makes the payment, the Chinese telecom equipment company remains banned from buying from U.S. components. June 12, 2018: ZTE shares plunged more than 40 percent in Hong Kong after trading resumed following a near two-month halt. June 15, 2018: The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a list of 1,102 Chinese imports worth about $50 billion. A 25 percent tariff on 818 of these items, valued at about $34 billion, will take effect July 6. The other 284 products, worth about $16 billion, will undergo a public comment process before a final decision on implementation. China responded with its own list of 545 U.S. imports worth roughly $34 billion that will be subject to a 25 percent tariff beginning July 6. These products include soybeans, electric vehicles, a range of hybrid electric vehicles and a variety of seafood. Aircraft was not on the list. Beijing also said will impose tariffs at an unspecified later date on an additional 114 U.S. goods including crude oil, diesel and magnetic resonance imaging kits. Altogether, the two lists covered 659 U.S. goods, worth $50 billion. June 18, 2018: The U.S. Senate passed a military funding bill with a provision that reimposes a ban on ZTE buying components from U.S. companies. The House of Representatives' version of the bill, which passed in May, did not include the ZTE provision. While a committee works out the differences, the White House can still push for changes. In the evening, Trump said he has directed the U.S. Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for an additional 10 percent tariff. These duties will take effect if China does not change its practices and goes through with the tariffs it has announced, according to a statement on the White House's website. China's Commerce Ministry said the U.S. \"has initiated a trade war\" and that China will protect its interests.

could deliver solid profits as stocks \u2018reset\u2019 4:04 PM ET Thu, 14 June 2018 | 02:17 The bull market is entering a new phase, but PNC Financial's Jeffrey Mills believes that's no reason to get negative on stocks. In an interview on CNBC's \"Futures Now,\" the firm's co-chief investment strategist acknowledged it will be hard to replicate last year's record gains. He referred to 2018 as a \"reset year\" as stocks retrace. \"The market is catching its breath,\" Mills said Thursday. \"There's going to be a continued push and pull between strong fundamentals. So, we have solid growth [and] really good earnings, but then multiples that have come down.\" Despite his prediction of a near-term market pause, Mills doesn't think investors should get overly defensive. He listed energy as a top play in this environment. \"I would tactically use this weakness if you are underweight energy to start to add. It looks like the commodity is starting to firm here around $66 [a barrel.] It was overbought, so we're consolidating here,\" he said. Mills also favors financials, a group that's down about 2 percent so far this year. \"We continue to like the banks. We don't think it's as much as a rising rates story as it is a deregulation and loan growth story,\" he said. As for the rest of the market, he isn't waving a white flag. Mills is confident the S&P 500 Index will stay above flatline this year. Right now, it's up nearly 4 percent in 2018. \"Reset year to me means probably the worst-case scenario isn't that bad, but the best-case scenario isn't that good. So, I'm thinking something in the 4 to 7 percent total return range,\" Mills said. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

For any form of money to work across large networks it requires trust in the stability of its value and in its ability to scale efficiently, the BIS, an umbrella group for the world's central banks, said in its annual report. But trust can disappear instantly because of the fragility of the decentralized networks on which cryptocurrencies depend, the BIS said. Those networks are also prone to congestion the bigger they become, according to the BIS, which noted the high transaction fees of the best-known digital currency, bitcoin, and the limited number of transactions per second they can handle. \"Trust can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralized consensus through which transactions are recorded,\" the Switzerland-based group said in its report. \"Not only does this call into question the finality of individual payments, it also means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value.\" The BIS' head of research, Hyun Song Shin, said sovereign money had value because it had users, but many people holding cryptocurrencies did so often purely for speculative purposes. \"Without users, it would simply be a worthless token. That's true whether it's a piece of paper with a face on it, or a digital token,\" he said, comparing virtual coins to baseball cards or Tamagotchi. show chapters SEC chairman on cryptocurrencies and investing 11:08 AM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 | 14:56 The dependency of users on so-called miners to record and verify crypto transactions is also flawed, according to the BIS, requiring vast and costly energy use. It has issued a series of warnings this year after an explosive rise in cryptocurrency values attracted a wave of followers. Agustin Carstens, general manager of the BIS, has described bitcoin as \"a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster\". The BIS has told central banks to think hard about the potential risks before issuing their own cryptocurrencies. No central bank has issued a digital currency, though the Riksbank in Sweden, where the use of cash has fallen, is studying a retail e-krona for small payments. The BIS also said in its annual report that effective regulation of digital coins needed to be global, targeting both regulated financial institutions as well as companies offering crypto-related services.

Verizon was the only member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading significantly into the green on Tuesday. The gains came after Deutsche Bank upgraded the wireless provider, saying the shares were relatively cheap. The stock closed 2.2 percent higher Tuesday, also boosted by investors betting that its domestic revenues will be shielded from fears of a trade war hitting the broader market. Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Procter & Gamble and Travelers traded slightly higher for a similar reason, but none had the gains of Verizon. Deutsche Bank upped its rating for Verizon to buy, and increased its price target to $56, roughly $8 above where the stock was trading Tuesday. Verizon is trading at a discount compared with its telecom peers, Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. His 12-month price target implies 23 percent total return from current levels. Niknam highlighted improving financial health in the overall U.S. wireless market and said Verizon, the nation's largest carrier, is set to benefit from investors' confidence. \"Wireless fundamentals are meaningfully improving, following a heightened wave of aggressive competitive activity in recent years,\" Niknam said. Consolidation in the market, most recently with T-Mobile and Sprint's plans to merge, \"could be viewed favorably by investors when considering the longer-term health of the U.S. Wireless market,\" Niknam said. Still, the bank said rising interest rates have historically been a headwind for telecoms like Verizon. Deutsche Bank macroeconomists expect the 10-year Treasury yield to hit 3.5 percent by the end of 2018. Yields were around 2.92 Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 300 points at the open Tuesday, erasing all of its gains for the year. The 30-stock index was dragged down by Boeing and Caterpillar, which are considered to be bellwethers for trade tensions. President Donald Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs and Monday night said if China \"refuses to change its practices\" and continues with its own newly declared tariffs, then the additional levies would be imposed on Beijing. In response, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said the latest threat of more tariffs violates previous negotiations and Washington \"has initiated a trade war that violates market laws and is not in accordance with current global development trends.\" Shares of Verizon have fallen about 8.5 percent this year, and were trading above $48 Tuesday.

With Tuesday's late morning sell-off, soybean prices are now more than 17 percent lower for the quarter and down more than 10 percent for the year. Corn futures tumbled to their lowest price in more than six months. Wheat and oat futures fell roughly 1.4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, while rough rice futures were mildly lower. \"The dramatic drop today is soybeans because soybeans is first and foremost what the Chinese like to buy from us,\" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group. More than half of U.S. soybeans go to China, the world's largest consumer of the beans. If Beijing imposed a 10 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans, total American soybean exports could drop by 18 percent, according to a study for the U.S. Soybean Export Council by Purdue University agricultural economists Wally Tyner and Farzad Taheripour. If China implemented a 30 percent tariff, total U.S. soybean exports could fall 40 percent, according to the study, released in late March. Prices would fall 2 or 5 percent over a few years, respectively, under the two different scenarios, the analysis said. In addition to negative sentiment around the trade dispute, Flynn attributed the drop in soybean prices to dollar strength, which makes U.S. goods relatively more expensive overseas. The U.S. dollar index rose about 0.3 percent Tuesday and is up 5.5 percent this quarter. \"I think ultimately the world is going to buy our beans,\" Flynn said. \"The demand is there. People have to eat. The decrease in price may offset the fact there might be a tariff.\" ", "author": "J.B.

Several of the most successful investors in the world predicted the two economic superpowers will eventually reach a deal after some short-term saber rattling. Trade tensions with China rose to new highs Monday when President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. trade representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent. show chapters Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon on the US economy 8:39 AM ET Thu, 7 June 2018 | 06:40 The move sparked a nearly 300-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday due to trade war fears. But billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, the hedge fund manager who called the October 1987 crash, downplayed the possibility of a trade war last week. \"I would call it more of a trade irritant than a real trade problem,\" Jones told CNBC in a \"Squawk Box\" interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on June 12. \"You have to put things in perspective, right? If we just look at our four biggest trading partners they have a simple weighted average tariff of about 6 percent, we have one of 3\u00bd percent. So there is a 2\u00bd percent gap in unfairness.\" The investor said if Trump is trying to \"normalize the tariffs\" to match our trading partners, the market impact will be limited. Instead Jones actually predicted the stock market could go \"crazy\" to the upside into the end of the year. He noted that he is closely watching the situation in case his assessment is incorrect and the trade conflict becomes something much worse. In similar fashion, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that he's not worried yet about the escalating trade conflict between the U.S. and China. \"Right now, this is not serious,\" he said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I'm waiting for something serious to hit my way.\" Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein agreed the blustery trade rhetoric will not lead to financial disaster. \"I don't think we're in a suicide pact on this. So I suspect that we're not going to cause the economies to collapse,\" he said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York. \"This is part of a negotiating pattern.\" Perhaps the most successful investor in history also said the two countries will find an acceptable compromise. Last month, Warren Buffett said he was optimistic the U.S. and China will avoid a serious trade conflict because countries eventually do what it is in their best economic interests. \"I don't think either country will dig themselves into something that precipitates and continues any kind of real trade war,\" he said at the Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual shareholders meeting on May 5. \"There will be some back and forth, but in the end I don't think we'll come out with a terrible answer on it \u2026 [Trade] benefits are huge and the world's dependent on it in a major way for its progress that two intelligent countries [won't] do something extremely foolish.\" ", "author": "David A.

Despite the dominance of large technology companies in the stock market's gains over the last year, small company stocks are forecast to do better if trade war fears come to pass. Small company stocks have already been outperforming the broad market because of tax cuts and regulatory reform. The iShares ETF tracking the Russell 2000 small-cap index is up 9.3 percent this year compared to the 2.8 percent gain for the S&P 500 and the 0.3 percent drop in the large-cap Dow Jones industrial average. In a note on Tuesday, J. P. Morgan analysts recommended investors continue to overweight small-cap stocks, seeing them as shielded from the escalating risk of a trade war and U.S. dollar volatility, both of which affect revenue and profit at larger companies with multinational operations. \"We continue to recommend Small-caps as a 'catch-all trade' for its high cyclical, reflation and tax policy exposures, as well as lower sensitivity to ongoing trade risk,\" Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, J. P. Morgan's equity strategist, wrote in the note. Among the iShares small-cap IWM ETF top holdings are GrubHub, an internet food ordering service, which is up 59 percent this year, Exact Sciences Corp., a cancer diagnostics company, up 31 percent, and Aspen Technology, a software maker, up 44.7 percent. These stocks were not mentioned in the J. P. Morgan note. Small cap stocks benefit because they are more exposed exclusively to the still-growing U.S. economy, show stronger growth trends and have the potential for M&A activity. Large global companies have exposure to Europe and emerging markets, where economic forecasts are being revised lower and financial conditions are tightening. Small companies are also seen benefiting from tax reform and deregulation, the effects of which haven't been completely reflected in their stocks. They got almost twice the benefit as large companies from the tax cut in the first quarter, the analysts noted. And domestic companies could get a bigger share of the windfall from individual tax cuts, averaging around $1,500 a household. But merger activity could also boost small-cap stocks. Large companies brought a lot of cash back to the U.S. after the tax cuts, and that cash is expected to be used in part for deals. Small and mid-sized companies are the potential targets, given new growth opportunities and reduced concern about regulatory issues preventing deals from going through. Small-caps stocks would be risky if interest rates spiked sharply higher or if there was significantly higher wage growth, because they are more sensitive to labor costs, J. P. Morgan said. A weaker U.S. dollar could also hit small caps, as could declining support for a pro-growth agenda in Washington.

from the bank stress test results this week 5:04 PM ET Mon, 18 June 2018 | 05:20 The big bank stocks aren't having a great year, but there are plenty of opportunities in the banking sector if investors look beyond the largest names, noted analyst Dick Bove told CNBC on Monday. Citigroup is down more than 10 percent for the year and Goldman Sachs has fallen 9 percent year to date. J.P. Morgan Chase is faring better, up just more than 1 percent, while Bank of America is down 0.41 percent. Bove believes those who focus on only the largest six banks are \"missing the whole ballgame.\" \"Banks in the mid-cap area have been soaring this year. They've been doing extraordinarily well,\" the equity research analyst at Hilton Capital Management said on \"Closing Bell.\" In fact, Bove believes the biggest banks in the nation are losing market share to their smaller competitors. In the 12-month period from March 2017 to March 2018, the four big universal banks grew their loan portfolios by 3.1 percent. Conversely, the 39 mid-cap regionals grew their loans by 15.7 percent, and 56 community banks grew their lending by 14.7 percent, he pointed out in a recent CNBC op-ed. Christopher Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, said the big banks had to work \"very hard\" to hit the first-quarter earnings numbers because \"they are not growing.\" \"The fundamental problem is they did really well last year, extraordinarily well, and it would be unreasonable to expect them to still go up \u2026 given the valuation. They're fully valued,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" Bank stocks will once again be in the spotlight when the results of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests are released later this week. Then, next week the results from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, will be announced, which pertains to banks' plans to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. The tests are a part of the post-financial crisis Dodd-Frank reforms that mandated banks raise capital levels to protect against another crisis. However, Whalen thinks the Fed is making a \"terrible, terrible\" mistake by making those results public. \"It has no value, analytically,\" he said. Meanwhile, Bove is against companies buying back their own stocks. \"The buyback programs really have significant negative impacts on banks. They may assist the stocks for a short period but they certainly didn't help the stocks in 2018,\" he said.

The two divisions \u2014 the private client group overseen by David Kowach and wealth brokerage services overseen by Jay Welker \u2014 have long overlapped. Both employ financial advisers who work with mass affluent clients. However, the businesses are organized in different channels. Wealth brokerage services, which employs brokers who work in bank branches, is in the same section of the bank as the private bank, which employs wealth managers who advise the ultra-rich. During the bank's investor day conference in March, Jon Weiss, head of wealth and investment management, said Wells Fargo is exploring ways to increase efficiency among the bank's wealth businesses. Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu wrote in an emailed statement, \"No final decisions have been made because that work continues. Whatever the outcome, we will continue to serve our clients across multiple channels \u2014 community bank branches, advisor-led branches, FiNet, online and by phone \u2014 because our clients expect that from us Wells Fargo.\" Weiss is expected to address the plans on Thursday during a town hall-style meeting with brokers.

The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite this year dropped on average at least 0.4 percent immediately after an announcement on trade policy from the U.S. or its partners, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho. The analysis takes into account six instances this year in which the Trump administration and the European Union have announced they will impose tariffs or had threatened to impose them on certain goods. Leading the major indexes lower when trade worries rise are industrials and financials, which fall at least 0.6 percent in these instances, the analysis shows. Materials are also among the biggest laggards. Large-cap industrials like Boeing and Caterpillar do a lot of business overseas, making them susceptible to rising trade tensions. Financials, meanwhile, are usually pushed down by a decline in long-term rates as investors load up on U.S. sovereign bonds in their search for safety. Late on Monday, President Donald Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs, at a rate of 10 percent. If China \"refuses to change its practices\" and insists on continuing with the new tariffs it recently declared, then the additional levies would be imposed on Beijing, Trump said. Soon after, the Chinese Commerce Ministry issued a response, stating that the latest threat of more tariffs violates previous negotiations and consensus reached between the U.S. and China. \"The United States has initiated a trade war that violates market laws and is not in accordance with current global development trends,\" the ministry said. The news rattled Wall Street, sending stocks down sharply. This, however, might be a good time to buy stocks. According to Kensho, the major averages are up at least half a percent just five trading days after the news on U.S. trade. The previous rebounds have largely been led by consumer and health-care stocks, all of which average returns of at least 1 percent. Industrials, however, still struggle five days after the initial decline, averaging a loss of 0.06 percent.

Global economies were growing in sync with each other, and that boosted optimism and business and consumer confidence. But lately that dynamic has begun to break down, with rising interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a possible trade war with China threatening to erode the situation even further, Roubini told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Tuesday. He notes that the euro zone slowed first, followed by the U.K. and Japan. \"The two key elements of global growth have remained the U.S. and China, and now the U.S. and China are on the verge of a trade war,\" he said. \"There are actually signs of a slowdown of global growth in emerging markets, and the Fed keeps on tightening. So, this is a moment of some degree of fragility.\" The U.S. rivalry with China entangles more than just soybeans and electronic components. It's about national security, technology and other issues as the world's two biggest economies square off, he said. \"It's going to get worse given this rivalry between the U.S. and China.\" Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images Nouriel Roubini Already, Trump threatened to pull the U.S. out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and antagonized key trading partners like Canada, Mexico and the EU by slapping tariffs on their steel and aluminum. Trump says he wants to rebalance what he calls unfair U.S. trade deficits. But U.S. fiscal policies like massive deficit spending during a period of economic expansion and rising interest rates are the real culprit, Roubini said. A strong dollar only makes the trade imbalance wider, which gives protectionists more ammunition to raise the ante in a spiraling situation. \"The risk is that it actually ends up [turning] into a generalized trade war between the United States and the rest of the world,\" Roubini said. \"But the problem is not that trade practices of the rest of the world are causing these trade deficits. The economic policies of the United States are behind it.\" As jobs, employment and wages are all trending positive for Trump, Roubini asked, \"Why attack China right now, at a time when the world is becoming more fragile, where the Fed is tightening, where the dollar is rising?\" All of it will lead to an economic slowdown that \"we don't want, is not desirable and we can't afford.\" ", "author": "Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/nouriel-roubini-trade-war-will-only-make-fragile-economic-conditions-worse.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Trump's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "American", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Roubini 4:24 PM ET Tue", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "19 June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "00:57", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "American", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "New York University", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Nouriel Roubini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Roubini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Closing Bell", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Japan", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Jin Lee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Nouriel", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the North American Free Trade Agreement", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "EU", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Roubini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Roubini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Roubini", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "The NYU economics professor says this is a \"moment of some degree of fragility.\"", "title": "Nouriel Roubini: Trade war will only make fragile economic conditions worse", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/12/102421776-480531081.jpg?v=1474398223"}, {"time": "2018-06-19T16:12:02-0400", "body": " show chapters Goldman Sachs CEO: 'Tit-for-tat' approach to trade negotiations is 'crazy' 2:19 PM ET Tue, 19 June 2018 | 03:08 Despite escalating trade threats between the United States and China, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein says the two countries won't mutually destroy their economies. \"I don't think we're in a suicide pact on this,\" Blankfein said during a luncheon interview at the Economic Club of New York Tuesday. \"I suspect we're not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids,\" Blankfein said, referring to the 1930s protectionist act that brought import taxes to historic levels.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group In response, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said the latest threat of more tariffs violates previous negotiations, and Washington \"has initiated a trade war that violates market laws and is not in accordance with current global development trends.\" Blankfein, who is preparing an exit from his job after a 12-year tenure as CEO, said this is part of a negotiating tactic by Trump, and it may be similar to recent talks with North Korea, which included \"a lot of bluster.\" Blankfein advocated a different approach, and said this was not the course he would have recommended. While China could run out of things to apply retaliatory tariffs to before the U.S. did, Blankfein criticized the \"tit-for-tat\" approach being used. \"That's what you would do if you're crazy and wanted to end free trade,\" he said. \"That's what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.\" While he acknowledged China is frustrated with \"sudden aggressiveness\" of U.S. policy, Blankfein was also sympathetic to U.S. companies doing business there. \"Anyone who has transacted with China has appreciated the potential of China, had good experiences and had frustrating experiences in China,\" he said. \"And at various times one or the other comes to the fore.\" Goldman Sachs was one of the first American banks to make inroads to China. In November, the investment bank established a $5 billion investment vehicle with China's sovereign wealth fund aimed at putting money into U.S. companies. At the time, Blankfein was traveling with President Donald Trump as part of a business delegation led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \"This was an early effort, symbolic in the whole scheme of trade but an important symbol of what China wanted to do to support U.S. trade,\" Blankfein said. Markets factored in the possibility of a trade escalation Tuesday.

Throughout Hollywood, the concept of an inclusion rider \u2014 a special clause in the contract of a lead actor or actress or prominent director that insists on a guarantee of gender and ethnic diversity among the cast and crew \u2014 has become increasingly popular since then. The Oscar winners Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Brie Larson have said they would insist on one, as have the director and producer Ava DuVernay and others. But what if inclusion riders took the leap from Hollywood to Wall Street?

Wall Street investment funds have a long of history of being the antithesis of diverse. Only 9 percent of senior executives in private equity are women, according to the industry research firm Preqin. Fewer than 2 percent of private equity firms are run by women. About 2 percent of all funding for venture capital went to companies with all-female founding teams, and just 12 percent to teams with at least one woman. And yet, study after study shows that firms that include women on their investment committees empirically outperform their peers. And even if the returns were simply the same, wouldn't there be a moral imperative to improve the balance? Goldman Sachs has privately been working on what might be considered a first step toward the advancement of female investment managers. The firm is working on a $500 million initiative to fund female-led investment firms using its own capital and that of its clients, according to an internal memo and people involved in the effort who were not authorized to discuss the initiative because it had not been publicly announced. The $500 million figure is small relative to the size of the asset management industry, but it could serve as a model for other initiatives. And with Goldman's name attached, it could give cautious investors more exposure and experience investing in female-led funds to drive them to do more \u2014 eventually changing the depressing statistics around women in the investment world. \"Whether these dismal numbers are due to poor sourcing, lack of supply or outright bias or some combination thereof, the end result is clear: Picture a founder or C.E.O. in your mind, and it's probably a man,\" Stephanie Cohen, a partner and chief strategy officer at Goldman who is spearheading the initiative, wrote in a memo to her colleagues. \"Investing in women entrepreneurs with great ideas will help, but it's going to take a lot more than just smartly directed dollars.\" The Goldman initiative, which will include offering seed capital for female investment managers as well as making direct investments in businesses led by female entrepreneurs, is one of a handful of such efforts that financial institutions are making. Perhaps most important: The Goldman effort is a for-profit initiative. The firm, which has used its philanthropic arm to start projects like 10,000 Women to support female entrepreneurs on a nonprofit basis, sees the initiative's potential to generate strong investment returns. \"The bottom line is this makes sense for our business,\" Ms. Cohen wrote in her note. (Goldman itself is still working on diversity. Just five of the 31 members of its management committee are women.) But to truly change things, the big investment firms \u2014 the Blackstones and KKRs and TPGs \u2014 must fundamentally change the way they hire and develop talent. Those firms have become more diverse in recent years, but there are still too few women and minorities making meaningful investment decisions. The same is true in Silicon Valley and venture capital, which is dominated by white men. That, in turn, means there are fewer women and minorities who can jump ship to start their own firms and take advantage of opportunities like the one Goldman is planning to support. That's why the idea of an inclusion rider from some of the big pension funds is such an attractive idea. Virtually every major investment firm seeks money from the big pension funds and college endowments. If those big pools of money demanded, as part of their investment, specific hiring and development requirements, the movement could create a new generation of genuinely diverse investors. The idea could take hold by way of governmental fiat \u2014 a bill introduced in California would prevent public pension funds based in that state from investing in asset managers that do not comply with race and gender pay equity policy. But wouldn't it be better if it were voluntary? There's reason to believe it could be. The New York State Common Retirement Fund recently said it would vote against boards that did not include women. And a number of large pension funds \u2014 including Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the biggest in the world; JPMorgan Asset Management; Standard Life; and BlackRock \u2014 signed a pledge in Britain to encourage that country's largest companies to increase female representation in the senior ranks to 30 percent by 2020. (The pension funds are not requiring such changes, however, and it does not include the biggest investment firms themselves.) Of course, it is possible that investment funds could refuse to take their money, pushing back on the idea that investors can steer the funds' policies. It's happened before: There are private equity funds that have threatened to not accept investments from public pensions because of certain disclosure laws required where the investor is based. That's why it would be so important for those A-list pension and endowment funds to get on board with the idea. They're the ones with the money and clout to force real change. Without a push from the very top of the investor class, it is hard to see how progress would be made. It is trite, but follow the money.

Economic gains are negating the need for crisis-era monetary policy, the Fed leader told a European Central Bank forum. \"Earlier in the expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary policy was clear,\" Powell said, according to prepared remarks. \"But with unemployment low and expected to decline further, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.\" His remarks came a week after the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise rates 0.25 percentage point. It was the sixth such increase since the Fed began normalizing policy in December 2015 after seven years of keeping its benchmark rate target anchored near zero as the economy recovered from the financial crisis. show chapters Fed's Powell: Rate 'cushion' for economy doesn't play a part in my thinking 4:32 PM ET Wed, 13 June 2018 | 02:35 At that meeting, FOMC officials indicated they were likely to approve two more rate increases, bringing the 2018 total to four. Markets, though, have remained unconvinced, with the futures market assigning just a 50.9 percent chance to a fourth hike, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Powell spoke at length about the jobs market, saying that although wage pressures remain moderate there's still good reason to believe the economy is nearing full employment. The unemployment rate is at 3.8 percent, tied for the lowest rate since 1969. \"Today, most Americans who want jobs can find them,\" he said. \"High demand for workers should support wage growth and labor force participation.\" As he has in the past, Powell stressed the need not to let accommodative policy stay in place too long. He pointed out that the last two recessions were caused by \"financial imbalances\" rather than inflation \u2014 the financial crisis of 2008 and the dot-com implosion in the early 2000s. However, he said he doesn't see anything worrisome from asset prices at present. \"While some asset prices are high by historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage. In addition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis,\" Powell said. While he said there remains uncertainty around monetary policy, the case for interest rate hikes is solid, a position he said is supported \"broadly\" by FOMC members.

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has become a hot spot for attracting the initial public offerings of some of the largest companies in the world. While U.S. markets await the IPOs of Uber and Airbnb, three Chinese companies that rank among the world's 20 largest internet firms are expected to list this year in $5 billion-plus deals in Hong Kong: Xiaomi, known as the Apple of China; Meituan-Dianping, operator of websites similar to Groupon and Yelp in China; and Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber's China business. Chinese state-owned enterprises China Tower, a mobile phone infrastructure company, and Sinopec Marketing, a spin-off of China Petroleum & Chemical's retail fuel business, are also expected to each hold $5 billion-plus listings in Hong Kong this year, according to Renaissance Capital. Hong Kong is \"perfectly positioned to provide effectively an access point\" to one of the fastest growing regions of the world, said Andy Nybo, director at Burton-Taylor International Consulting, which does financial markets research. He pointed out the former British colony has a developed economy and financial market, and provides international investors a link to mainland Chinese markets through the \"stock connect\" program. Last year, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's revenue jumped more than 18 percent, according to a Burton-Taylor report. That's greater than 6.6 percent growth in Nasdaq revenue and 2.9 percent growth for New York Stock Exchange owner ICE, the study showed. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Hong Kong's capital markets development also comes as Western institutional investors are increasingly interested in international opportunities, and Beijing looks to open up its financial markets to foreign investors. \"In general there is a huge battle for capital,\" said Sebastien Lieblich, managing director and global head of equity solutions at MSCI. \"There is clearly an incentive for the markets, the regulators, equity markets to build up their exchanges,\" he said. \"Markets [will] become more and more globalized. Emerging markets recognize they can attract that money.\" Indexing giant MSCI announced Wednesday that it would include Saudi Arabia in its benchmark emerging markets index, tracked by more than $1.9 trillion in global assets. It also reclassified Argentina to emerging market status. Last year, MSCI approved the inclusion of some of China's mainland-traded A shares. Part of those shares were officially added about three weeks ago. In greater China, new policies could also help increase capital inflows. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange implemented new rules in April allowing biotech companies without revenue or profit to apply for public listings. Beijing is also launching a \"China Depositary Receipt\" program that will allow China's tech giants, listed in Hong Kong or in the U.S., to have a dual share offering in the mainland. That said, U.S. dominance in global IPOs isn't going away. It is by far the first in terms of number of public offerings and U.S.-dollar proceeds year-to-date, according to Renaissance Capital data as of June 13. More U.S. listings are coming. Online survey company SurveyMonkey said Monday it confidentially registered for an IPO through its parent SVMK. Other public offerings expected this year include speaker systems company Sonos, personal loans firm SoFi, home improvement services platform Houzz and office space start-up WeWork, according to Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital and manager of IPO ETFs. In addition, Chinese companies still often view a New York listing as a status symbol that helps them gain brand recognition among international investors. Ten of 80 U.S. public offerings this year through June 13 were Chinese companies, Smith said. \"We have been the beneficiary of the delayed growth of these [Chinese] exchanges,\" she said. But Hong Kong is shifting away from listings of state-owned enterprise to high-growth tech companies, and mainland China's markets are slowly maturing. Down the road, Smith said, \"Hong Kong and China together could end up being the largest issuing market for IPOs.\" ", "author": "VCG | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/20/hong-kong-rising-as-hot-ipo-market.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Getty Images Xiaomi's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Lei Jun", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Mi Notebook Air", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Redmi Pro", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "The Hong Kong Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Uber", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Airbnb", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "20", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Xiaomi", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Apple of China", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Meituan-Dianping", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Didi Chuxing", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Uber", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "China Tower", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Sinopec Marketing", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China Petroleum & Chemical's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Renaissance Capital", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Andy Nybo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Burton-Taylor International Consulting", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "British", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Clearing", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 18 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Burton", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "6.6 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Nasdaq", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2.9 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "New York Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ICE", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "500px;border", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Hong Kong's", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Beijing", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Sebastien Lieblich", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "MSCI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "MSCI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Saudi Arabia", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "more than $1.9 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Argentina", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "MSCI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "about three weeks ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The Hong Kong Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Beijing", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "year-to-date", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Renaissance Capital", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "June 13", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "SurveyMonkey", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Sonos", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Houzz", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kathleen Smith", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Renaissance Capital", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Ten", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "80", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "June 13", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Smith", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Smith", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Hong Kong", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}], "description": "The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is a hot spot for attracting the initial public offerings of some of the largest companies in the world.

bid for Fox assets to $38 per share 9:08 AM ET Wed, 20 June 2018 | 05:32 Walt Disney Co. raised its bid for Twenty-First Century Fox's movie and television assets to $71.3 billion, the companies announced Wednesday. The new bid is $38 a share, up from Disney's $28 a share offer in December and rivaling Comcast's $35 a share all-cash bid last week. Comcast's deal is valued at $65 billion. The bidding war was expected as the two media giants battle over Fox's movie production business as well as networks National Geographic and FX, Star TV, stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group, Hulu and regional sports networks. Disney's new bid allows Fox shareholders to choose cash or stock. Fox called the new Disney offer \"superior\" to the Comcast proposal. Fox's Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Disney CEO Robert Iger met Tuesday night before this new bid was submitted, sources told CNBC's David Faber. Fox shares were up 7.3 percent Wednesday, while shares of Disney rose around 1 percent. Iger said on a conference call that Disney does not expect to complete the $20 billion share buyback it announced in December. Shares of CNBC parent Comcast jumped 1.8 percent Wednesday, moving after Bloomberg News reported that the Justice Department was set to approve Disney's bid in as soon as two weeks. The company has agreed to sell some assets to gain approval, a source told Bloomberg. The Justice Department, Fox and Disney did not respond immediately to requests for comment from CNBC. Comcast declined to comment. In a statement on Wednesday, Murdoch said, \"We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox, and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry.\" The statement added, \"We remain convinced that the combination of [Fox's] iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney's will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.\" Iger said in a statement Wednesday that the combination with the Fox units would allow Disney to create more appealing content, expand its direct-to-consumer offerings and international presence and \"deliver more personalized and compelling entertainment experiences to meet growing consumer demand around the world.\" Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Co. Disney's bid in December was a stock deal worth $52.4 billion at the time, but CNBC has reported that the company was willing to add cash to sweeten the offer if a rival stepped in. Disney said Wednesday, \"Since the original agreement was announced, the intrinsic value of these assets has increased, notably due to tax reform and operating improvements.\" Fox's board had a scheduled meeting on Wednesday at which it was expected to talk about Comcast's rival bid. Fox said its board hadn't concluded Comcast's unsolicited bid \"could reasonably be expected to result in a 'Company Superior Proposal' under the Disney Merger Agreement.\" A spokesman for Comcast said the company does not have a comment right now. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. Read the full press releases here: 21st Century Fox Board Announces Amended and Restated Merger Agreement With Disney NEW YORK, June 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (\"21CF\") (NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX) announced today that it has entered into an amended and restated merger agreement with The Walt Disney Company (\"Disney\") (NYSE: DIS) pursuant to which Disney has agreed to acquire for a price of $38 per 21CF share the same businesses Disney agreed to acquire under the previously announced merger agreement between 21CF and Disney (the \"Disney Merger Agreement\"). This price represents a significant increase over the purchase price of approximately $28 per share included in the Disney Merger Agreement when it was announced in December 2017. The amended and restated Disney Merger Agreement offers a package of consideration, flexibility and deal certainty enhancements that is superior to the proposal made by the Comcast Corporation on June 13, 2018. Under the amended and restated Disney Merger Agreement, Disney would acquire those businesses on substantially the same terms, except that, among other things, Disney's offer allows 21CF stockholders to elect to receive their consideration, on a value equalized basis, in the form of cash or stock, subject to 50/50 proration. The collar on the stock consideration will ensure that 21st Century Fox shareholders will receive a number of Disney shares equal to $38 in value if the average Disney stock price at closing is between $93.53 and $114.32. \"We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox, and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry,\" said Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox. \"We remain convinced that the combination of 21CF's iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney's will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.\" In light of the revised terms contained in the amended and restated Disney Merger Agreement, 21CF's board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, has not concluded that the unsolicited proposal it received on June 13, 2018 from Comcast could reasonably be expected to result in a \"Company Superior Proposal\" under the Disney Merger Agreement. However, the amended and restated Disney Merger Agreement contains no changes to the provisions relating to the Company's directors' ability to evaluate a competing proposal. As announced on May 30, 2018, 21CF has established a record date of May 29, 2018 and a meeting date of July 10, 2018, for a special meeting of its stockholders to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Disney Merger Agreement. 21CF has determined to postpone its special meeting of stockholders to a future date in order to provide stockholders the opportunity to evaluate the terms of Disney's revised proposal and other developments to date. Once 21CF determines the new date for 21CF's special meeting of stockholders, the date will be communicated to 21CF stockholders. The Walt Disney Company Signs Amended Acquisition Agreement To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., For $71.3 Billion In Cash And Stock New $38-per-share acquisition gives 21st Century Fox shareholders option to electcash or stock in the combined entity BURBANK, Calif., June 20, 2018\u2014The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) todayannounced that it has signed an amended acquisition agreement with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (\"21st Century Fox\" \u2014NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX), for $38 per share in cash and stock. Disney will acquire 21st Century Fox immediately following the spin-off of the businesses comprising \"New Fox\" as previously announced. Under the amended agreement, 21st Century Fox shareholders may elect to receive, for each share of 21st Century Fox common stock, $38 in either cash or shares of Disney common stock (subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities as described in the original acquisition announcement). The overall mix of consideration paid to 21st Century Fox shareholders will be approximately 50% cash and 50% stock. The stock consideration is subject to a collar (described below under 'Transaction Details') and is expected to be tax-free to 21st Century Fox shareholders. The 21st Century Fox businesses to be acquired by Disney remain the same as under the original agreement. Since the original agreement was announced, the intrinsic value ofthese assets has increased, notably due to tax reform and operating improvements. \"The acquisition of 21st Century Fox will bring significant financial value to the shareholders of both companies, and after six months of integration planning we're even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,\" said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. \"At a time of dynamic change in the entertainment industry, the combination of Disney's and Fox's unparalleled collection of businesses and franchises will allow us to create more appealing high-quality content, expand our direct-to consumer offerings and international presence, and deliver more personalized and compelling entertainment experiences to meet growing consumer demand around the world.\" Disney is expected to pay a total of approximately $35.7 billion in cash and issue approximately 343 million new shares to 21st Century Fox shareholders, representing about a 19% stake in Disney on a pro forma basis. The collar on the stock consideration will ensure that 21st Century Fox shareholders will receive a number of Disney shares equal to $38 in value if the average Disney stock price at closing is between $93.53 and $114.32. 21st Century Fox shareholders will receive an exchange ratio of 0.3324 shares of Disney common stock if the average Disney stock price at closing is above $114.32 and 0.4063 shares of Disney common stock if the average Disney stock price at closing is below $93.53. Elections of cash and stock will be subject to proration to the extent cash or stock is oversubscribed. Disney will also assume about $13.8 billion of net debt of 21st Century Fox. The acquisition price implies a total equity value of approximately $71.3 billion and a total transaction value of approximately $85.1 billion (assuming no tax adjustment). Disney has secured financing commitments for the cash portion of the acquisition. The amended transaction is expected to be accretive to Disney earnings per share before the impact of purchase accounting for the second fiscal year after the close of the transaction, and to yield at least $2 billion in cost synergies by 2021 from operating efficiencies realized through the combination of businesses. As announced in the original acquisition agreement, the businesses to be acquired byDisney include 21st Century Fox's film production businesses, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures and Fox 2000 Pictures; Fox's television creative units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox 21; FX Networks; National Geographic Partners; Fox Sports Regional Networks; Fox Networks Group International; Star India; and Fox's interests in Hulu, Sky plc, and Tata Sky. The acquisition will occur immediately after the spin-off by 21st Century Fox of the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company referred to as New Fox. If 21st Century Fox completes its acquisition of the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own prior to closing of the Disney acquisition, Disney would assume full ownership of Sky, including the assumption of its outstanding debt, upon closing. The acquisition will significantly increase Disney's international footprint and expand the content and distribution for its direct-to-consumer (DTC) offerings, which include ESPN+ for sports fans; a Disney-branded streaming video-on-demand service launching in late 2019 that will feature Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars films along with a host of exclusive original content and library titles; and its ownership stake in Hulu. As a result of the acquisition, Disney will hold a controlling stake in Hulu. Disney believes the transaction has a clear and timely path to regulatory approval. Both companies have spent the past six months working toward meeting all conditions necessary for closing. In the amended agreement, Disney has increased the scope of its commitment to take actions required to secure regulatory approval. The amended agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of Disney and 21st Century Fox. The transaction is subject to approval by Disney and 21st Century Fox shareholders, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, a number of other non-United States merger and other regulatory reviews, and other customary closing conditions. Both companies had been scheduled to hold shareholder meetings on the previously announced transaction on July 10. In light of the amended agreement, the companies are required to prepare updated SEC filings and proxy materials which will be sent to shareholders. A new date for the shareholder meetings will be announced. Disney will conduct an investor conference call at approximately 8:30 a.m. EDT / 5:30a.m. PDT today, June 20, 2018.

A $2 billion fraud at India's Punjab National Bank (PNB) may have been orchestrated by a few rogue employees, but it escaped detection because of widespread risk-control and monitoring lapses in many areas of the bank, the bank's own internal probe has found. PNB, India's second-biggest state-controlled lender, has previously alleged that a handful of staff at a single Mumbai branch issued fake bank guarantees over several years to help two jewellery groups - controlled by Indian diamond magnate Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi - raise billions of dollars in foreign credit and commit India's biggest-ever bank fraud. The bank's CEO Sunil Mehta told Reuters in April he had suspended 21 officials and \"will not spare\" others found involved in lapses, but he also described the fraud as a \"small turmoil\". However, a 162-page internal report, produced by PNB officials tasked with probing the fraud, lays bare lapses that go far beyond a few branch officers. The report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, lays out how failings by 54 PNB officials - ranging from clerks to foreign exchange managers, and auditors to heads of regional offices, allowed the fraud to be perpetrated. Eight of the 54 are among those who have been charged by the federal police for their roles in the scandal. The report, which the PNB officials presented to the bank's fraud risk management arm on April 5, along with dozens of pages of annexed bank records and internal e-mails, is also part of the evidence submitted by the federal police in its court case against those allegedly involved in the fraud. The report's findings have not previously been made public. Damning conclusions The unearthing of the fraud in January has not only exposed shortcomings in the management of PNB, but has also undermined confidence in India's state-run banking sector, which controls over two-thirds of the nation's bank assets. The damning conclusions of the report stand in contrast to the lack of regulatory action taken by the authorities since the fraud was reported. No penalty has been imposed on PNB as a result of the fraud and there has been no senior management shake-up. A PNB spokesman told Reuters the bank \"cannot share details on a sub-judice case\". He added: \"We must reiterate that we will not spare anybody who is found guilty irrespective of the level or position in the bank,\" he said. PNB did not respond to a question about what action was taken against the \"erring\" officials mentioned in the report. The Reserve Bank of India, the nation's central bank, and the Indian government's federal banking secretary, Rajiv Kumar, didn't respond to requests for comment. The report does not say whether the PNB investigators believe those involved in the monitoring failures were aware of the fraud. Significantly, they said one of the reasons the fraud went undetected for years was because of lapses within some of the bank's critical areas at its New Delhi headquarters, such as its credit review and international banking units. \"There was enough evidence to suggest failures,\" the team of four senior PNB investigators said in its report. \"It was observed that blatant system violations/unethical practices/dereliction of responsibilities led bank to such a catastrophe.\" Fraud at Brady House The epicenter of the fraud was PNB's Brady House branch, housed in a building with an imposing colonial facade in downtown Mumbai. From there, deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty for years issued fraudulent credit guarantees over the SWIFT interbank messaging network, the bank and prosecutors have alleged. Using those guarantees, companies controlled by Nirav Modi, whose jewelry creations were once adorned by global celebrities, and Choksi, received credit from banks overseas to fraudulently fund their businesses, PNB alleges. Modi and Choksi, both of whom left India before PNB filed its first police complaint on Jan 29, have denied any wrongdoing. Shetty's lawyer has said his client is not guilty. All face charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, as well as allegations under India's prevention of corruption law. A police source told Reuters on Monday the federal investigating agency last week asked the international police agency Interpol to help locate Modi and Choksi. Calls and text messages to lawyers for Modi and Choksi went unanswered. Lack of integration Shetty escaped detection because he did not log his SWIFT transactions on the bank's internal software \u2014 something he was supposed to do because the two systems were not integrated. PNB investigators said the bank's international banking department and the IT division had delayed the integration work. They had also not complied with central bank advisories in 2016 calling for a comprehensive audit of SWIFT systems in use. But more simply, the fraud could have been detected if the branch did the basic daily SWIFT reconciliation that, according to internal rules, required logs of transactions on the global payments network to be manually checked against the bank's internal system, the investigators said. \"Only one activity would have nailed the whole act at the incipient stage,\" said the report. The lapses, however, extended beyond the branch. As per protocol, the daily reconciliation reports should travel up the chain to PNB's headquarters in New Delhi. Along the way, they would be signed off by the Brady House branch head and sent each month to a Mumbai city regional office that would issue all-clear certificates for the branches it controls. But despite receiving just two of the 12 monthly reports from the Brady House branch last year, the regional office signed off on a \"false\" compliance certificate, signalling a clean bill of health for the branch, the report said. Moreover, despite a massive missing paper trail, none of the senior inspection officers, who conducted 10 visits between 2010 and 2017 to the branch, reported anything \"adverse,\" PNB's report stated. Missed major red flag The Mumbai city regional office also missed another vital red flag \u2014 the Brady House branch was a star performer, largely because of its dealings with Modi firms, the PNB report said. Its import and export transactions in the 12 months to March 2017 stood at $3.3 billion, 50 percent higher than recorded two years prior. \"The exceptional growth should have been noticed,\" the report said. A former PNB internal audit official who declined to be identified but reviewed the growth numbers mentioned in the report for Reuters, said: \"This was sufficient to raise a cause of concern and the reasons thereof should have been investigated.\" Signs that audit practices at Brady House were weak were also flagged by the branch itself, according to two internal PNB documents reviewed by Reuters. In March 2012, the branch said in an internal memo that an almost 50 percent of the observations flagged in its annual inspection report - mainly auditor queries \u2014 remained \"un replied/unattended to by respective concerned officers,\" calling it a \"critical situation.\" Four years later, in 2016, the branch's assistant general manager issued an internal memo saying around 18 observations \u2014 five described as zero-tolerance level issues \u2014 were pending. The memo was signed by 10 bank officers, including Shetty. Late-night emails Shetty joined the forex division at Brady House in April 2010. In March 2011, the branch issued the first fake credit guarantees of $15.5 million to Modi's firms through SWIFT messages, bypassing the internal banking system, the PNB investigators said. Over the coming years, Shetty authorized more than 1200 fraudulent credit guarantees, the report said. As a mid-level employee, Shetty should only have been able to approve transactions of up to 2.5 million rupees ($37,000) without sign-off from more senior officials. But he had been given unlimited approval powers, the investigators said without explaining how this happened. In the few weeks before his retirement in May last year, Shetty used his personal Yahoo e-mail address to send 22 e-mails \u2014 18 at around midnight \u2014 to reconcile large forex transactions involving the Modi group. The use of personal e-mail was \"overlooked\" by the bank's treasury department, the report said. Under PNB policy, no officer should remain in the same office for more than three years, but Shetty retired after serving in Brady House for seven years. Three transfer orders were issued for him during his tenure, but he was never moved, the investigators found. The report said that it is \"incomprehensible\" that branch staff did not notice the fraud being committed.

Now he's staring at a bid that's almost $20 billion higher. On Wednesday, Disney increased its cash and stock proposal to $71.3 billion. That's because Judge Richard Leon's decision last week to allow AT&T to buy Time Warner without conditions encouraged Comcast to offer $65 billion for the Fox assets (a move it considered for months), topping Disney's bid. And it led Disney to hit right back. Many media companies were rooting for the Time Warner deal to be approved because removing the regulatory concerns around big deals unlocks potential buyers. Verizon, Charter, Comcast and AT&T now have the flexibility to buy content companies without nearly as much fear that their deals will be blocked. Shares of Discovery, Lionsgate, AMC, CBS and Viacom are all up since Leon's ruling as investors circle potential targets, knowing that whoever is the losing bidder for Fox's assets could conceivably look to acquire a different content company. But don't expect Comcast to just walk away from Disney's latest offer. Comcast is fully prepared for a bidding war and expected Disney to increase its bid, even if the amount of cash Disney added to the offer (50 percent) may have come as a bit of a surprise. Comcast is now deliberating its next move. This could go on for a while, and it's all good news for Fox shareholders as well as other investors in the space hungry for returns.

Its creation was included eight years ago in the Dodd\u2013Frank financial reforms and the CFPB officially came into being in 2011. The CFPB focuses on consumer protection in the financial sector, and oversees banks, credit unions and other U.S. firms. During his tenure as acting director, Mulvaney oversaw a $1 billion fine on Wells Fargo for violating consumer financial protection laws. But he has also tried to curtail the agency. \"The bureau has never been through a transition, we're going to learn how to do that,\" Mulvaney said, referring to changes after Donald Trump's election as president. \"The bureau is different, we are associated with our founding, the principles of someone who founded us.\" Mulvaney, who also runs the White House budget office, was tapped by President Trump in November to temporarily run the bureau after the departure of its original director, Richard Cordray. The CFPB became a topic in the heated debate on President Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy this week. On Tuesday, Sen. Warren said she would block President Trump's nominee for an official replacement for Cordray, Kathy Kraninger, until she turns over documents concerning any role she might have played in separating children from their parents at the Southern U.S. border. Kraninger is an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"I will put a hold on her nomination \u2014 & fight it at every step \u2014 until she turns over all documents,\" Sen. Warren said in the tweet. TWEET After bipartisan calls from Senator Warren and Republicans to at least temporarily end the family separation policy, on Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order that he says will keep families together if they are detained on the U.S.-Mexico border. For days the White House insisted an end to the splitting of migrant families on the border could only happen through congressional action. Despite Senator Warren's threats, Mulvaney said he expects Kraninger to be confirmed by the end of the fourth quarter.

Bitcoin fell from about $6,718.35 to as low as $6,561.79, following the tweets from Bithumb, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index. The price then started recovering and at 10:03 a.m. HK/SIN, bitcoin traded at $6,614.46. Such a move is relatively staid for the regularly volatile asset. CoinDesk data also showed that the price of ethereum fell from levels near $535 to as low as $521.07 before recovering slightly. South Korea is a major cryptocurrency trading center and Bithumb is one of the busiest virtual coin exchanges. Earlier this month, a relatively small South Korean exchange, Coinrail, tweeted that it had been hacked, and noted that lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as Pundi X were among those affected. Some observers suggested that news affected bitcoin and sent the price on the Coindesk index to its lowest in two months. Still, given the relative size of Coinrail, that claim proved inconclusive. That said, the decline also coincided with a broader crypto sell-off that followed a Wall Street Journal report that said U.S. regulators were investigating potential price manipulation at four major cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoi, and ethereum then received a boost after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official said that neither of those crypto assets are securities. At the same time, the SEC also said that many, but not all, initial coin offerings could be securities and would come under the regulatory control of the SEC and relevant securities laws. \u2014 CNBC's Evelyn Cheng and Reuters contributed to this report.

For the past six months, J.P. Morgan Chase has quietly been shuttling clients to the bank's technology lab on the West Side of Manhattan for a glimpse at the future of work. The executives \u2014 treasurers and finance chiefs of some of the world's biggest companies \u2014 were introduced to an artificial intelligence-powered servant that J.P. Morgan hopes will soon be able to answer queries and anticipate their needs, a first in the world of corporate payments. But before that could happen, the machine needed contact with people to figure out what makes humans tick. The bank is widening the trials with select clients next week and plans to release it to more companies next year. \"I am continuously learning and improving,\" the program says shortly after introducing itself in a chatbox. \"Watch out for new features.\" show chapters How AI and humans can work together in financial trading: Exec 9:04 PM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 02:47 J.P. Morgan's latest attempt at furthering automation in finance is happening in its treasury services division, a key business that helps corporate clients from Honeywell International to Facebook move money around the world. Unseen by retail consumers, the unit handles an average of $5 trillion daily, from the mundane (payroll and supplier remittances) to the unusual (multibillion-dollar checks for huge mergers). The area, once considered boring, has gotten more attention lately. Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners built a $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup this year partly on the strength of the bank's treasury services unit and other steady, hard-to-dislodge services where technology is lowering costs. The industry's revenue is expected to grow 7 percent a year through 2025, according to J.P. Morgan. AI goes corporate Big lenders, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, have already rolled out virtual assistants to millions of retail customers, but the technology is just making its way to corporate clients, who present bigger challenges for artificial intelligence programmers. For instance, while a checking customer typically has a handful of accounts, a company could have 10,000 accounts in dozens of currencies around the world, and each individual corporate user typically has permission to see only certain accounts. It's the latest example of technology that was pioneered for retail use spreading to institutional clients. Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan rolled out Amazon's voice-activated assistant Alexa for investment banking clients to help them access research. Not long after the bank created mobile apps for its trading business, clients were using them to execute large trades, including a $400 million currency wager last year. The bank, which is hoping to unseat Citigroup as the leader in wholesale payments, started its virtual assistant project late last year after clients asked for an easier way to navigate the firm's online portal, according to Jason Tiede, innovation head for treasury services. The bank hired a New York-based startup called Kasisto to run the program's AI engine. show chapters Bank of America COO on the Real Role of AI 4:55 PM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 | 03:57 Today, users have to navigate through some of the website's 1,200 pages to do such things as send wires or export data from multiple accounts to determine balances, he said. Soon, clients can simply ask the assistant for information on balances. The AI program \u2014 which has yet to be given a name \u2014 learns from its users, seeing what questions they typically ask and patterns their actions, Tiede said. It will eventually be able to make recommendations: for example, call these 5 customers first because they are late on payments. The plan is for it to spread beyond desktop computers to mobile and voice-activated devices, he said. Pilot program launches next week J.P. Morgan wouldn't disclose what it spent on this project but has said that 40 percent of its $10.8 billion annual technology budget is devoted to new efforts, including AI, robotic process automation and blockchain. \"Based on your behavior each time, it will start to learn what you ask for,\" Tiede said in an interview. \"We think there's a huge opportunity to suggest creative and insightful recommendations to clients. When you log in, it can say, 'Looks like you have sent 100 US dollar wires to Singapore. Do you know you could send a foreign-exchange ACH payment instead? Click here to sign up.'\" Treasury services made about $7.6 billion in revenue last year, mostly on fees, currency exchange and lending out some of the division's roughly $350 billion in deposits. But a big growth area is in providing analysis from the data the bank sees, and this virtual assistant is one way to deliver that, Tiede said. Before that happens, though, the program needs to mature further. J.P. Morgan is starting a pilot next week with a few dozen users from technology, e-commerce and manufacturing firms. The bank is also adding human employees as a backup in case the program is flummoxed. \"We're saying to these pilot clients: You need to use this every day,\" Tiede said. \"Even if it's not able to solve your needs, seeing what you write helps it to learn.\" Correction: This story has been revised to clarify that J.P. Morgan's treasury services, including both the corporate investment and commercial banks, made about $7.6 billion in revenue last year.

It is the latest evidence of a stronger economy pulling people back into the job market or preventing workers from being sidelined in the first place. The drop is so significant that the agency has revised its estimates of how long the program will continue to be financially secure. This month, the government announced that the program would not run out of money until 2032, four years later than its previous estimate last year. Two years ago, the government had warned that the funds might be depleted by 2023. In addition to stronger economic growth, the drop reflects newly tightened standards for eligibility and the increasing number of baby boomers who are leaving the program because they have become eligible for Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare. Read more from The New York Times: Will employment keep growing? Disabled workers offer a clue The disability trap Congress is writing lots of opioid bills. But which ones will actually help? Fewer than 1.5 million Americans applied to the Social Security Administration for disability coverage last year, the lowest since 2002. Applications are running at an even lower rate this year, government officials say. All told, 8.63 million workers received disability benefits in May, down from a peak of 8.96 million in September 2014. A drop of several hundred thousand may not sound like much. But it is a sharp turnaround from what seemed to be an inexorable rise, in which the disability rolls more than doubled over the past 25 years. That increase led some conservative lawmakers to criticize the program as wasteful and riddled with fraud. The Social Security Administration expected the number of applicants to decline after the recession when the total number of beneficiaries topped out, but even government number crunchers were caught off guard by the steepness and duration of the fall. \"It has just kept dropping, by a much greater extent than we anticipated,\" said Stephen C. Goss, the agency's chief actuary. \"We're still not done \u2014 we should have a little bit more good news in 2018.\" When the economy is strong and growing, there tends to be more lower-skilled jobs available that do not require manual labor \u2014 the kind of work that many people with modest disabilities are best suited for. \"When the economy gets better, employers are more willing to look to other labor pools and be more accommodating,\" said Eric Kingson, a professor of social work at Syracuse University. \"Some people with disabilities also have a sense there may be something out there that fits with their needs.\" Of course, other factors have contributed to the decline in disability applications. As aging baby boomers receive Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare, fewer require disability benefits. People in the disability program receive an average of $1,200 a month and get health insurance through Medicare. What's more, with the expansion of Medicaid in 33 states and the District of Columbia as well as improved access to insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, many experts argue, fewer people see the disability program as a way to obtain health care. Finally, the Social Security Administration has been making it harder to qualify for benefits, according to scholars and advocates. In some cases, just applying has become more arduous, said T.J. Sutcliffe, senior director of income and housing policy at the Arc, an advocacy group for people with disabilities. Budget cuts have taken a toll, she said, with 67 Social Security field offices closing since 2010. A 2017 study by Manasi Deshpande of the University of Chicago and Yue Li of the State University of New York at Albany found that \"field office closings lead to large and persistent reductions in the number of disability recipients.\" Applicants with \"moderately severe conditions, low education levels and low pre-application earnings\" were hardest hit. Applicants also face an increasingly uphill battle appealing rejections, with the administrative law judges who handle these cases taking a much more skeptical stance. \"If you make it harder, people just run out of gas,\" said Richard Browdie, chief executive of the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging in Cleveland. \"There are a whole bunch of new impediments, and I think the process has become overly restrictive.\" The internal changes were spurred by a deluge of criticism in the media and in Congress. Expos\u00e9s on \"60 Minutes\" in 2013 and in The Wall Street Journal in 2011 depicted widespread abuse and fraud as millions signed up for benefits. \"Some in Congress refuse to acknowledge that the disability programs are broken and in dire need of significant oversight,\" Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who led an investigation into the program, warned in 2013. \"People who are truly disabled will pay the price of our dithering.\" In response, the Social Security Administration analyzed why some of its judges were approving a much larger proportion of appeals than others, said Nicole Maestas, a Harvard economist. Judges were retrained, and those who approved appeals at higher rates were singled out for special instruction, she said. Over all, the odds of a successful appeal fell to 48 percent in 2015, from 69 percent in 2008. The move to tighten standards for disability claims was quickly felt. For example, Binder & Binder, a law firm based in Hauppauge, N.Y., that had once flooded the airwaves with ads offering help in filing disability claims for years, declared bankruptcy in 2014 and laid off most of its staff in 2017. The Social Security Administration tightened the approval process \"behind the scenes\" without a big announcement, said Mark Duggan, director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \"In part, it was a response to the media spotlight and subsequent investigations,\" he said. Whatever the cause \u2014 demographic, economic or driven by policy \u2014 the postrecession narrative of an out-of-control entitlement program has been upended, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist of Deutsche Bank. \"This is a big deal,\" Mr. Slok said. \"We thought the numbers for disability would go up forever.\" Mr. Slok said he saw a deeper significance in the falling number of claims \u2014 he said it suggested there may be more workers on the sidelines than many experts estimate. If he is right, the Federal Reserve might not need to rush to raise interest rates, despite the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in May, an 18-year low. Still, as the labor market tightens, not only are less-physically demanding jobs more widely available, but employers are more willing to consider workers they might have overlooked in the past. During boom and bust alike, Christian Borrero always wanted to work full time. Born with cerebral palsy, Mr. Borrero, 31, had been receiving Social Security checks in one form or another for nearly his entire life. A program sponsored by a nonprofit organization enabled him to work at a bank answering phones, but the salary in that part-time job was low enough that Mr. Borrero still qualified for disability payments. In 2015, a landscape supplies and waste-to-energy company offered him a full-time job as a receptionist. Mr. Borrero turned it down \u2014 twice. \"I knew deep down if I took it, I would lose my benefits,\" he recalled. \"I was terrified.\" Friends persuaded him to reconsider. So when the firm, Kurtz Bros. in Independence, Ohio, made him a third offer, he took a few days to consider it and eventually said yes. \"I was still terrified of going off disability, but I'd never had a job with real benefits and real hours,\" he said. After he was on the job for several months in 2016, what Mr. Borrero had feared came to pass \u2014 the Social Security Administration informed him that his disability benefits would soon stop because he had a full-time job. Mr. Borrero was so determined to keep working, he resigned himself to finding a second job to replace the $895 a month in disability benefits he would no longer receive. But when Kurtz Bros. got wind of his plan, it gave him additional responsibilities and a raise that made up for the lost money. \"Unemployment is down, and it can be incredibly difficult to find good people,\" said Jackie Repicky, human resources director for Kurtz Bros. \"So when we find people who work hard and have a great attitude, we try to keep and promote them.\" For Mr. Borrero, the experience has been life-changing. \"It's very, very rewarding,\" he said. \"They treat me like a regular employee. They never baby me.\" At the bank, he said, \"I was never going to move anywhere. They were supportive, but I wanted to move from a supportive environment to a competitive one.\" \"I haven't had an easy life,\" he said. \"But I love the feeling of earning enough money to pay my bills and do what I want to do. I feel very blessed.\" Other disabled workers may not be so fortunate to find a position that enables them to forgo disability benefits, he added, \"but my example shows they can try.\" ", "author": "Andrew Spear | The New York Times", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/20/disability-applications-plunge-as-the-economy-strengthens.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Andrew Spear", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "The New York Times Christian Borrero", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Independence", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Ohio", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "June 14, 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Americans", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Social Security", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "decades-old", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "This month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2032", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "four years later", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Two years ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2023", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Social Security", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Medicare", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The New York Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Congress", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fewer than 1.5 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Americans", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "the Social Security Administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2002", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "8.63 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "8.96 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "September 2014", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "several hundred thousand", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the past 25 years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "The Social Security Administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the fall", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Stephen C.

Federated Investors' Phil Orlando is out with a note suggesting a cruel summer for stocks has arrived. \"We're expecting an air pocket here that will take the market down to let's say the 200-day moving average over the summer months,\" the firm's chief equity strategist said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" His latest thoughts came shortly after stocks tumbled and went negative for the year. Right now, the Dow is on a six-day losing streak, and the S&P 500 just saw its fourth negative session in five. \"You've got the North Korea situation. You've got what happened with the Federal Reserve and the ECB last week. You've got a number of headwinds here. So, why wouldn't investors take some profits?\" asked Orlando. But he doesn't think the air pocket will morph into a black hole for stocks. Orlando has a 3,100 year-end target on the S&P 500, about a 12 percent jump from current levels. \"We thought a 5 percent air pocket, give or take, over the next month or so made perfect sense,\" Orlando said. \"Once we get all of the concerns about the midterm elections, the Federal Reserve, etc., behind us post-Labor Day, we're looking for a very solid, very strong fourth quarter rally into year-end.\" And, he has a playbook to take advantage of a pullback ahead of that upward move. It starts with a group that has been ripping to new highs: small-cap stocks. \"We think this rally that we're seeing in the Russell has legs,\" he said. \"We've had a big call on small cap, and we continue to like that particularly in this environment where you have all this trade-related concern. Small cap companies typically do 80 percent or so of their business here. So, they're not as harmed.\" He also wouldn't ignore large-cap value stocks such as financials, energy and industrials \u2014 groups he believes will perform well in a rising interest rate environment.

Deutsche Bank upgraded Citigroup shares to buy from hold, noting the stock could get a boost from beaten-down levels given upcoming stress test results and a better business environment. Citi shares are down 17 percent from their 52-week high hit in late January, underperforming Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase by 9 percent over this period, research analyst Matt O'Connor and his team said in a Tuesday report. Several events ahead could help Citi, the analysts said. First, results from annual Federal Reserve stress tests that are due June 21 and 28 \"should be positive\" for Citi. Second, macroeconomic negatives such as rising U.S. rates and a stronger U.S. dollar may abate. Third, there have been some \"positive\" developments in Citi's U.S. credit card business around partnerships with Sears and Costco. In addition, \"expectations on cost efforts have been lowered enough that we don't see further disappointment.\" Citi is scheduled to release second quarter results before the open on July 13. The analysts also noted a \"very positive\" backdrop for Citi in fixed income trading, a category in which the company ranks second. The bank has also been \"gaining momentum\" in equities trading, the report said. Citi also has \"one of the biggest capital return stories among big banks,\" since management's plan to return at least $20 billion in capital a year in the near future represents 12 percent of the bank's market cap, the analysts said. \"Given the recent sell off in C shares and low valuation, the buybacks should matter more than they did,\" they said. Shares of Citi rose 1.5 percent in premarket trading Wednesday. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo remain the Deutsche Bank analysts' top picks. For Goldman, they expect investment banking fees to rise roughly 10 percent year-on-year, and trading to increase about 20 percent \"with strength in FICC.\" Wells Fargo's financial situation makes the bank \"well positioned\" for the upcoming \"CCAR\" stress test, the report said.

Chinese acquisitions and investments in the U.S. fell 92 percent to just $1.8 billion in the first five months of this year, consulting and research firm Rhodium Group said Tuesday. Counting divestitures, net Chinese deal flow to the U.S. during that time was a negative $7.8 billion, the report said. The decline follows a sharp drop in the second half of last year as pressure from both Beijing and the Trump administration curbed a recent surge in cross-border investment. Completed Chinese deals in the U.S. hit a record $46 billion in 2016, and dropped to $29 billion in 2017, according to Rhodium. Completed Chinese FDI deals in the US* in $ millions (2006-2018) Source: Rhodium Group. *Includes completed M&A transactions with over 10% resulting stake and greenfield projects that have broken ground. **January to May 2018. In a search for investment opportunities, Chinese companies went on an overseas buying spree in 2015 and 2016. But now, China wants to limit capital flight and excessive leverage. The U.S. is worried about intellectual property protection and has increased scrutiny of deals on the basis of national security. The Trump administration has also threatened restrictions on investment based on a \"Section 301\" investigation, the same study that led to the latest tariff announcements. As a result, acquisitions worth more than $2 billion in the first five months of this year have fallen apart, Rhodium Group's Thilo Hanemann said. They include Alibaba-affiliate Ant Financial's proposed merger with MoneyGram, HNA's plans to acquire Anthony Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital and China-backed fund Sino IC Capital's efforts to buy semiconductor testing company Xcerra. \"The pipeline of pending M&A transactions remains thinner and the average transaction value far lower than in previous periods,\" Hanemann said in the report. He pointed out that in contrast to the typical hundreds of millions of dollars or more, the average size of Chinese deals in the U.S. so far this year was $46 million. Big Chinese conglomerates HNA, Anbang and Wanda, are also selling many of their U.S. assets, sending the amount of completed U.S. divestitures to $9.6 billion in the first five months of this year, according to Rhodium. The analysis estimates another $4 billion in sales is pending. The sales come amid pressure from Beijing for Chinese companies to expand overseas \u2014 in matching industries. A criticism of the conglomerates' many entertainment and real estate deals was their fit with business strategy. Real estate and entertainment remained among the top three recipients of Chinese capital this year, driven by midsize deals and overseas-listed internet and gaming companies, Rhodium said. But thanks to seven transactions in health and biotech, the industry's share of overall Chinese deals in the U.S. rose from 9 percent last year to 58 percent so far this year, the report said.

Endemol Shine Group, the Netherlands-based TV producer of shows including \"Black Mirror\" and \"MasterChef\" has hired Deutsche Bank and Liontree to seek a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. Endemol is co-owned by 21st Century Fox and Apollo Global Management, each of which owns 50 percent of the company. Finding a buyer for the entire entity could simplify ownership and marry Endemol's content portfolio, which also includes \"Big Brother\" and \"Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown,\" with a larger library. Both Fox and Apollo have agreed to sell their takes if a buyer is found. Fox has already passed up the right to buy all of Endemol, and in fact agreed to sell its 50 percent stake to Disney in December as part of its $52 billion (at the time) sale. Fox is supportive of the business but chose not to acquire it given its deal with Disney, one of the people said. A sale could value Endemol between $2.5 billion and $4 billion, including debt, two of the people said. Deadline reported in April that U.K. media company ITV would consider buying Endemol should a formal process start, which has now happened, said the people. If a sale is completed, Disney or Comcast -- whichever company ends up buying the Fox assets -- would likely be awarded the cash from the sale, the people said. Elizabeth Murdoch, daughter of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, founded Shine and sold it to News Corp in 2011. In 2014, Endemol agreed to merge with Shine Group and Core Media Group with Apollo taking half of the combined company. Spokespeople for Fox, Liontree, Apollo and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. A spokesperson for Endemol couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

For a president who has otherwise been extremely friendly to business and stocks, new research by CNBC shows Mr. Trump's trade policies have cost markets trillions of dollars and created head-spinning volatility. There have been 35 moves of 1 percent or more in the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year. CNBC found fully a third of these moves, or 12 days, were substantially linked to news about trade. On seven of the 12 days, negative trade developments sent the Dow lower by an average of 1.7 percent and cost investors a cumulative $700 billion in market capitalization. On the same days that the Dow dropped 1 percent on trade news, the S&P 500 fell a cumulative $2.2 trillion. But with five of those 12 days, on news that trade tensions were easing, stocks bounced back, restoring $560 billion in value for the Dow and $1.7 trillion of S&P market cap. How does it all total out? Looking at just these days of 1 percent moves or more, CNBC found the trade news is negative on net for stocks, suggesting trade is one big reason stocks are flat this year even amid strong GDP and job growth and the president's profit- and business-friendly corporate tax cuts. \"Markets are going to have to count a couple of steps ahead when it comes to trade disputes with the EU and trade disputes with China,'' said Michael Zezas, head of public policy at Morgan Stanley, in a CNBC interview today. \"And when you start adding up those effects, while they might be small and individual based, they very quickly offset the fiscal stimulus you got from tax cuts and spending increases.\" The research shows the companies taking the biggest hits from negative trade news are household-name stocks deeply involved in world trade: Caterpillar, Boeing, 3M and DowDupont. But even big financials like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are hurt from when news of new tariffs come over the tape. Among the biggest daily drops, on March 22, Trump announced $60 billion in tariffs on China. Markets plunged 2.9 percent, wiping out $165 billion of market cap. Four days later, the Dow surged 2.8 percent after a Wall Street Journal story said that the U.S. and China were quietly negotiating to improve trade. That improvement does not appear to have occurred as Trump last week threatened an additional $200 billion in tariffs against China. CNBC could not find a move of 1 percent or higher to the upside linked to any news that tariffs would be increased. That's a pretty clear sign that equity investors are failing so far to see the economic upside for markets from higher tariffs or a trade war. \u2014 With reporting by Christopher Hayes and Benjamin Berna.

Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, with a market capitalization of $64 billion, compared with General Electric's $110 billion market cap, was not the obvious choice, said Cashin, managing director of UBS Financial Services. But the addition of a tech giant, such as one of the FAANG stocks, would have been a mistake too. \"Am I surprised at Walgreens? I'm stunned,\" Cashin told Bob Pisani on \"Power Lunch\" Wednesday. \"But I can understand from a price basis why they did it.\" \"The problem with replacing GE, if you put one of these mega monsters in, an Amazon or something like that, it would absolutely swallow the whole average, because it is based on price, not on capitalization,\" said Cashin, who has worked at the New York Stock Exchange for more than 50 years. In fact, all of the tech giants are significantly higher: Amazon has a market cap of more than $850 billion. Google is valued at approximately $830 billion. Facebook has a market cap of about $587 billion, and Netflix is about $181 billion. \"The primary concern was not to bring in any tech that looked like it might wind up swallowing or distorting the Dow,\" he said. \"If the Dow began to part company with all the rest of the indices, you'd have people questioning its validity.\" On Tuesday, GE was removed from the Dow, to be replaced by Walgreens starting June 26. Still, the move is not a surprise to everyone. GE has had a bad year: It was the worst-performing stock in the index, and shares have dropped more than 55 percent in 12 months. Worse yet, now that the industrial giant is out of the Dow, some index funds are no longer required to own the stock. Former GE Power Systems President and CEO Bob Nardelli said GE was \"weighting down the Dow.\" \"It's been rumored for a while,\" Nardelli said Tuesday on \"Fast Money.\" \"And when people use that as a barometer for investment, I'm not surprised that they decided to transition GE out.\" General Electric's stock was down about 0.4 percent Wednesday 2 p.m. ET on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow consists of 30 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. GE was one of the original components of the blue-chip index when it was created in 1896 and has been listed on the index for more than 100 years.

Cryptocurrency fundraising has brought in billions of dollars this year, mostly from retail investors. The process known as an initial coin offering exposes those investors to serious risks, according to the CEO of Nasdaq. \"To make it no rules at all, when companies can just willy-nilly take people's money and offer no information at all, with no governance, that sounds to me like you're taking advantage of people,\" Adena Friedman said at the Future of Fintech conference in New York Wednesday. The victims are typically first-time investors, like \"Auntie Mae in Iowa,\" and have almost no access to information, she said. While the Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to provide retail investors the same information as banks or bigger investors in IPOs, this cryptocurrency process has almost no oversight. \"In ICO space none of that is available, and it's all being bought by retail,\" Friedman said. \"I have real concern on lack of transparency, oversight, and accountability that these companies have as they're going out to raise capital through an ICO.\" In an initial coin offering, or ICO, coins or tokens are put up for sale as a form of crowdfunding. Instead of voting rights or dividends that come with shares of a company, \"utility tokens\" promise access to a network, platform or service. But they're often backed by an abstract idea or nothing at all. In late May, Cayman Islands start-up Block.one had raised $4 billion, eclipsing the world's biggest initial public offerings on stock exchanges this year while its flagship product was not even live yet. The SEC has cracked down on ICOs, which raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to research firm Autonomous Next. The financial watchdog has warned of pump-and-dump schemes in ICOs, shut some down and charged one backed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid with fraud. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said he hasn't seen an ICO that doesn't classify as a security. \"I sympathize with SEC saying these are really securities offerings,\" Friedman said. \"I support the SEC on that.\" Friedman told CNBC in April that once regulation is smoothed out and the space \"matures,\" Nasdaq would consider becoming a digital-currency exchange. But for now, she said, Nasdaq is taking the partnership route. In April, the company announced a collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by early bitcoin investors Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss.

In fact, over the last three to four months, almost every sizeable market sell-off has come from pro-inflation policies out of Washington, D.C., the CEO and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors said. \"There is a major sea change going on in the backdrop where we're going from a disinflationary environment to an inflationary environment,\" Bernstein said on \"Closing Bell.\" \"We have tight labor markets, we have tight product markets because the economy is strong. We just got tax cuts on top of that. We're now getting fiscal spending,\" he added. In addition, there are trade issues and immigration restrictions in play now. \"They are all pro-inflation policies and that's the big issue in the background here,\" said Bernstein. U.S. stocks dropped Tuesday as fears of a trade war increased. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 287.26 points to close at 24,700.21, erasing all of its gains for the year. The action came after President Donald Trump said late Monday that he asked the United States trade representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent. Beijing has pledged to fight back. It was the latest salvo in escalating trade tensions with China. On Friday, the U.S. announced a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion of Chinese products. The Asian nation then said it would slap retaliatory tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods. show chapters Stocks close lower on trade concerns 4:53 PM ET Tue, 19 June 2018 | 03:34 James Bianco, president of Bianco Research, told \"Closing Bell\" that right now the markets are suggesting that the U.S. is going to win any protracted trade war. That's because the U.S. stock market drop wasn't as large as the one in China, he said. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 0.40 percent, while the Shanghai composite fell 3.82 percent. And while there is the \"nuclear option\" of the Chinese deciding to sell their U.S. Treasurys or devalue their currency, neither one of those markets are acting like that's a viable option right now, he said. \"For the moment, the president seems to have all of the cards and the Chinese are trying to play along,\" Bianco noted. Earlier in the day, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein weighed in at a luncheon interview at the Economic Club of New York, saying he didn't think the two countries would mutually destroy their economies. \"I don't think we're in a suicide pact on this,\" Blankfein said.

But as market lore goes, this piece of advice may now be injurious to your financial wealth. It's true that buying on any dips as a strategy in recent years has stood investors well. The combination of central bank quantitative easing (QE) and low-bond yields has forced investors to take on more equity market risk in the hope of improving returns. The old market trope suggests bull markets instead die of excess \u2014 too much hubris, and too much leverage. But there is one more reason: policy mistakes. Whether it is the Federal Reserve lifting rates too quickly, or President Donald Trump igniting a trade war spark that turns into a brushfire, policy risk hovers on the edge of investors' peripheral vision like a bad tempered wasp at a picnic. There are clearly still arguments in support of equity markets. Namely, strong earnings and a moderation in share prices since the start of the year that has improved the valuation picture. Nandini Ramakrishnan, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan, is still positive. \"In the second half of the year, we expect some reacceleration of growth outside the US as\u2026 employment growth and cheap credit\u2026 reassert themselves,\" she said. \"We expect modest gains in equity prices by year-end as government bond price drift lower.\" The team at J.P. Morgan still sees improvements in productivity emerging in the U.S. that will underpin markets there. But, the escalator of fear around a tit-for-tat trade war and rising interest rates is beginning to unnerve investors. Ralph Jainz, who manages money at Centricus Asset Management, said: \"Central bank support is starting to fade, even as the global demand environment is deteriorating.\" He thinks investors need to start positioning themselves for a market that is rolling over: \"We would expect a full-blown trade war in European equities to start in H1 2019 at the latest.\" show chapters Famed bear David Tice reveals what worries him about stocks right now 4:18 PM ET Wed, 11 April 2018 | 04:28 As for the argument that bull markets die in euphoria, Jainz said it was a question of looking in the right place: tech stocks. \"Technology is undoubtedly in a bubble, and overheating phase. That is clear from looking at the gap between growth (e.g. tech) stocks and value (e.g. banks) which is at its highest since Q1 2000.\" For some, the markets are already involved in a long drawn-out topping process. Stewart Richardson, CIO at RMG Investment Management, said this growth cycle is getting old. \"This cycle is similar to other cycles, in that previous loose policies encouraged new debt that will eventually prove not to be serviceable and will have to be written down,\" he said. \"The build-up in corporate debt in particular\u2026 is of concern.\" While Richardson acknowledged there may be further upside for equities because of the strength of the U.S. economy, markets are living on borrowed time. \"Equity markets have struggled to make progress in recent months. What's important to try and understand (assuming we are late cycle), is that we are dealing now with a sequence of outcomes that will lead to increasingly less good and then bad outcomes.\" The bears have not had an easy time in this phase of the markets. February's volatility melted away, once again encouraging the bulls to increase their weightings in risk assets. But potential triggers for renewed weakness abound: debt levels, margin pressures, valuations, interest rates etc \u2014 choose your excuse. But ultimately, confidence is key, and investor, and business, confidence appears increasingly dented by the risk of mistakes on trade and monetary policy. And that explains why the bears have woken up again. The National and CNBC International are global content sharing partners.

The days when insurance was all about financial compensation are gone \u2014 coping with that major shift has been a challenge that a top industry executive admits he's still trying to keep up with. That sentiment from Benoit Claveranne, AXA's chief executive for international and new markets, came just months after the largest insurer in France announced a restructuring plan to simplify its operations. The company removed two layers of management and reorganized its business units to handle new challenges in the industry. \"International and new markets\" is one of the five business units formed after the restructuring. Claveranne leads a team tasked with running AXA's business in 30 \"fast-growing\" and \"extremely innovative\" markets. \"If I was happy with our progress, I should be fired,\" Claveranne told CNBC in an interview late last month. \"So, how do we do? I think we're promising but we're always telling ourselves we should go faster because there are still too many things in which we believe we can do better,\" he added. Courtesy of AXA Benoit Claveranne is CEO for international and new markets at AXA, France's largest insurer. Outlining the industry changes AXA is dealing with, the executive said customers now expect more from their insurers. In addition to financial compensation, people now want support to minimize the impact that an unfortunate incident has on their lives. That means, for example, health insurance must go beyond covering the treatment for illnesses to offering support for psychological or counselling services that patients may need, he explained. Increasingly, people also want insurance policies that cover \"nothing more, nothing less\" than what they need, the CEO explained. Such options may not as widely available yet, but insurers can help consumers better understand the risks they face to prevent accidents or buy insurance that meets their needs, he said. AXA in October last year launched a website in six European countries to help people gauge the risks of water leakage and theft at their homes. On the site, people can learn of the frequency of those occurrences and the costs to fix them \u2014 data previously used only internally to design and price insurance products. \"The world of yesterday, where I just give you money for a claim, is over,\" said Claveranne. \"Our job is to say: 'How do we cover these things more and more?' and 'How do we cover them in a different way?'\" Emerging markets are the 'future growth engine' In the countries that Claveranne oversees, AXA's presence is small compared to its stronghold in Europe and the United States. But being relatively new in some of those markets has allowed AXA to try new ways of doing business, he added. For example, selling insurance directly to consumers through digital channels immediately after setting up a presence without getting bogged down by legacy systems and practices, Claveranne explained. And those markets have the potential to grow so much more. Those countries \u2014 which include Brazil, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and India \u2014 delivered 300 million euros (just under $350 million) in earnings in 2017. That's a 20 percent jump from the prior year but just 4.8 percent of the company's total earnings for the year, according to the AXA's annual report. \"The job of my team and I is to make sure that in the next three to 10 years, much of the future growth engine of AXA will come from us,\" he said. \"The segment already grew by 20 percent in one year. I think we can more than double that income in the next few years.\" ", "author": "Christian Hartmann | Reuters", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/axas-benoit-claveranne-on-insurance-industry-changes-trends.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Christian Hartmann", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "France", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Axa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Nanterre", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Paris", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Benoit Claveranne", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "France", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "five", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "30", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Claveranne", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "late last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AXA Benoit", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "France", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "October last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "six", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "yesterday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Claveranne", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Claveranne", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Europe", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Claveranne", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Brazil", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Morocco", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the United Arab Emirates", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "300 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "just under $350 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the prior year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "just 4.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the next three to 10 years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AXA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "one year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the next few years", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Benoit Claveranne, AXA's chief executive for international and new markets, talks about the trends shaping the global insurance industry.", "title": "Major changes are coming to insurance coverage, CEO says", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/20/105283286-RTSKHQO.jpg?v=1529484232"}, {"time": "2018-06-21T21:46:47-0400", "body": " show chapters This area of crypto market could be in bubble territory 9:13 PM ET Thu, 21 June 2018 | 05:38 Initial coin offerings (ICOs) continue to overflow the crypto universe, but bitcoin bull Brian Kelly told CNBC that the market is overvalued. He said investors are in a \"wait-and-see mode.\" \"People are starting to say, 'I'm going to put the brakes on the ICOs right now. I've got my portfolio. I don't need a seventh or eighth ICO,'\" the cryptocurrency investor said on \"Fast Money\" Thursday. \"To me, [ICOs are] not as hot as they used to be.\" In fact, Kelly said the market for ICOs, or initial coin offerings, a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures, is \"very frothy.\" There have been more than 300 ICOs launched in the first half of 2018 \u2014 nearly the same amount as all of 2017. And to date, in the first six months of this year, more money has been raised. TaTaTu, a social entertainment platform, raised $575 million off the sale of its tokens. Rapper Akon is planning on launching his own cryptocurrency, aptly named \"Akoin,\" to be used in \"Akon Crypto City,\" which will be located in the West African city of Senegal. Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, pointed out that the U.S. is not a big player in the ICO market. Asia, particularly countries where regulatory issues may be less of a concern, is. Another shift: a lot of the ICOs have been funded with U.S. dollars and not cryptocurrencies. Kelly said he's noticed a lot of investors, who were buying into the ICO craze, \"are actually looking to buy ether, to buy bitcoin, to buy some of these big protocols, these platforms that everything is being built on.\" Meanwhile, bitcoin remains at a near-standstill.

Euro zone finance ministers agreed in the early hours of Friday a debt relief package for Greece and a new disbursement of 15 billion euros as part of its current 86-billion-euro bailout program, the head of euro zone finance ministers said. The deal involves a 10-year extension of maturities on loans from the European Financial Stability Facility and a 10-year deferral on interest payments, Mario Centeno told a news conference. Centeno added that this will allow Greece to issue bonds across the yield curve. Athens is also likely to pay lower borrowing costs on its new bonds as the new package of aid will help set up a cash buffer totaling 24.1 billion euros that would cover Greek financing needs for 21 months, Centeno said. Greece says deal positive, debt now viable Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said on Friday a deal extending and deferring repayments on part of Greece's debt pile sent a clear signal to markets that the country had turned a corner from crises which rattled it in the past. Euro zone finance ministers on Friday offered Greece a 10-year deferral and maturities extension on a large part of past loans as well as 15 billion euros in new credit to ensure Athens can stand on its own feet after it exits its bailout in August. \"I have to say that the Greek government is happy with this deal. We consider that debt is now viable, we can now have access to the markets .. But at the same time this government will not forget what the Greek people went through in the past eight years,\" Tsakalotos told reporters. Greece's current international bailout, the country's third rescue program since 2010, ends in August. \"I think this is the end of the Greek crisis, I think Greece is turning a page, I think it has all the building blocks there to leave the program with confidence that we can access the markets and we can implement our growth strategy and turn the agenda away from one of fiscal adjustment .. to one of growth,\" Tsakalotos said. IMF welcomes deal but has reservations he International Monetary Fund welcomed on Friday the deal on debt relief for Greece, saying it will improve debt sustainability in the medium term, but maintained reservations on the long term. \"The additional debt relief measures announced today will mitigate Greece medium-term financing risks and improve medium term debt prospects,\" the International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde told a news conference.

Competition for technology is a major driver in the surge of mergers and acquisitions in 2018. Four out of 10 acquisitions of technology companies have come from companies in other industries, PricewaterhouseCoopers' deals team said in their mid-year review and outlook released Thursday. The consumer and retail industry has made the most purchases of tech companies, accounting for 32 percent of cross-sector deals involving tech, the report said. Share of tech acquisitions by non-tech firms, 2018 Source: PwC For example, Nordstrom announced in March it bought two digital retail start-ups: a sales communications platform called BevyUp and a brands-to-customer texting service called MessageYes. In media, Gannett said in May that it has agreed to buy cloud-based digital marketing company WordStream for $130 million. The focus on buying tech firms comes as companies overall are increasingly interested in deals in other industries. One-third of megadeals this year have crossed sector lines, the PwC report said. \"Looking ahead, we can expect to see more \u2013 and larger \u2013 convergence deals, continuing the blurring of industry lines,\" Curt Moldenhauer, PwC's U.S. deals solutions leader and China inbound deals leader, said in a emailed statement to CNBC. Mergers and acquisitions overall are on the rise. The bidding war for 21st Century Fox assets picked up after a federal judge cleared the way last week for AT&T to buy Time Warner for $85 billion. The number of deals larger than $5 billion so far this year is on track to double last year's total, PwC said, citing its analysis of Thomson Reuters data. Overall deal value is up by more than 50 percent, the report said. The analysts cited rising oil prices, U.S. tax reform and the U.S. approval of the AT&T-Time Warner tie-up as positive drivers for further mergers and acquisitions. But the most important factor is the record amount of capital companies have on hand to make purchases, the report said. \"It's likely here to stay for the foreseeable future and will eclipse all other economic variables influencing deal values through the rest of 2018 and beyond.\" ", "author": "Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/retail-companies-trying-to-catch-up-to-the-times-are-scrambling-to-buy-tech-start-ups.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Daniel Acker", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Peoria", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Illinois", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Four", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "10", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "PricewaterhouseCoopers", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "mid-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "32 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Nordstrom", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "BevyUp", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "MessageYes", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Gannett", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "WordStream", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$130 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "One-third", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PwC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Curt Moldenhauer", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "PwC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "21st Century", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fox", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AT&T", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Time Warner", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$85 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "last year's", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PwC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Thomson Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 50 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the AT&T-Time Warner", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Four out of 10 acquisitions of technology companies have come from companies in other industries, PricewaterhouseCoopers deals team said a report Thursday.", "title": "Retail companies trying to catch up to the times are scrambling to buy tech start-ups", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/16/105134226-GettyImages-180237152.jpg?v=1523886947"}, {"time": "2018-06-21T11:34:50-0400", "body": " VCG | Getty Images Jim Rogers, American businessman, investor and author. Jim Rogers is the latest investing guru to venture away from active management by attaching his name to an exchange-traded fund. The Rogers AI Global Macro ETF (BIKR) launches Thursday in New York. It's based on an index that tracks a model Rogers, 75, and his team at Ocean Capital Advisors have created using machine learning to analyze global economic data. The ETF, which primarily follows U.S.-listed single-country ETFs, will rebalance monthly based on that analysis. \"We think it will hit a particular segment of the market that has followed Jim and is interested in following him in an ETF,\" said Sam Masucci, founder and CEO of ETF Managers Group, Ocean's partner in launching the fund. The fund's launch follows that of the NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF (BOON) in February. Noted oil investor T. Boone Pickens' firm, BP Capital Advisors, and the New York Stock Exchange created the fund to track both producers and consumers of U.S. oil and gas. Pickens, 90, has disclosed his health is declining and announced in January the closure of his hedge fund. BP Capital will still operate its energy-focused mutual funds. BOON is up 7 percent this quarter. \"If you have the brand that these investors do, you might as well leverage it,\" said Matt Markiewicz, former director at BlackRock iShares and director at Innovation Shares, which launched a blockchain ETF this year. \"Half of the ETF game is about marketing and distribution,\" he said. Rogers co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros in the 1970s, which in its heyday gave investors massive outperformance versus the S&P 500. Rogers then went on to launch the Rogers International Commodity Index, which is up more than 140 percent from August 1998 to December. He is now chairman at Ocean Capital Advisors. \"The internet and artificial intelligence are changing and have changed everything we know including finance and investing; Ocean's new ETF is part of the same trend,\" Rogers said in a statement. \"I hope we get it right. We will all be extremely pleased someday if we do.\" Exchange-traded products track a basket of stocks or assets. The funds trade on exchanges like stocks, and their low fees have drawn investors away from the traditional, typically more expensive route of hiring a money manager to actively pick stocks. That said, it's unclear whether strategies well-known investors have used to make a fortune in hard assets such as commodities will translate well to an ETF. Simply having the brand of a well-known investor may also not be enough to attract money in the crowded world of exchange-traded funds. \u2014 CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.

Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, a global decentralized currency that is based on blockchain technology, said it was to be expected. \"Whenever there's an exchange hack, people get scared and the price drops,\" Lee said on \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. \"It happens all the time.\" \"Whenever there's some bad news like an exchange hack, the prices drop like 5 percent,\" he said. \"Five percent is a lot in the stock market world, but it's like nothing in the crypto space.\" Bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap, fell from $6,718.35 to $6,561.79 Wednesday after news that the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb was hacked and $30 million of coins were stolen. By Wednesday evening at 5:30 p.m. ET, bitcoin had rebounded to more $6,700 in what Kelly called a \"mini uptrend.\" The two traders explain why. 1. Bithumb acted quickly Kelly said as soon as the news was reported the exchange took action. \"They halted withdrawals and they put everything into cold storage,\" he said. 2. Exchange paid back investor losses Bithumb used its own money to pay back investors. \"They immediately said, 'Any losses, we have reserves. We're going to pay for them. Nobody loses money,\" Kelly said. 3. Fundamentals Lee said when an exchange is hacked, it doesn't affect the fundamentals of the underlying coins. He likened it to a bank robbery. If a bank gets broken into and gold is stolen, Lee said, it doesn't affect the price of gold. \"So same with bitcoin,\" he said. \"If an exchange doesn't protect their coins well enough and it gets hacked, it doesn't really change the fundamentals of the coin that they're protecting.\" Additionally, a report released on Wednesday, by a Washington law firm, stated that the cryptocurrency firm Tether has enough U.S. dollar reserves to back its digital coins. The report came on the heels of investor concerns that the firm may not have actually had the reserves to back up its coins. \"The past few years people have been scared that Tether has been printing their Tether coins out of thin air and buying bitcoin with it, which might be the cause of last year's run up,\" Lee said. \"And if they actually do have the USD backing that means that the run-up is created by real demand and not fake demand. That's really good news.\" Investors have to protect their cryptocurrency better Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, advised investors to hold their cryptocurrency in cold storage \u2014 which involves storing it offline \u2014 if possible. Exchanges are \"kinda the weak point here,\" Kelly said on \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. Lee added that the cryptocurrency industry is relatively new, and exchanges are still learning to protect their funds. \"People have to get used to that, they really need to protect their coins much better than traditional finance,\" he said. - Reuters contributed to this report.

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has lined up $548 million from seven cornerstone investors including U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm for its Hong Kong IPO of up to $6.1 billion, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters. Xiaomi, which also makes internet-connected devices, has set a price range of HK$17 to HK$22 ($2.17 to $2.80) each for its listing in the Asian financial hub, one of the biggest tech floats globally in recent years, showed the term sheet. Other cornerstone investors include Chinese express delivery company SF Express, domestic telecom service provider China Mobile, state-backed investment firm CICFH Entertainment and state-run conglomerate China Merchants Group. The seven will take up a combined 10 percent of the shares being offered in the IPO, and the company will open the book to institutional investors on Thursday, according to the term sheet. Xiaomi and China Mobile declined to comment. China Merchants Group, CICFH Entertainment, Qualcomm and SF Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The IPO values the Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled company at $54.3 billion - or $70.3 billion after a 15 percent \"greenshoe\" or over-allotment option which can be sold if there is demand. If the greenshoe is exercised, Xiaomi's free float will be 9.99 percent of its enlarged share capital. Xiaomi is selling about 2.18 billion shares in the IPO, 65 percent of which are primary, according to the term sheet. The selling shareholders are early investor Morningside, a Chinese venture capital firm, and Xiaomi managers Wong Kong Kat, Liu De, Heng Feng and Li Wanqiang. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Xiaomi lowered its likely valuation to a range of $55 billion to $70 billion following its decision to delay its mainland share offering until after its Hong Kong IPO. The delay was triggered by a dispute between the company and regulators over the valuation of its China depositary receipts (CDRs), sources said, casting doubt on Beijing's efforts to lure foreign-listed Chinese tech giants back home. Xiaomi had been expected to raise up to $10 billion, split between its Hong Kong and mainland offerings. The delay to its CDRs is a blow for Chinese officials, who designed them as a means for China to compete globally for major tech listings and give mainland investors access to the country's tech champions. Xiaomi's blockbuster Hong Kong offering on the other hand is set to be the first listing under new exchange rules designed to attract tech floats, as competition heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland. China's largest provider of on-demand online services, Meituan-Dianping, also plans to file for a Hong Kong IPO later this week, which would be the city's second multibillion-dollar tech float this year, said people familiar with the matter. Meituan-Dianping declined to comment. The people declined to be identified as the information was not yet public. Xiaomi was set up in 2010 and doubled its smartphone shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest maker, showed data from Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales. CLSA, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Xiaomi's Hong Kong IPO.

Test results made public on Thursday by the Fed show that large and regional U.S. banks have enough capital to withstand the crisis scenarios used in the test. This year 38 banks went through the ringer, though three banks ended up being exempted because of a new law that set a minimum size of $100 billion of assets for those required to participate. It is the fourth straight year all the banks met the Fed's standards. That helped bolster arguments from Republican lawmakers that regulations on the industry could be loosened without adverse effects. The test is not \"pass/fail,\" but coming through the worst-case scenario is seen as a positive. \"Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,\" said Fed Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles in a statement. Analysts expected banks clear the hurdle by wide margins, though they were closely watching results from the six foreign banks new to the annual ritual this year. In addition to the biggest U.S. banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase and others, this year's test included UBS, RBC, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Barclays. On a background call with reporters Thursday, senior Fed officials said the test had been run on three banks that ended up being exempted, and it was up to those firms to decide whether to release their results. They are CIT Group, Comerica and Zions Bancorp. The largest U.S. banks showed they had adequate capital to withstand the harshest scenario, clearing above the minimum requirement. But Goldman Sachs disputed the Fed's numbers. \"Our models and the Federal Reserve's models diverge, which we expect to discuss with the Federal Reserve,\" the bank said in a statement on Thursday. The \"ratios that are published today may not represent our firm's actual capital return capacity, which may be higher than this year's test would otherwise indicate.\" In the Thursday afternoon briefing for reporters, the senior Fed officials said this week's test numbers aren't necessarily reflective of what next week's results will look like, when banks are given approval on their capital plans or told to make adjustments. The Fed does this exercise annually to make sure banks and other financial companies have enough capital to survive after the 2008 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the system. This year's hypothetical scenarios were harsher than past tests, analysts noted. The test imagined unemployment, currently near historic lows, at 10 percent and an environment where there was extreme stress in corporate lending and real estate lending. Credit cards and commercial loans showed the most stress. Under this severe scenario, the 35 banks would lose $578 billion over the nine quarters tested, the Fed said. Since 2009, the banks in the group have added $800 billion in common equity capital to their balance sheets to shore up for another downturn.

An exchange-traded fund tracking shares of large Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong has posted its longest losing streak since 2012. The iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) closed more than 2 percent lower Thursday. That marks 11 straight days of decline for the first time since a 13-day losing streak ended May 18, 2012. The prolonged sell-off comes amid escalation in a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump said late Monday that he has asked the U.S. trade representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for an additional 10 percent tariff. The announcement followed China's announcement of planned tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, in retaliation against the Trump administration's list of duties on $50 billion of Chinese goods released earlier that day. A portion of those tariffs are initially set to take effect July 6. The S&P 500 remains more than 1.5 percent higher for June, while the Shanghai composite is down 7 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is down more than 3.5 percent. Among FXI's components, lens manufacturer Sunny Optical is the worst performer so far this week, down more than 12.5 percent. The stock has soared more than 100 percent over the last 12 months. Citic Securities, a major Chinese investment bank, was the second-worst performer, down nearly 10.8 percent for the week so far. Its shares are unchanged over the last 12 months. Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE is the third-worst performer this week, down more than 10.5 percent. The shares plunged after breaking a near two-month trading halt last week in the wake of settlement with the U.S. over sanctions violations. Chinese tech giant Tencent, by far the largest company in FXI, has fallen 3 percent so far this week. The stock has run up 41 percent over the last 12 months. \u2014 CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.

Shares of competitor Chipotle Mexican Grill are also up year to date. In fact, the company is making a comeback after a three-year-long sales slump fueled by a series of food-borne illness outbreaks and bad reviews. Earlier this year, the company began capitalizing on speed by allowing customers to order on an app and pick up the food at a drive-through window. Chipotle is testing new potential items for its menu this week. \"The speed of service is something the company is squarely focused on right now,\" Hottovy said.

Still, Morningstar placed a hold rating on both Chipotle and Darden and said the companies could benefit from better workforce training, new products and improved order of operations. \"There's a lot of excitement that comes from [stocks surging], but you have to balance that with ... some tempered margin expectations,\" Hottovy said.

Analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak raised his 12-month price target on the video-streaming giant to $500 from $420 per share. Wlodarczak's new price target implies a 20 percent upside from Netflix's close on Wednesday. \"We expect yet another solid result (and 3Q guidance) in the seasonally weaker 2Q driven by content launches, aggressive increases in marketing spend and the natural momentum of the business,\" Wlodarczak said in a note to clients. He also said the recently approved AT&T-Time Warner acquisition could boost Netflix shares moving forward. \"We view the close of the AT&T/TWX deal as a potential nice positive for NFLX in regards to picking up TWX talent and likely weakening a global competitor (HBO) as AT&T is likely to find it very difficult to mash together two extremely disparate operating cultures.\" Netflix shares rose to an all-time intraday high before closing 0.3 percent lower. On Tuesday, GBH Insights raised its price target to $500 from $400, citing higher levels of engagement versus its competitors Amazon and Hulu. The two are the highest price forecasts on Wall Street. Netflix shares have been on fire lately, notching a record high on Wednesday and skyrocketing 120 percent over the past six months. Other so-called FANG stocks like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet also hit all-time highs in the previous session. \"NFLX offers consumers an increasingly compelling unique entertainment experience on virtually any device, w/o commercials at a relatively low cost,\" Wlodarczak said. \"The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows (and their ARPU increases) the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service \u2026 and dramatically increases barriers to entry, boosted by continued material increases in broadband availability/speeds globally.\" Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.

There's lots of capital in the system now, and banks should be allowed to return what they think is appropriate with a reasonable amount of reserves for recessions and so forth,\" he said in an interview with \"Closing Bell.\" The Fed tests banks with a minimum size of $100 billion of assets \u2014 a new, higher level this year \u2014 on their ability to withstand another economic crisis. The latest stress test results were released on Thursday afternoon. While 38 banks underwent examination, three were excluded because they did not hit the new $100 billion threshold. The remaining 35 banks were found to have sufficient capital. But what investors are really waiting to find out is what banks can pay out in dividends and in buybacks, which will be revealed next week. The Fed will either approve or disapprove of the banks' plans. The tests are a result of the Dodd-Frank reforms instituted in the wake of the financial crisis. Kovacevich acknowledged there are risks with banks deciding what to return to shareholders. \"If you're wrong, you may get in trouble. But, hey that's capitalism,\" he said. Tom Brown, founder and CEO of Second Curve Capital, is \"all in favor\" of getting rid of the Fed's stress tests. \"We'd go back to what we had before. We had capital standards,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" However, there is one big difference from the old standards \u2014 there is now a liquidity test on the banks as part of Dodd-Frank, said Brown. And that's more important than capital, he noted. Jeffrey Harte, principal at Sandler O'Neill, agrees. \"Banks failing is all about liquidity. The liquidity-coverage ratio goes a long way to removing the next financial crisis,\" he said. \"That's really what people should be looking at beyond just what the capital levels are as to how safe the bank system is. It's really awash in liquidity right now.\" \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.

machine in Tokyo. Bitcoin prices fell roughly 9 percent Friday after Japan's financial regulator ordered several cryptocurrency exchanges to improve their practices against money laundering. The digital currency fell to $6,081, breaking below $6,400 for the first time in about a week and reaching its lowest level since February 6, according to CoinDesk. The order from Japan's Financial Services Agency led bitFlyer \u2014 the country's largest crypto exchange \u2014 to suspend the creation of new accounts while it makes improvements, especially in its measures to stop money laundering and terrorist financing. \"Our management and all employees are united in our understanding of how serious these issues are, as well as how serious we are in responding to them going forward,\" bitFlyer said in a statement on its website. Bitcoin's Friday performance Source: CoinDesk \"In order to maximize our efforts towards building a suitable service and improving on the issues identified, we have temporarily suspended account creation for new customers of our own volition,\" bitFlyer said. The agency gave the same order to five other exchanges after finding weaknesses in their controls against money laundering. \"In the long term, it builds a better ecosystem and makes sure this is a legitimate asset class,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM. \"This is part of making sure exchanges are up to snuff.\" In the short run, Kelly pointed out, it reduces the flow of new capital to the largest exchange in the largest market for bitcoin trading. Bitcoin trading in Japanese yen makes up more than 60 percent of the digital currency's daily volume, according to data from market analysis site CryptoCompare. show chapters Here's why central banks are scared of bitcoin 11:36 AM ET Fri, 22 June 2018 | 06:31 Mark Newton, technical analyst and founder of Newton Advisors, said even minor cryptocurrency news has the power to trigger a larger sell-off lately. \"In this choppy range with low volume, it just takes one bout of selling and the entire space goes down,\" Newton said. \"There's just a lack of interest, there's a lack of buying, and the sellers are dominating the marketplace.\" Bitcoin could see two or three more weeks of selling, and a possible pullback to $5,000 before finding a bottom, Newton said. Bitcoin prices have suffered from the lack of new buyers in 2018, dropping by more than half this year after a climb to near $20,000 in December. The entire market capitalization of the digital currency has fallen by roughly 50 percent since January, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Japanese regulators have been in the vanguard of regulation. It was the first country to adopt a national system to regulate cryptocurrency trading after its exchanges were subject to some high-profile breaches including Mt.Gox. In March, Japanese regulators issued punishment notices to multiple exchanges and forced some to stop business altogether after the $530 million theft of digital currency from exchange Coincheck. Other cryptocurrencies fell alongside bitcoin Friday. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell 9 percent, while XRP was down roughly 7 percent. Bitcoin cash and litecoin both dropped about 11 percent. \u2014Reuters contributed to this report. WATCH: Rep. Warren Davidson: We need 'light touch' regulation for ICO market show chapters Rep.

The company is making \"Circle Trade\" automated, so investors can place high frequency and block orders without talking to a human, the company announced Monday. \"In May, which was a challenging month, we saw a sharp increase of unique new counter-parties,\" Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire told CNBC in a phone interview. \"A lot of folks on the institutional side are on-boarding, and getting their ducks in the row.\" Month over month, Circle says, it had a 30 percent increase in new institutional clients and was doing 15 times more transaction volume per day from a year ago. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin fell roughly 20 percent in May. Part of the feedback from these new clients, which include family offices and venture capital firms, was that \"Circle Trade\" in its current form wasn't equipped to handle the $100,000 or $1 million high-frequency equity trades clients were used to. Until this week, Circle employees at offices in the U.S., London and Hong Kong would manually quote a price over an instant messaging platform like Skype, then authorize those trades. Circle, which facilitates roughly $2 billion in trades on the platform every month, announced Monday that the orders and settlements will now be available through an automated process. \"Major institutional investors don't go through a telephone broker. They go through an electronic interface,\" Allaire said. \"We're maturing this into a more traditional product; it's much faster and a more flexible way to trade.\" Circle Trade is one of the largest over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading desks for institutional investors, with a $250,000 minimum order size. The fintech company also operates a peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin. The company acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex in February. Bitcoin has nosedived more than 50 percent in 2018 after regulatory crackdowns on fundraising frauds, high-profile hacks and a lack of new buyers. Some bitcoin pundits have argued that more buy-in from the institutional investor class would help the crypto asset recover, after attracting a flood of investors in its 1,300 percent rise last year. Uncertainty from regulators and volatility has also prevented new, more skeptical investors from entering the market this year. Circle is one of the best-funded blockchain start-ups, with investors including Goldman Sachs and Baidu. Bitmain, best known as a crypto \"mining\" company, led the most recent $110 million strategic investment in Circle, which the company said brings its valuation close to $3 billion. The funding round also includes existing investors such as Breyer Capital, Tusk Ventures, IDG Capital, Pantera and Blockchain Capital.

Chinnappa | Reuters A worker talks on a phone as he stands in front of a wall with removed Flipkart logo outside the company's former office in Bengaluru, India May 9, 2018. Bonds issued by Walmart to fund its acquisition of Indian ecommerce company Flipkart contain controversial provisions that could be used to withhold compensation to investors if the deal is delayed. The big box retailer sold $8.5bn bonds on Wednesday whose documents contain legal language used recently by other issuers to avoid paying such compensation, in defiance of investor requests that companies stop using the language. The bonds were part of a larger $16bn debt fundraising, the second-largest globally this year after strong demand led the retailer to increase the size of the offering. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. At issue are a pair of provisions that have been standard in bond documents for years but which have been used to save issuers cash in recent months and faced criticism as a result. Walmart agreed to buy back five tranches of debt, worth $9.5bn, at 101 per cent of face value if it does not complete its purchase of a majority stake in the Indian ecommerce platform by June 7 2019, company filings show. But $8.5bn of those bonds also contained a \"make-whole call\" which could allow Walmart to buy them back at the lower face value. It is standard practice for corporate borrowers to pledge to pay compensation for deal delays, in covenants known as \"special mandatory redemption\" provisions or SMRs. Yet make-whole calls are also typical and have recently been used to redeem SMR bonds at face value when Treasury yields climbed and their value fell. AT&T and Qualcomm have both recently tried to use make-whole calls to buy back bonds at the lower price when M&A was delayed by regulator scrutiny. In March, AT&T used the manoeuvre to redeem $1.75bn of bonds at par, saving $17.5m in the process. In June Qualcomm tried a similar move for $2.75bn of debt, though it received pushback from investors in response. The two provisions \u2014 and the way they interact \u2014 have received more attention this year, as investors expect more debt-funded deals and continued Federal Reserve rate increases, while regulatory uncertainty has increased the possibility of deals being delayed. The Credit Roundtable, an industry group of institutional investors, has called for better protections for bondholders in contracts, and has proposed revised language for bond indentures that would prohibit companies from using make-whole provisions to skip the 1 per cent SMR premium. \"Consistency and transparency are cornerstones of an efficient market,\" the association said in a public letter. \"The goal of our proposed SMR language is to utilise investment grade pricing conventions and reduce complexity in order to improve market efficiency and facilitate flexible M&A pre-funding in the unsecured markets.\" The lead underwriters on the Walmart deal \u2014 Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan \u2014 declined to comment. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.

The latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs hits U.S. consumers less but American companies more, an analysis shows. Consumer goods account for just 1 percent of items on the June 15 lists from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, down from 12 percent on the April 3 list, according to a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The portion of the latest lists set for July 6 implementation also did not include cellphones, personal computers and laptops, while televisions, air conditioning and aluminum were deleted, UBS economist Tao Wang pointed out in a June 18 report. Source: Peterson Institute for International Economics. The revisions follow public pushback and come as Republicans try to hold their majority in Congress during November's midterm elections. \"They really decided not to go directly [due to] worry about the impact on voters,\" said Mary Lovely, economics professor at Syracuse University and nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. Last Friday, the U.S. and subsequently China said a first round of additional 25 percent tariffs, each targeting about $34 billion worth of imports from the other, is set to take effect July 6. A second round valued at roughly $16 billion for each country will be implemented at an unspecified date. The Trump administration is trying to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China and improve intellectual property protection, although many analysts say tariffs are not an effective way to solving those issues. The trade dispute escalated this week after President Donald Trump on Monday said he has asked the U.S. trade representative to identify an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for an additional 10 percent in tariffs. Key Chinese products subject to additional US 25% tariff Source: US Census, USTR, UBS estimates Despite some reprieve in the revised tariff lists, U.S. consumers will likely still feel the effects of higher prices down the road. The list raises costs for many U.S. companies sourcing components from overseas. The proportion of intermediate goods rose to 52 percent from 41 percent, the Peterson analysis showed. Lovely pointed out that latest list of U.S. tariffs adds more components that U.S. vehicle companies need. Key US products subject to additional China 25% tariff (effective July 6) Source: US Census; China Customs, MOC and MOF; UBS estimates. Note: For trade data not available from China's Customs and MOC statistics, we use US Census data as references. The second set of products also covers electronic integrated circuits, machines and parts for manufacturing semiconductor devices or electronic ICs, UBS' Wang noted. \"They are products the USTR identified as benefiting from China's industrial policies (e.g. 'Made in China 2025'),\" Wang said. American farmers still bear the brunt of Beijing's planned tariffs. Soybeans have remained on both the April and June lists, along with wheat and corn. The latest announcement also added a slew of seafood, and fruit and nuts. The agricultural duties will affect the Chinese people. So will tariffs on motor cars and auto parts that remained on the June list. But Beijing \"stayed far away from supply chains. They wanted to signal to the rest of the world that they are still a good place to provide value,\" Lovely said. Notably, China deleted aircraft from its latest list. That's potentially a boon to Boeing, although it still must vie with Airbus for Chinese contracts.

AMD\u2019s market share in the server and desktop chip market will surge in the next two years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The firm's analyst, Vivek Arya, raised his price target for the company's shares to $20 from $17, representing 27 percent upside to Friday\u2019s closing price. He said AMD will likely generate higher profit margins from its new products. He forecasts the company\u2019s PC and server chip market share in dollars will rise to 5 percent by year-end from 3.6 percent last year. Arya also forecasts 7 percent market share for AMD in 2019. The company\u2019s new server chips are priced two to three times higher than its older products, he noted. \"We believe the street continues to underappreciate the pricing/GM [gross profit margin] upside from AMD\u2019s mix-shift to newer Ryzen and EPYC server products, which can more than offset any risk from graphics cards sold to crypto miners,\" Arya said in a note to clients Monday. \"Execution is key, and Intel's incumbency and resources cannot be taken lightly, but we believe AMD has a generational opportunity to become materially bigger in computing.\" AMD shares are down 4.2 percent Monday. Its stock is up 54 percent this year through Friday versus the S&P 500's 3 percent return Arya reiterated his buy rating on AMD shares. He said the chipmaker is a top small- and mid-cap stock pick for the firm.

Wall Street is regrouping. Easy money has been made. The fiscal stimulus has been priced in for a long time. The Fed is an ongoing game, but the slightly easing price pressures along the U.S. yield curve are signaling surprisingly stable inflation expectations. The current mix of easy fiscal and monetary policies has produced an improving outlook for jobs and incomes: the two variables that, along with credit costs, drive three-quarters of the U.S. economy. Despite some areas of persisting weakness, the labor market situation is probably as good as it will ever get over the near term. At this point in the business cycle, we are witnessing a fully-employed economy hitting the limits of a disappointingly low labor supply. The growth of household incomes is also picking up. A 2 percent annual growth of inflation-adjusted after-tax incomes in the first four months of this year is a noteworthy improvement over a 1.7 percent gain during the prior four-month period. Surplus countries to solve trade problems The Fed\u2019s carefully paced rate hikes will most probably keep that powerful growth engine moving along in the months to come. Assuming a continuation of steady labor productivity gains, observed since the beginning of last year, a strengthening demand and output should brighten the profit outlook, especially if President Donald Trump could get some better trade numbers out of China, Europe and Japan. Most of those things are in the markets \u2014 they are discounted by efficient market pricing mechanisms. And that could be pretty boring because traders need news as a betting fodder. That\u2019s where trade disputes provide plenty of war room excitement. So, expect more sound and fury, but do keep the investment focus on economic activity and inflation. Yes, America\u2019s trade problem will be front and center for some time. That is an old and devastating story that cost the country (a) $8 trillion in net foreign debt, (b) part of those 96 millions of Americans who are out of the labor force and may now be unemployable, (c) huge and ongoing losses of intellectual property and (d) a ridicule of the U.S. markets serving as dumping grounds for countries brazenly ignoring the rules of the international trade adjustment. It is, therefore, all to the credit of the current administration to have finally screamed \u201cenough.\" But, having forcefully raised the problem, the White House dropped the ball. Instead of controlling the trade issues through the highest-level political dialogue with China and Europe, the president\u2019s office has allowed that essential item of national security to slip into a maze of bureaucratic channels, recriminations and clumsy tariff hits. Now, the White House looks like a supplicant when it tries to retrieve the control of the trade negotiating process with pleas to the Chinese and the Europeans not to retaliate. That\u2019s unfortunate, but China, Europe and Japan should see some silver lining here. They should relent and bring the trade issue back up to the policy level where the White House should have kept it all along. Playing the role of self-appointed champions of the rules-based multilateralism and unbridled globalization, they should recognize that they have to bring down their destabilizing and unsustainably large $595.4 billion surplus on American trades. Follow South Korea\u2019s example Putting aside Washington\u2019s rhetorical excesses, China and Europe know that the U.S. does not want to destroy the current world order. Having used, and abused, the present international trading system \u2014 and America\u2019s unforgivable indifference to decades of its mounting debts and deficits \u2014 China and Europe should accept to rebalance a relationship that has served them so well. South Korea has shown how that\u2019s done. After the U.S. free-trade agreement with South Korea was signed on March 15, 2012, the year ended up with the Korean trade surplus of $16.6 billion. Over the next two years, the surplus soared to a record-high $28.3 billion in 2015. That\u2019s when the Koreans probably began to realize that was too much of a good thing. And, when one of the U.S. presidential candidates used colorful language during the election campaign in 2016 about America\u2019s excessive trade deficits, Seoul saw the writing on the wall. Last year, the trade surplus with the U.S. was down to $22.9 billion, and in the first four months of this year the surplus was running at an annual rate of only $15.9 billion \u2014 4.2 percent below its 2012 level. Recently, one could hear the Chinese making promises that sounded like a replica of what Seoul did. But things have changed since, and there's now belligerence. Beijing is even making light of American \u201cpetulance\u201d as Trump threatens another round of punishing trade measures that would affect $200 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S. Trump could do that: He has the upper hand, legally and morally, in this dispute. Still, diplomacy and a bit of respectful interaction could be much better, and more productive, with the Chinese core leader. Apart from that, U.S. trade relations with China are bound up in a web of war and peace issues where mistrust and mutual suspicions reign supreme. That now makes it inevitable that, at some point \u2014 and the sooner the better \u2014 Trump and his Chinese counterpart will have to negotiate an agreement on bilateral trade and investments as part of a complex set of issues, including China\u2019s contested maritime borders, peace and disarmament on the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan as a centerpiece to the sacrosanct \u201cOne-China\u201d policies. Things are very different with Europe. We are back to Henry Kissinger\u2019s old quip: \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d The European Commission is the member countries\u2019 technical secretariat. All policy decisions are taken by the European Council (a forum of heads of state and government) in a unanimous vote of 28 sovereign nations. And don\u2019t count on Germany. The country is virtually leaderless. Chancellor Angela Merkel is challenged even within her own party, and her Bavarian \u201csister party\u201d wants her to step aside. Without Germany, France cannot do anything. Its president is now embroiled in an invective-laden discourse with Eastern Europeans and Italians, and is largely ignored by countries that usually vote with Germany. That means trade issues with Europe will have to remain at technical levels to iron out differences on market access and tariff and non-tariff barriers to trans-Atlantic flows of commerce and finance. Investment thoughts Noisy trade disputes won\u2019t materially change America\u2019s economic fundamentals. And neither will they lead \u2014 with all due respect to worried American generals \u2014 to a shooting war with China. Accelerating inflation is the only big threat to the U.S. economy. Bond markets\u2019 benign inflation expectations are difficult to square with the pickup of the core personal consumption expenditure index to 1.8 percent in April from 1.5 percent in January, and with the core CPI at 2.2 percent last month. Russia and the Saudi Arabia seem willing to pump more oil to bring down America\u2019s double-digit energy price inflation. That\u2019s fine, but that won\u2019t do anything to keep the U.S. service sector (90 percent of the economy) prices from rising.

Davidson moving production overseas 1:33 PM ET Mon, 25 June 2018 | 01:40 Shares of Harley-Davidson plunged Monday after the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer said it will begin shifting some production overseas to offset the impact of retaliatory EU tariffs on certain U.S. goods. The statement is one of the first by a major U.S. company that implies the recently announced tit-for-tat tariffs will force it overseas, and counters the Trump administration's efforts to protect U.S. jobs by implementing tariffs. In response to U.S. duties on European steel and aluminum, the EU enacted tariffs Friday on more than $3 billion worth of U.S. goods including bourbon, yachts and motorcycles. Later Monday, President Donald Trump said he was \"surprised\" by Harley's decision. @realDonaldTrump: Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGA The EU duties on U.S.-made motorcycles were raised to 31 percent from 6 percent, Harley-Davidson said in an 8-K filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. No production will be moving to Europe as a result of the tariffs, according to the company. Harley's overseas manufacturing plants are located in countries such as Brazil, India, Australia and Thailand. The company said it will not raise retail or wholesale prices but expects an incremental cost of $2,200 per motorcycle exported from the U.S. to the EU. \"To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,\" the Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker said in the filing. Wisconsin was also the state that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. The stock closed 5.97 percent lower Monday, down 18.3 percent for the year so far. Shares have lost more than 25 percent since Trump's election. Harley sold nearly 40,000 new motorcycles last year in Europe, 16 percent of overall sales and its biggest market outside of the U.S., according to the company. The company expects the additional investment in international facilities to take at least nine to 18 months to complete. The EU tariffs reduce the company's 2018 profits by 5 to 8 percent, according to a CNBC analysis of Thomson Reuters data and Harley's cost projections. The full-year impact of $90 million to $100 million is about 15 percent of the company's annual profits. President Donald Trump has publicly thanked Harley-Davidson in the past for \"building things in America\" and criticized other companies for moving production outside the U.S. The White House said in a briefing the EU has repeatedly engaged in unfair trade practices and is trying to punish U.S. workers, but adding the administration would like to work with the EU to try and level the playing field. \"We want Harleys made here, more made here, and that\u2019s going to happen under the President\u2019s trade policies,\" Peter Navarro, White House trade advisor, said Monday on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \u2014 CNBC's Juan Aruego , Morgan Brennan and Bria Cousins contributed to this report. show chapters Harley won't raise prices due to EU tariffs 7:59 AM ET Mon, 25 June 2018 | 00:37

Bloomberg | Getty Images Attendees view the Acer Switch 7 laptop computer powered by the Intel Corp. i7 processor at the company's booth during the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Intel's surprising management turnover will have a negative impact on its share price, according to Nomura Instinet. The firm lowered its rating to neutral from buy for Intel shares, saying the search for the company's next CEO will add to concerns over its strategy. On Thursday, Intel announced the resignation of its CEO Brian Krzanich for his alleged infraction of the company's nonfraternization policy stemming from a consensual relationship. Krzanich violated the policy that said managers cannot have relationships with people who report to them either directly or indirectly, Intel said. He was replaced on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan. \u201cCEO Krzanich\u2019s departure is disappointing on multiple levels. We believe the lack of leadership will only add to the already growing uncertainty about Intel\u2019s long-term franchise,\" analyst Romit Shah said in a note to clients Monday. \"Our point is that INTC\u2019s multiple started compressing before Mr. Krzanich\u2019s departure; lack of clear leadership will likely only add to the already growing uncertainty about Intel\u2019s long-term outlook.\u201d Intel shares are down 3.5 percent Monday after the report. Its stock is up 14 percent this year through Friday versus the S&P 500's 3 percent return. Shah reduced his price target to $55 from $60 for Intel shares, representing 5 percent upside to Friday's close. The analyst also noted Intel\u2019s problems in moving to its next-generation chip manufacturing technology. The chipmaker revealed on its April 26 earnings conference call that it delayed volume production under its 10-nanometer chip manufacturing process to next year. Conversely, AMD said on its call that it plans to start next-generation 7-nanometer chip production in late 2018. One nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter. Smaller nanometer chipmaking technologies allow companies to create faster, more power-efficient chips. \u201cWe believe the most likely scenario is that Intel promotes Dr. Murthy Renduchintala who oversees most of Intel\u2019s product groups. Dr. Renduchintala is a well-respected engineer but we think won\u2019t immediately convince investors that Intel can overcome its challenges,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWe believe Intel needs to hire an external candidate such as Hock Tan at Broadcom or Sanjay Jha from GlobalFoundries that have a proven track record of driving shareholder value.\u201d Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If the industry's problems are not addressed, it will lead to a severe slowdown in the availability of fresh capital, according to the Japan International Asset Management Center Promotion (JIAM), an organization that is working with Japan's government on the drive to revive the sector. \"We need to upgrade our investment capabilities in Japan, otherwise \u2026 we cannot support our aging society,\" JIAM's representative director, Keiichi Aritomo, told CNBC. He pointed to an example: The returns from pension funds will not be sufficient to support Japan's retirees unless there's real change, he said. A high savings rate in the country \u2014 a result of a risk averse population \u2014 is exacerbating the issue. Money is not sufficiently being put to work, leading to low returns. Pension funds are also not doing well because their assets aren't being diversified enough, according to Aritomo. That all could compound into a big problem: If returns are insufficient, then support for the aged would have to be financed from taxes, which is an unrealistic option as it would become too much of a burden on young workers, he said. A mission of change So, the country is on a mission to deal with a few problems: A sales model for funds that isn't attractive to investors, poor performing investments, and talent leaving the country. \"There are too many distribution layers between investors and fund managers. And, in Japan, the distribution cost is very high,\" Aritomo said, explaining the structure that leads to high fees for mutual fund investors. \"As a result, investors often lose money by investment ... and keep on saving instead,\" he said. Household savings are therefore being underutilized, he said. Over half of Japanese households' assets are being held in bank deposits, as compared to about 13 percent in the U.S. and 33.2 percent in Europe. And those who have moved their money out of bank accounts haven't always fared so well in Japan. In fact, institutional investors have long allocated as much as 50 percent of their portfolios to low-yield Japanese government bonds, Aritomo pointed out. He added that there are few products for long-term investment, which are important for retirement. Aside from changing the distribution model and the asset allocation mix, one solution the organization is looking at is drawing portfolio managers to the country to work. They'd replace the many who have left. For a start, the organization is working to attract 30 foreign asset management and financial technology firms to Tokyo by fiscal year 2020. Do accomplish that, JIAM will provide support to businesses, including helping them acquire the appropriate licenses in Tokyo. Last year, 10 such companies agreed to establish a presence in Japan's capital. There is little that can be done, however, to address the issue of an aging and shrinking population, except to open up the country to more immigrants, according to Aritomo. But that's seen as a longstanding issue, with the country having a reputation for not being welcoming to foreigners. Aritomo called it simply a \"perception\" problem, saying that the government has been welcoming immigrants. He put it down to language barriers and an expensive cross-border remittance services posing obstacles for workers.

The firm's previous rating under another analyst was neutral. \u201cAzure has replaced Windows as the platform underpinning Microsoft's enterprise offering, and we forecast it exceeding $100 billion revenue over the next decade,\u201d Cordwell wrote. \u201cWith Office 365, Microsoft has already established a strong position in the software as a service market and there remains robust growth potential as the greater accessibility of the cloud delivery model continues to drive expansion in the user base and customers steadily upgrade from basic packages.\u201d show chapters Microsoft president calls on Congress to monitor facial recognition software 5:33 PM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 01:13 Cordwell\u2019s Microsoft price target of $125 represents 24 percent upside from Friday\u2019s close. Competition in the cloud computing space is on the rise as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services vie for dominance in the enterprising software business. The former, however, appears to be quickly establishing a foothold in the space and eating into Amazon's stronghold, with the company\u2019s share of the market jumping to 13 percent from 10 percent approximately one year ago, according to findings from Synergy Research Group and Canalys. \u201cWhile Azure is not going to establish the monopoly position that Windows enjoyed, we believe it is addressing a much larger market that is still in the early stages of development,\u201d Cordwell said. \u201cWe model Amazon Web Services and Azure reaching $185 billion and $115 billion revenue in 10 years\u2019 time, implying roughly 70 percent combined share of the market at that time.\u201d The analyst forecasts that the Redmond, Washington-based company will report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.09 and full-year EPS of $3.87, just above consensus estimates provided by FactSet. In its latest report, Microsoft posted earnings and revenue results in April that easily topped Wall Street estimates, raising its sales expectations for later in the year. At the time, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company's upcoming 2019 fiscal year will show continued revenue growth \"driven by the transition to cloud services.\u201d Overall, Microsoft's revenue grew 16 percent year over year in the quarter, according to its earnings statement. It was the third quarter of the company's 2018 fiscal year. Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent Monday morning.

In a five to four ruling, the Supreme Court said Amex rules regarding its services for merchants don't violate federal antitrust law. Shares jumped 2.2 percent. The case centered on the fees that credit card companies charge retailers for processing transactions. Amex doesn't allow merchants to offer promotions or discounts on rival cards that charge them lower fees. The government had argued that the practice sticks merchants with higher fees for Amex transactions, which are passed on to consumers whether or not an Amex card is used. In a statement, an Amex spokesman said, \"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a major victory for consumers and for American Express. It will help to promote competition and innovation in the payments industry.\" The Retail Litigation Center, a group representing retailers, said in their own statement that the decision was a loss for American consumers. \"Competition in the credit card space is sorely lacking. The Court's decision to uphold the Second Circuit's misguided approach will allow AmEx to continue to stifle competition and prevent consumers from understanding the cost of rising credit card fees.\" Observers saw it as a win for other companies like Amazon, Google and Uber that have similar models charging entities fees to access the consumers using their sites. The Justice Department originally brought the case against Amex and its larger rivals Mastercard and Visa. The argument was that merchants had no real bargaining power when it came to using their payment services. A lower court had ruled that Amex's \"anti-steering\" rules stifled competition. Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial. An appeals court added a \"two-sided\" concept that meant the government would have to show that price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders.

Still, investors might not be so certain. The coin fell below $6,000 in February. But at its highs, in December 2017, bitcoin was priced around $19,500. That translates to a price decline of more than 60 percent. While Kelly said the drop is \"painful,\" he also said it's not unusual. Cryptocurrencies are in a bear market right now, he said. \"And bear markets, we don't know where they end,\" Kelly said. \"It doesn't mean that bitcoin can't go lower. But this is by no means the funeral for bitcoin.\" Changing sentiment Surprisingly, the lows might actually be a good thing for bitcoin, Kelly said. \"When we start to declare a funeral and things get really horrible, sentiment is approaching the lows,\" he said. \"So hopefully, we'll use that funeral bug to say, 'Hey. You know what? That was near the lows.'\" And, multiple exchange hacks, including the recent hack on South Korea's Bithumb, forces regulators to make changes. On Friday, a Japanese financial regulator ordered several cryptocurrency exchanges to improve business conditions to prevent future money laundering. \"Short run it's going to be a little tough, because they're stopping new accounts from coming in,\" Kelly said of Japan's Financial Services Agency led bitFlyer, the country's largest crypto exchange. Case in point: bitcoin fell from around $6,400 to around $6,081 after the news broke Friday morning. Bitcoin's Friday performance Source: CoinDesk But Kelly said this is not a bad thing long term. \"They're cleaning up the system. They're making sure it's more robust. Making sure it's better for people,\" he said. In addition, Mt. Gox, the Japan's bitcoin exchange that shut down in 2014 after a security breach, said it might start paying back investors as early as next year. Kelly this will likely happen in the first quarter of 2019. \"Everyone thinks all of the sudden there's going to be a wave of selling.\" But he said, it's \"not happening now.\" Instead, he said traders should think long term about cryptocurrencies and less about investing in ICOs.

The 10-year yield has fallen sharply since then, last seen under 2.9 percent as a renewed wave of trade tensions gripped markets and threatened to stall global economic growth. Yields fall as prices rise. Persistent trade disagreements between President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the European Union and other economic allies have hampered market performance so far this year and kept pressure on borrowing costs. \u201cWhile trade tensions have yet to negatively impact U.S. economic data noticeably, the Fed has started to hear more concern from business contacts,\u201d Horbach said. \u201cWe see risk that such tension will impact economic data more in the coming months, even if a benign outcome comes to pass eventually.\u201d A stronger dollar, too, would likely challenge emerging market economies across the globe, Hornbach said, with Morgan Stanley predicting downside for all markets under its coverage in Asia. The dollar, which weakened throughout much of 2017, reversed direction early this year, with the ICE dollar index, which pits the greenback against a host of other currencies, back above 94. The strategist\u2019s bullish bet on Treasurys, however, isn\u2019t universal across Wall Street. Evidence of a tight labor market and healthier gross domestic product have many market watchers wondering if the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates more aggressively to cool an overheating economy. J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, for example, said in his annual shareholder letter in April that it would be reasonable to expect a 10-year Treasury note yield of 4 percent with normal growth and inflation approaching 2 percent. Still, this isn\u2019t the first time this year Morgan Stanley has highlighted troubling trends in the markets. Mike Wilson, the firm's chief equity strategist, warned clients last month that the \u201cend of easy\u201d investing was over. \u201cAfter nine years of markets outperforming the real economy, we think the opposite now applies as policy tightens,\u201d the team of Morgan Stanley strategists wrote at that time. \u201c2018 is seeing multiple tailwinds of the last nine years abate \u2014 the end of easy.\u201d Like Hornbach\u2019s, Wilson\u2019s concerns included a return of inflation, uncertain political outlook and tightening monetary policy, the lack of which helped fuel the unprecedented run in the U.S. stock market over the past nine years.

Earlier this month, Piyush Goyal, India's interim finance minister, revealed plans to set up an Asset Reconstruction Company or a \"bad bank\" aimed at absorbing the 9.5 trillion rupee bad debt in state-owned banks. Doing so would allow those banks to stay afloat by resetting their balance sheets. \"The ARC is a viable option,\" said Ismael Pili, co-head of Asian bank research at research firm CreditSights. \"But India still runs the risk of turning out like the Philippines, where bank debts end up festering for over 20 years due to deficit issues.\" ARCs have a poor track record in India, despite having been around for more than a decade. That's leaving analysts doubtful about whether adding another one to the mix will improve things further. According to CreditSights, India\u2019s current 24 ARCs only have the ability to acquire 3 percent of bad assets in the system, rendering them ineffective in alleviating India\u2019s debt woes. A \"bad bank\" also wouldn't be able to fix another problem in the system: India\u2019s weak judiciary is keeping companies from swiftly declaring insolvency, and so letting bad debt fester for longer. \u201cYou don't have a very effective judicial system,\u201d says Pili. \u201cIf you look at the recovery rate, it's quite low \u2014 just 26 percent from ARCs. And if you look at the time they took to resolve it, it was 4.3 years on average. That's one of the highest out there.\u201d A recovery rate is the extent to which defaulted loans can be recovered. What India really needs is more capital. Earlier this year, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a $14 billion capital injection to rescue public banks, but experts said that isn\u2019t enough. At least $20 to $50 billion is needed, they said, for those banks to even meet minimum regulatory requirements. \"Unless the government is willing to put in their own money,\u201d said Prateek Khawar, director at asset manager Avendus Capital, \u201cI personally don't believe that creating ARCs and expecting private participation of capital (from ARCs) will further solve any issues.\" Meanwhile, the systemic nature of India\u2019s debt makes it a challenging problem to tackle: The bad debt includes important parts of the economy beyond just the financial system. In fact, some of the biggest defaulters for India\u2019s state-owned banks are large steel and energy companies like Bhushan Steel, Electro Steels and Monnet Ispat. \u201cA lot of these problems are systemic as well as structural,\u201c said Manish Tewari, a practicing lawyer in the Supreme Court of India. \u201cIt is extremely imperative that we need to take a nuanced view of what is happening when it comes to building a solution in India.\u201d ", "author": "Adeel Halim | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/india-proposes-new-fix-for-bad-debt-problem-it-may-not-be-enough.html", "keywords": [{"term": " Adeel Halim", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Indian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Piyush Goyal", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "an Asset Reconstruction Company", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "9.5 trillion", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "ARC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ismael Pili", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Asian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "CreditSights", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Philippines", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "over 20 years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "more than a decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CreditSights", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "24", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Pili", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "just 26 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "4.3 years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Narendra Modi", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$14 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "At least $20 to $50 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Prateek Khawar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Avendus Capital", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bhushan Steel", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Electro Steels", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Manish Tewari", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Supreme Court of India", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "India", "category": "GPE"}], "description": "India made the case for an Asset Reconstruction Company to tackle the debt that is crippling state-owned banks.

Ground zero for the robot takeover of financial services is an HSBC branch in midtown Manhattan. Here, crowds of camera phone-toting tourists cooed and clapped at Pepper, an adorable 4-foot-tall robot with a high-pitched voice and a tablet screen strapped to its chest, during a recent test run. HSBC executives are posting seven of the machines, created by SoftBank Robotics, in the lobby of their Fifth Avenue branch starting Tuesday to interact with customers and signal that the London-based bank is serious about technology. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d Pepper asks in a cheerful voice, urging onlookers to select among a half-dozen options, including tutorials on self-service channels like mobile banking and ATMs. In one demonstration, after pitching a credit card and summoning a human colleague to help close the deal, Pepper helped a user kill time by dancing hypnotically to a techno beat. The robot also poses for selfies and tells jokes. show chapters Here\u2019s how human Sophia The Robot actually is 4:29 PM ET Tue, 14 Aug 2018 | 10:16 After decades of portrayals in science fiction, robots are beginning to appear in everyday settings, doing menial tasks from vacuuming homes to flipping burgers. In finance, big banks including J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America have focused on software rather than physical robots, pouring billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and machine learning to speed transactions, resolve complaints and improve service. HSBC is the first to employ humanoid robots in a U.S. bank branch. \"This is going to drive more people into the door,\u201d said Pablo Sanchez, HSBC\u2019s head of retail banking and wealth management for North America. \u201cBut once they\u2019re in, it has to go beyond the gimmick. If it\u2019s just people taking selfies, in two weeks that\u2019ll be over. So we wanted to make sure it could do some really valuable things for our customers, educate them on our product set, be able to point them in the right direction.\u201d The bank, which worked with Softbank for six months to train Pepper, is tracking customers\u2019 wait times and how well the robots are helping to sell more products and services, Sanchez said. If the machines help improve users\u2019 experiences, the bank will roll them out to more of its 228 U.S. branches. Locations in California including Cupertino and Silicon Valley are next in line to get the robots. The bank plans to gradually increase Pepper\u2019s capabilities, allowing users to complete product applications on its tablet, and eventually introduce other improvements to its branches. HSBC spent $131 million on the robots and other upgrades, including voice identification and new digital banking apps. The advances come amid rising anxiety about disruption that increasingly sophisticated technology including artificial intelligence, poses to workers. Automation could wipe out a third of U.S. jobs by 2030, with the greatest impact on jobs involving repetitive tasks, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. For HSBC, staffing bank branches with machines that never take vacations or ask for a raise is not to save money but rather to drum up more business, particularly among technology-loving millennials, Sanchez said. \u201cDo I think we\u2019re going to replace all our people with Peppers?\u201d Sanchez asked. \u201cAbsolutely not. It\u2019s very much a way to grow the business and bring more humans to the party, not less.\u201d Others criticized HSBC\u2019s approach as misguided in a time when most banking happens via mobile phones, not in branches. When a customer does enter a branch, it\u2019s to speak to a person, said Neil Kinson, chief of staff at Redwood Software, a Netherlands-based firm that automates back-office operations for companies. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be putting robots on the floor,\u201d Kinson said. \u201cThey should be eliminating the jobs that noncustomer-facing people do and then moving those people onto the shop floor.\u201d Sanchez pushed back on the idea that his efforts to inject fun into a staid industry were frivolous. \u201cIn just the few tests we\u2019ve done, this thing has almost already paid for itself,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a customer come in last week and open up multiple accounts for significant dollars with us because Pepper was out there.\u201d ", "author": "Mark Von Holden | AP Images for HSBC", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/this-bank-is-staffing-branches-with-humanoid-robots-that-dance-take-s.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Mark Von Holden", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "AP Images", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "HSBC HSBC Bank", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SoftBank Robotics'", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Pepper", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fifth Ave", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Monday, June 25, 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "HSBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Manhattan", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Pepper", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "4-foot", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "HSBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "seven", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "SoftBank Robotics", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fifth Avenue", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "London", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "half-dozen", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Pepper", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Sophia The", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Robot", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "4:29 PM ET Tue", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "14", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "decades", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "J.P.

The company's stock was trading around $42 on Monday, down significantly from its 2016 highs of more than $60 a share. More reason why Goldman said he doesn't think the deal is likely to happen. Kraft, he said, would be \"taking on an awful lot of risk in doing this.\" \"If Kraft were to be interested in Campbell, we think it would be almost purely from a financial perspective,\" Goldman added. \"Campbell Soup has many issues right now.\" \"Kraft would have to use its stock, its equity for its next large deal,\" he said.

Packaged food brands continue to struggle as specialty food stores, fresh food and online retailers such as Amazon, continue to take market share. Still, Goldman told CNBC in May that \"brands are hard to kill. It may feel like right now [brands] are dying. But they're not dead yet.\" \"Kraft might want the brands,\" Goldman said Monday. And, said he Campbell is still a good company. \"The Campbell Soup brand is iconic,\" he said. \u2014 CNBC's Lauren Hirsch contributed to this report.

The company announced plans on Tuesday to spin off its health-care unit and separate its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes over the next two to three years. GE will focus its operations on the aviation, power and renewable energy businesses. \u201cToday marks an important milestone in GE\u2019s history. We are aggressively driving forward as an aviation, power and renewable energy company \u2014 three highly complementary businesses poised for future growth. We will continue to improve our operations and balance sheet as we make GE simpler and stronger,\u201d CEO John Flannery said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident that positioning GE Healthcare and BHGE outside of GE\u2019s current structure is best not only for GE and its owners, but also for these businesses, which will strengthen their market-leading positions and enhance their ability to invest for the future, while carrying the spirit of GE forward.\u201d GE said it will maintain its current quarterly dividend until it spins off its health-care unit. The company will then adjust the dividend \u201cin line with industrial peers.\u201d Flannery later said on an investor call the company will likely lower its \"aggregate\" dividend once the health-care spinoff is finished. GE shares rose 7.76 percent Tuesday, marking its best day since April 10, 2015. Its stock is down 27 percent this year through Monday and has declined by 54 percent over the past year. The company also plans to reduce its net debt by about $25 billion by 2020 and generate $500 million or more in corporate cost savings by the end of 2020. The CEO also told CNBC on Tuesday, \"We are finished\" when he was asked whether GE will be making any other restructuring moves. Moody's Investors Service reaffirmed its A2 rating and its negative outlook for GE's debt after the company's announcements. GE's \"ratings outlook remains negative as continued weakness in earnings and cash flows are expected through 2019 and into 2020,\" the ratings firm said in a release. The turnaround plan comes on the same day GE will be removed from the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, a position it has held since 1907. But GE investors may take solace in the recent history of stock price outperformance from the companies booted from the Dow. The most recent removal before General Electric soundly outperformed the S&P 500 in the year after getting booted, according to CNBC data. AT&T shares rose 15 percent in the 12 months after it was replaced by Apple in 2015 versus the S&P 500's 2 percent decline in the same time period.

GE will focus on Aviation, Power and Renewable Energy, creating a simpler, stronger, leading high-tech Industrial company. In addition to the pending combination of its Transportation business with Wabtec, GE plans to separate GE Healthcare into a standalone company, pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over the next two to three years, make its corporate structure leaner and substantially reduce debt. GE\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously approved the plans announced today. John Flannery, chairman and CEO of GE, said, \u201cToday marks an important milestone in GE\u2019s history. We are aggressively driving forward as an aviation, power and renewable energy company\u2014three highly complementary businesses poised for future growth. We will continue to improve our operations and balance sheet as we make GE simpler and stronger.\u201d Flannery continued, \u201cGE Healthcare and BHGE are excellent examples of GE at its best\u2014anticipating customer needs, breaking barriers through innovation and delivering life-changing products and services. Today\u2019s actions unlock both a pure-play healthcare company and a tier-one oil and gas servicing and equipment player. We are confident that positioning GE Healthcare and BHGE outside of GE\u2019s current structure is best not only for GE and its owners, but also for these businesses, which will strengthen their market-leading positions and enhance their ability to invest for the future, while carrying the spirit of GE forward.\u201d GE of the Future GE will be a focused high-tech industrial company that will be easier for investors to follow and measure with a significantly improved balance sheet to support its remaining businesses: GE Aviation continues to be a leader in the aviation industry. GE technology powers two out of every three commercial departures around the world and GE\u2019s global installed base includes more than 65,000 engines.GE\u2019s energy strategy, driven by GE Power and GE Renewable Energy, is based on offering a full range of energy solutions across the electricity value chain that bring affordable, reliable, efficient energy to businesses and consumers. GE powers more than one-third of the world\u2019s electricity and has a valuable installed base of approximately 7,000 gas turbines, with a track record of increasing productivity.GE will continue to invest for the future and lead in innovative technologies like additive manufacturing and digital to lead the next wave of industrial productivity. GE is making fundamental changes to how it will run the company. The new GE Operating System will result in a smaller corporate headquarters focused primarily on strategy, capital allocation, talent and governance. It will result in better execution, increased speed and is expected to generate at least $500 million in corporate savings by the end of 2020. Under the new GE Operating System, most resources and services traditionally held at the headquarters level will be realigned to the businesses. GE is targeting an Industrial net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times and a long-term A credit rating. GE also plans to reduce Industrial net debt by approximately $25 billion by 2020 and maintain more than $15 billion of cash on the balance sheet. GE expects to maintain its current quarterly dividend, subject to Board approval, until GE Healthcare is established as an independent entity. At that time, the new GE Healthcare Board of Directors will determine GE Healthcare\u2019s dividend policy, which GE expects to reflect healthcare industry practices. Also at that time, the GE Board expects to adjust the GE dividend with a target dividend policy in line with industrial peers. Creating GE Healthcare as a Standalone, Pure-Play Company Kieran Murphy, president and CEO of GE Healthcare, will continue to lead GE Healthcare as a standalone company, maintaining the GE brand. \u201cGE Healthcare\u2019s vision is to drive more individualized, precise and effective patient outcomes. As an independent global healthcare business, we will have greater flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities, react quickly to changes in the industry and invest in innovation. We will build on strong customer demand for integrated precision health solutions and great technology with digital and analytics capabilities as we enter our next chapter,\u201d said Mr. Murphy. Flannery added, \u201cGE Healthcare is an industry leader with financial strength, global scale and cutting-edge technology. Our talented Healthcare team will continue delivering precision health solutions, building on our heritage of technology innovation that delivers patient outcomes.\u201d GE Healthcare recorded over $19 billion in revenues in 2017 and posted five percent revenue growth and nine percent segment profit growth in the same year. The business provides medical imaging (including contrast agents), monitoring, biomanufacturing and cell therapy technology, leveraging deep digital, artificial intelligence and data analytics capabilities. Its products and services are valued by customers in 140 countries around the world. GE expects to generate cash from the disposition of approximately 20% of its interest in the Healthcare business and to distribute the remaining 80% to GE shareholders through a tax-free distribution. The structure, sequence and timing of these transactions will be determined and announced at a later date, but are expected to be completed over the next 12 to 18 months. GE Healthcare will conduct business as usual throughout this process, continuing to serve its partners and customers. BHGE GE plans to fully separate its 62.5% interest in BHGE in an orderly manner over the next two to three years. BHGE\u2019s full stream offering brings together equipment, services and digital solutions to help its customers be more productive\u2014a unique and powerful value proposition in a changing market. The separation will provide BHGE with enhanced agility and the ability to focus on leading in the oil and gas industry. GE Capital GE continues to work to make GE Capital smaller and more focused on supporting its core industrial businesses. The company intends to materially shrink the balance sheet of GE Capital targeting sales of $25 billion in energy and industrial finance assets by 2020. The company is assuming an approximately $3 billion capital contribution to GE Capital in 2019. In addition, the company is actively exploring options to reduce its insurance exposure. Lead Director Transition GE also announced that the Board\u2019s independent directors have completed the previously announced lead director transition, electing Larry Culp, former CEO of Danaher, to succeed Jack Brennan, who is completing his last term on the Board. The change is effective today. Mr. Culp will also chair the Board\u2019s Management Development and Compensation Committee. He joined the GE Board as an independent director earlier this year. Flannery said, \u201cAs lead director, Jack has been an incredibly valuable partner and advisor to GE through economic cycles, changes to our business and our most recent leadership transition. I would like to thank him for his advice and stewardship through a period of significant change for GE. He has been especially helpful over the last year as we have conducted our review of the company and developed our plan to position GE for the future.\u201d Flannery added, \u201cLarry\u2019s track record on strategy development and execution, capital allocation and talent make him well suited to take on this role. I appreciate his clarity, transparency and business-first philosophy, and I believe his leadership will be invaluable to GE as we enter our next chapter.\u201d Simpler, Stronger GE Today\u2019s announcements follow a series of changes GE has made in the past year. With the announced sales of Distributed Power, Industrial Solutions, and Value-Based Care, and pending combination of its Transportation business with Wabtec, GE\u2019s $20 billion divestiture target is substantially complete. Flannery concluded, \u201cGE\u2019s mission and technology change the lives of billions of people around the world. We will now move forward with purpose to make our company simpler and stronger and accelerate growth across our businesses. I\u2019m confident that today\u2019s actions, in conjunction with other changes we have already made, will produce improved operating results and increased shareholder value going forward. We are focused on executing the strategy and implementing the structure we\u2019ve laid out today to position our businesses for future growth.\u201d Conference Call and Webcast The Company has scheduled an investor conference call to discuss today\u2019s announcement. The call will begin today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the content of which is not part of this press release.

lower payout ratios in the health-care industry this will likely lead to a reduction in the aggregate GE dividend at that time,\" CEO John Flannery said on the company's investor call. On Tuesday the company announced its plan to spin off its health-care unit and separate its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes over the next two to three years. GE will focus its operations on the aviation, power and renewable energy businesses. In the announcement, the company addressed its payout, a touchy subject for the company since any change to its policy could send long-time retail holders of the blue chip headed for the exits: \"GE expects to maintain its current quarterly dividend, subject to Board approval, until GE Healthcare is established as an independent entity. At that time, the new GE Healthcare Board of Directors will determine GE Healthcare\u2019s dividend policy, which GE expects to reflect healthcare industry practices. Also at that time, the GE Board expects to adjust the GE dividend with a target dividend policy in line with industrial peers.\" GE said the spinoff is expected to be completed within 12 to 18 months. GE's current dividend yield is 3.8 percent, higher than industrial competitors Honeywell, United Technologies and Eaton at 2.07 percent, 2.25 percent and 3.48 percent, respectively. GE cut its dividend in half last November, and the stock is down 38 percent since then. That drop and its lower payout is one of the reasons why it was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, effective Tuesday. The company also plans to reduce its net debt by approximately $25 billion by 2020 and generate $500 million or more in corporate cost savings by year-end 2020.

Rasgon's new price target implies a 17.2 percent downside from Monday's close of $50.71. The stock closed at $49.67 on Tuesday. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly apparent that the structural issues we have promulgated for years are becoming ever obvious to investors,\u201d Rasgon said in a note. \u201cAnd now, we believe uncertainty around the CEO change provides an opening, limiting upside risk if numbers continue to move up for the time being, while these structural issues grow more visible.\u201d \u201cTo that end, we see 1) the leadership vacuum providing some protection from further upward revisions (with multiples coming down on the guidance raise); 2) EPS growth slowing into 2019 as compares get harder and structural issues build; and 3) an increasingly competitive environment,\u201d Rasgon said. Rasgon had upgraded Intel in April after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, but said in the note \"we have been regretting that upgrade.\" Brian Krzanich was forced out of his post as chief executive last week after an investigation into what the company called a \"consensual relationship with an Intel employee.\" Since then, Intel's stock has fallen nearly 5 percent through Monday's close.

It's hard to tell what the new dividend yield will be once the health-care business is gone. \"We will continue to improve our operations and balance sheet as we make GE simpler and stronger,\" CEO John Flannery said in the announcement. (Flannery will be on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. ET Tuesday.) The statement elaborates on how the CEO plans to do that, saying GE will reduce its net debt by $25 billion and maintain $15 billion in cash on the balance sheet. It aims for a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times for its industrial business, according to the release. GE cut its dividend in half last November, and the stock is down 38 percent since then. That drop and its lower payout is one of the reasons why it was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, effective Tuesday.

The firm raised $300 million for its first-ever fund dedicated to crypto companies, Andreessen Horowitz announced Monday. Over two to three years, it plans to put that money in everything from early-stage coins and tokens, to later-stage networks like bitcoin or ethereum, and will hold those investments for up to 10 years. Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said the firm is taking a long-term and \u201cpatient\u201d approach in the space. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market, and expect there will be many more,\u201d Dixon told CNBC Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s potential in the technology, and some of the downturns can be the best investments.\u201d He described it as an \u201call-weather\u201d fund that they plan to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions. Even if bitcoin prices dropping 50 percent this year signaled a \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d Andreessen Horowitz will keep investing aggressively, Dixon said. show chapters Bitcoin sees biggest correction in years, and Blockchain Capital Partner says there's even more pain ahead 7:30 PM ET Mon, 25 June 2018 | 06:36 \u201cThere are wild fluctuations in the price, and we see that as an opportunity,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been unphased and investing consistently over time.\u201d Dixon drew parallels to 2009 and 2010, when there was an influx of entrepreneurs and developers working on smartphone apps. Similarly he pegged crypto in 2018 as \"one of those great times to invest.\u201d Andreessen Horowitz made its first investment in the space through Coinbase in 2013, and has yet to sell any of its investments in crypto, the firm said. For this fund, investment criteria are flexible and will range across different stages, asset types and geographies, Dixon said. \u201cWe believe we are still early in the crypto movement,\u201d he said. The Menlo Park-based company is also bringing on its first-ever female general partner, former U.S. Department of Justice federal prosecutor Katie Haun, to lead the new fund. Haun helped launch the Justice Department's first government task force for crypto, and worked on the first high-profile cryptocurrency-related case, Silk Road. She is also on the board of directors of Coinbase and taught Stanford Law School\u2019s first-ever course on digital currency and cybercrime. Haun's regulatory background should be especially helpful as start-ups grapple with how their cryptocurrencies could be seen by U.S. regulators. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said earlier in June that bitcoin and ether are not securities. Still, many but not all initial coin offereings are securities and will come under the regulatory control of the SEC and relevant securities laws, he said. Clayton had made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities, and reiterated that Wednesday saying \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" While they\u2019re working with entrepreneurs on regulation, Haun said the firm's main focus is on the team of founders, since many projects are based on an underlying protocol and some projects aren't live yet. \u201cWe want to see crypto move beyond the speculation phase and see it eventually solve real-world problems for millions or even billions of people,\u201d she said.

The card company said the offering is part of a broader multi-year partnership. It is Amazon's first small business card. The deal gives Amex a big platform to woo small business customers as it aims to become a leading lender to small and mid-sized companies. Amazon also has a branded card with J. P. Morgan Chase, which issues one for consumers shopping on Amazon's site and elsewhere, and Synchrony Financial. Small business cards can be highly profitable for banks. While consumers may spend a few thousand dollars a month on credit-cards, businesses can rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills by funneling all their purchases through cards to maximize rewards points. Amex won the mandate from other banks including J. P. Morgan, which had been competing to partner on the co-branded card earlier this year, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Amazon ended up going with the leader in this space: Amex says it is the biggest card issuer for U.S. small businesses. Amazon has been looking to deepen its reach with small business owners by replicating the success it\u2019s had with household consumers. The firm has previously launched a Prime membership program for businesses and has already lent $3 billion to more than 20,000 small businesses that sell on its website, Amazon said last year. The move comes one day after the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Amex in a lawsuit over merchant fees. The high court said Amex's policy of forbidding retailers from encouraging customers to use rival cards with lower fees doesn't violate antitrust law. The decision was seen as favorable for other companies, including Amazon, that also charge merchants fees to access customers on their sites. American Express shares were slightly higher on Tuesday. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to delete the reference to Citigroup being one of the banks that had been competing to partner on the co-branded card.

He claimed that the iconic U.S. company was using increased trade tensions as an excuse to justify planned changes in manufacturing. \"A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!\" Trump said in a tweet. Tweet . Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump meets with representatives of Harley-Davidson, including CEO Matthew Levatich (R), at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 2, 2017. \"Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand,\" Trump said in another tweet. \"That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse.\" Tweet Harley did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Harley said Monday it was moving some production overseas due to increased costs from the EU's retaliatory tariffs against the Trump administration's duties on steel and aluminum. No production will be moving to Europe as a result of the tariffs, according to the company. Harley's overseas manufacturing plants are in Brazil, India, Australia and Thailand. The company announced in May 2017 it would build a plant in Thailand to better reach the southeast Asian market. CEO Matt Levatich told Bloomberg News in April he made the decision after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement with 11 other nations mostly in Asia. Producing in Thailand lets Harley avoid the country's tariff of up to 60 percent on imported motorcycles, and helps the company get tax breaks when exporting to nearby countries, according to Reuters. The company said in January it plans to grow international business to 50 percent of annual volume by 2027. Meanwhile, Harley is in the process of shutting down a Kansas City factory and transferring operations to York, Pennsylvania. The local union claims at least some of the work is moving to Thailand, while the motorcycle company has denied any link, according to media reports. Shares closed 0.6 percent lower Tuesday after falling nearly 6 percent Monday. Harley's stock is down more than 25 percent over the last 12 months. Last year, the company reported an annual decline in new motorcycle sales in both U.S. and international markets, down 8.5 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. Stifel analysts on Monday lowered their earnings estimates for this year and next by 19 cents and 45 cents per share, respectively, based on the impact from EU tariffs. They maintained a hold recommendation and a price target of $45 a share, about 8 percent above Monday's close. Trump said in a tweet Monday he was \"surprised\" by Harley's decision to move some production overseas. He publicly thanked Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson early last year for \"building things in America\" and criticized other companies for moving production outside the U.S. Trade tensions between the U.S. and the rest of the world have increased in the last several months. Harley's announcement made the company one of the first to disclose a negative impact from tit-for-tat tariffs. \"Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!\" Trump said in another tweet Tuesday.

Bernstein | Reuters Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meetings in Washington, March 21, 2018. The Federal Reserve's effort earlier this month to tamp down the rise of its benchmark interest rate already isn't running as smoothly as officials might have anticipated. At its June 12-13 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee hiked its target overnight funds rate 0.25 points to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. At the same time, it raised the interest on excess reserves 0.2 points to 1.95 percent. The move was meant to contain the rise of the funds rate, which historically trails the IOER. In the weeks running up to the meeting, the funds rate closed within 5 basis points, or 0.05 percent, of the IOER, instead of staying within the midpoint of the target range as it has done since the Fed began hiking the funds rate in December 2015. However, in the days since, the funds rate has moved even closer to the IOER. As of Friday trading, the funds rate has edged up to 1.92 percent \u2014 now just 3 basis points away from the IOER, though still 8 points away from the top of the trading range set at this month's meeting. For the Fed, it's a potential headache as the central bank sees to unwind the programs it initiated the pull the economy out of the financial crisis. The Fed kept interest rates at historically low levels and bought up nearly $4 trillion worth of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to keep rates anchored and maintain liquidity flow through the financial system. show chapters Fed\u2019s Powell: Case remains strong for continued rate increases 10:51 AM ET Wed, 20 June 2018 | 00:52 For investors, it means that continued upward pressure on the funds rate as the Fed unwinds the bonds on its balance sheet could keep the FOMC at bay in its stated intention to continue hiking interest rates. \"Here we are, and I think they will be lucky to get one more done this year, because whenever the curve flattens the market's going to look at the Fed and say, 'Really?' and the Fed will have to blink,\" said Christopher Whalen, head of Whalen Global Advisors, an investment bank consultancy. \"They're telling everyone there's going to be a couple more rate increases, and that's fanciful.\" In addition to approving the rate hike, the FOMC got more aggressive with its forecast, indicating two more increases in 2018 and at least three in 2019. However, the rise in the funds rate to near the top of its range along with a general decline in the difference between government debt yields of various maturities has raised questions about how much tighter the Fed can get. Though the committee was fairly explicit at the meetings about its intentions, and Chairman Jerome Powell last week also affirmed his belief that the Feds should keep hiking, traders in the funds market are assigning just a 45 percent chance of two more increases this year. Internally, Fed economists saw the IOER adjustment as a small technical adjustment. But the continued upward pressure could change the rate calculus, as well as the extent of the balance sheet reduction. In a program that started in October 2017, the central bank is allowing a capped level of proceeds from its bond holdings to run off each month and is reinvesting the rest. Whalen thinks the Fed has made a \"fundamental screw-up\" in the process by focusing solely on short-term reverse repo operations to control rates when yields are compressing across the duration curve. The New York Fed, which runs the central bank's trading operations, declined a request for comment. \"Jay Powell should be managing the yield curve,\" Whalen said, using the chairman's nickname. \"He should make sure the curve remains positive, which means he can't just wait for the portfolio to run off. He's got to be willing to sell the long end of the market. It wouldn't have a huge impact, but it would at least keep the curve positive.\" What's next Taking substantial action at this point, though, would send what could be a negative message to the market \u2014 that the balance sheet runoff, which former Chair Janet Yellen said would be \"like watching paint dry,\" is running into snags and requires corrective action. However, the Fed would have no choice if there are indications that it can't control the market movements, particularly considering the record level of Treasury debt the government has issued this year. \"This is exposing how tenuous that process is and the great unknown of what's going to happen,\" said Danielle DiMartino Booth, founder of economic consulting firm Money Strong and a former advisor to former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher for nine years, including during the financial crisis. \"These are plumbing issues that are coming back to haunt the Fed.\" The flood of debt issuance combined with rate hikes and the balance sheet runoff is creating a tightening in financial conditions that the Fed may not have anticipated. While Powell and others have touted the strength of the economy as justification for raising rates, the yield curve compression is signaling to some market participants that a slowdown may not be that far in the distance. An inverted yield curve, in which longer-term yields are lower than short-term, indicate that markets believe growth will be slower in the future. \"There are a lot of things going on right now, none of which are favorable for the Fed trying to create a perception that they've got everything under control,\" DiMartino Booth said. Other issues also are at play in terms of the funds rate closing in on the IOER level. Smaller banks \"have been much more aggressive\" in expanding lending than large banks, causing them to have to borrow from bigger institutions. That is creating most of the demand in the short-term funds market as big banks already have nearly $2 trillion in reserves at the Fed. That in turn is driving the funds rate higher, said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. Blitz said there remains some confusion about how high the level of reserves needs to be at the Fed, creating uncertainty about how far the Fed should go in tightening. As for the effort to keep the funds rate in check, \"it doesn't seem to be working,\" he added. Whalen suggested the Fed should revisit a process known as \"Operation Twist\" that it conducted amid the bond buying. The Fed in that instance bought long-term holdings and sold an approximately equal amount of shorter-term Treasurys in an order to drive down rates farther out on the curve. Whalen said the Fed should reverse that process this time to keep shorter-term rates low, without expanding the size of its balance sheet. Whether the Fed would be willing to do such an about-face at this stage, though, is in doubt. \"You're talking about a massive reversal of position,\" DiMartino Booth said. \"I think that would send a very bad signal for markets.\" Correction: An earlier version misstated how Operation Twist worked.

That\u2019s because they are \u201ctoo crazy,\u201d said Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cThey are generating so much anger around the world. It\u2019s not a sustainable policy,\u201d he said on \u201cPower Lunch\" Trade tensions have been escalating between the U.S. and the rest of the world. On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump plans to bar several Chinese companies from making investments in American technology. Meanwhile, last week, a flurry of back-and-forth tariff threats continued between the U.S. and China, as well as between the U.S. and the European Union. His latest tariff announcement against China came earlier in the week when he asked the U.S. trade representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese imports for tariffs. His most recent target for the EU is autos, announcing the U.S. would impose tariffs on car imports if the EU didn\u2019t remove duties on American cars. Todd Buchholz, former White House economic advisor under President George H.W. Bush, believes timing is key for the Trump administration. He told \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Monday that the White House is probably thinking \u201cif you can\u2019t take on China now \u2014 when the economy is growing at 4 percent, when unemployment is nearly at record lows \u2014 when will you have the wherewithal to do that?\u201d \u201cDoes it take a toll on the economy? Yes. Does it take a toll on the market? Yes,\u201d he added. However, Trump is someone who made his name in real estate and reality TV programming, said Buchholz, now CEO of educational start-up Sproglit. \u201cHe knows a lot about game theory and this is a game he\u2019s playing.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 496 points, while the S&P 500 fell 2 percent before both regained some ground. The Dow ultimately closed more than 300 points lower after Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro told \u201cClosing Bell\u201d there are no plans to restrict foreign investment as part of the administration's trade actions against China or other countries. Chris Hill, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, South Korea, Poland and Macedonia, said while getting tough on China is overdue, the White House has failed to put together a game plan. \u201cThey just go out there slugging away,\u201d he said on \u201cClosing Bell,\u201d adding it becomes question of who is going to say things last and then bracing for the \u201cTwitter storm\u201d from Trump to follow. \u201cThe whole thing adds up to a view that somehow they don\u2019t have their act together and that\u2019s what\u2019s making people very nervous,\u201d said Hill, also former assistant secretary of State during President George W.

Bitcoin, which fell below $6,000 on Friday for the first time since February, reached an all time high of around $19,500 last December. That's a decline of nearly 70 percent.

But he pointed out that the price for bitcoin is \"pretty good right now\" if investors are thinking short term.

Initial public offerings are a dying breed, a phenomenon that has attracted recent attention, especially given the fire hose of emerging tech-related start-ups, The real losers are ordinary investors. For decades, individuals have participated in the fastest growth segments of the economy by making stock investments through their pension plans, 401(k) accounts and mutual funds. The underlying owners of the majority of these assets are households and individuals. Once upon a time, high-growth tech companies sought capital by offering ownership to the public rather than to a select group of elite private investors, and this lifted the fortunes of regular people. I know this first hand. My mother, a social worker, contributed monthly to her retirement account, which was mostly invested in Fidelity\u2019s Magellan Fund. That was no accident. When she was first allowed a choice, I was working for Peter Lynch, who managed Magellan. When she died, almost 20 years ago, the assets in her account had growth extraordinarily, thanks in large part to many stellar stocks that we bought as IPOs or small-caps. Consider that between 1995 and 1999, there were a total of 768 tech IPO\u2019s, an average of 153 per year, including household names like Amazon, eBay and Yahoo. By contrast, during the most recent five-year time period, there have been a total of 106 technology IPOs, an average of only 21 a year. Until a decade ago, the goal of a successful tech start-up was to go public, which would raise additional funds for expansion and allow the founders and early investors to recoup some of their, money hopefully at a nice profit. Today\u2019s new companies don\u2019t need or even want the public\u2019s money. Before rolling out of bed, a start-up CEO may find a line outside his or her door of willing private investors with very deep pockets. There is so much available capital from venture capital, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, enormously rich angel investors and tech behemoths like Alphabet, Facebook and Apple, that even juvenile firms with substantial burn rates can avoid the arduous process of a filing, road show, pricing, and the agony or ecstasy of spending innumerable hours with Wall Street bankers. As shown in the chart below, venture capital funds alone raised over $84 billion in 2017, far above the levels gathered in the last peak, prior to the recession. With young companies staying private, accompanied by the natural attrition from mergers and acquisitions, the number of public companies has shrunk over the past decade. In 1996, there were 7,322 companies listed on the NYSE, and today there are only 3,671. The average age of listed companies has risen 50 percent in 20 years, from 12 to 18 years old. How has this erosion affected millions of U.S. investors? Reviewing the composition of the Technology SPDR ETF (XLK) over time reveals that 64 percent of the current 72 holdings, representing the largest tech stocks in the sector, were not in the index 20 years ago.That means they were either too small in 1998 or not yet public.The total return of this ETF over the past 10 years is 247 percent, far exceeding the S&P 500's gain of 154 percent. Therefore, one can infer that the inclusion of fast growing innovators, such as Facebook, Alphabet, or Salesforce.com has factored meaningfully into that superior return. The next table compares the 20-year performance of the Russell 2000, an index heavily weighted toward smaller market caps, to the S&P 500, which it handily beats. Source: FactSet Some argue that if young, innovative firms are acquired by the large platform giants, such as Facebook, Google, or Apple, the public would continue to benefit by owning the parent stock. However, the impact of a small add-on acquisition to a stock valued at hundreds of billions of dollars is, by definition, less powerful than if that company remained independent, at least for several more years. If the average American suffers from the lack of IPOs, how can we correct this problem? One suggestion is easier access or lower minimums for venture capital and private equity funds, but illiquidity and complex fund structures complicate this option. Policy makers should focus on simplifying the public filing regulatory hurdles. It\u2019s very possible that the real catalyst will be the unraveling of not only the once-high flying biotech startup Theranos but several other very high profile private companies with private valuations of over $10 billion. Would the same, possibly fraudulent, behavior have occurred at Theranos if it were public? Maybe, but it's less likely.

Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won\u2019t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!\" he added. Tweet Early last year, Trump publicly thanked Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson for \"building things in America\" and criticized other companies for moving production outside the U.S. Harley said Monday that new EU tariffs implemented Friday would increase the average cost per motorcycle by about $2,200 and the company will shift some production overseas as a result. The European Union imposed the tariffs in retaliation against the Trump administration's duties on steel and aluminum imports, which were an effort by Trump to protect U.S. jobs. No production will be moving to Europe as a result of the tariffs, according to the company. Harley's overseas manufacturing plants are in Brazil, India, Australia and Thailand. In the U.S., the company is shutting down a Kansas City factory and transferring operations to York, Pennsylvania. Trump tweeted Monday and Tuesday that Harley was using the tariffs as an excuse to justify existing plans. He also said the iconic U.S. motorcycle company would be \"taxed like never before\" if it moved operations overseas. Also on Wednesday, S&P Global Ratings said EU tariffs will add so much to Harley-Davidson's existing challenges it is putting the company's credit rating on negative watch. \"The CreditWatch placement reflects our belief that near-term cost increases due to retaliatory tariffs recently imposed by the EU, combined with other significant headwinds, could cause margin deterioration and increase business risks over the next several years,\" Primary Credit Analyst Daniel Pianki said Wednesday in a report. \"We could lower our rating on Harley as a result.\" As of Wednesday, S&P had an \"A-\" corporate credit rating on Harley, toward the lower end of investment grade. The motorcycle company did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. \"The CreditWatch placement follows our outlook revision to negative in January 2018 due to persistent sales declines, elevated marketing costs, and our expectation that EBITDA margin would decline over the next two years while Harley consolidates some assembly plants to achieve longer-term cost savings,\" S&P's Pianki said. Shares of the motorcycle company closed 0.8 percent higher Wednesday after the Trump tweet and S&P announcement. The stock has dropped about 5.8 percent this week, for a decline of more than 20 percent over the last 12 months. In the first quarter, Harley reported a 12 percent decline in U.S. motorcycle sales, and a 0.2 percent increase in international sales. Last year, the company reported an annual decline in new motorcycle sales in both U.S. and international markets, down 8.5 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. S&P said it will resolve the CreditWatch after Harley's second-quarter results, due July 24. \"Persistent new-motorcycle sales declines during periods of GDP growth and a relatively healthy economy could reflect unfavorable longer-term trends in the motorcycle industry,\" the S&P report said. \"Sales of other high-ticket discretionary leisure products (e.g., recreational vehicles and timeshares) have grown substantially over the same period.\" ", "author": "Georg Wendt | picture alliance | Getty Images", "link":

The upward climb in the stock price is a welcome reprieve for company management. GE shares are down 21 percent in 2018 and down nearly 50 percent over the past year as the company has attempted to focus on a small number of core segments.

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Billionaire investor Warren Buffett was way ahead of a loud and growing chorus of bitcoin haters, and began questioning its viability five years ago. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO made headlines this year for calling bitcoin \u201crat poison squared\u201d but he first took on the digital currency at the company\u2019s 2013 annual shareholder meeting, according to a review of CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive. \u201cOf our $49 billion, we haven\u2019t moved any to bitcoin,\u201d Buffett said at the time, when the digital currency was trading near $130. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett's long-time business partner, had kicked off the discussion that Saturday saying he had \u201cno confidence whatsoever\u201d in bitcoin becoming a universal currency. Buffett agreed, saying that was his \u201cgut reaction.\u201d Buffett, whose net-worth is more than $80 billion, stepped up his criticism a year later and said it was neither a durable means of exchange nor a store of value. \u201cI would not be surprised if it\u2019s not around in 10 or 20 years,\u201d Buffett told CNBC at the 2014 annual shareholder meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not a currency, it does not meet the test of a currency.\u201d He called bitcoin a speculative kind of \u201cBuck Rogers\" phenomenon, and said people buy and sell them thinking they\u2019ll go up or down, \u201cjust like they did with tulip bulbs.\u201d Buffett and Munger have invested in everything from Coca-Cola to Heinz ketchup to IBM computers to Dairy Queen and Duracell. The two have also backed insurance companies, media companies, railroads and real estate. Days after the 2014 shareholder meeting, Buffett appeared on Squawk Box, and called bitcoin a \u201cmirage.\u201d \u201cStay away from it. It\u2019s a mirage, basically,\" he said. \"The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.\u201d Buffett joins business leaders Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates, economists Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller, and the fund managers Ray Dalio and Howard Marks among those who have questioned its legitimacy. Four years after Buffett's first public comments, bitcoin rallied to nearly $20,000 and gained more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Weeks after it hit its high, Buffett said he was still staying away. \u201cIn terms of cryptocurrencies, I can say almost with certainty they will come to a bad ending,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWhen it happens or how I don\u2019t know.\u201d Since Buffett first addressed bitcoin, its price has jumped more than 4,000 percent. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-QYtFK\"),window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"QYtFK\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"QYtFK\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); But more recently, the digital currency has nosedived 70 percent from its high and is down roughly 50 percent this year, trading near $6,100 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk.

Amazon could finally be getting around to launching its small business lending program in China, putting it on a collision course with home-grown juggernaut Alibaba. The company is seeking a manager \u201cwith end-to-end responsibility for scaling operations and partner programs in a new strategic initiative in China\u201d for its lending arm, according to a June 19 job listing. China is by far the biggest e-commerce market in the world, making it a battleground for companies racing to establish global empires. Chinese consumers spent $1.1 trillion on online retail channels last year, 32 percent more than 2016 and more than double the U.S. figure. Seattle-based Amazon has found the Chinese market hard to crack, mostly because of competition from online retailers Alibaba and JD.com. Despite more than a decade there, Amazon has less than 2 percent of the market, according to iResearch. So the lending program could be a way for Amazon to turn the tide by encouraging merchants to use its platform. Amazon began extending credit to small business owners in 2011, using sales data to trigger invitations for financing that could fuel growth. The company\u2019s race to lock up sellers in China gained urgency last week after Google said it plans to invest $550 million in JD.com as part of a strategic partnership. While Amazon announced plans to expand the lending program to China and seven other countries back in 2015, a press release two years later said it had only issued loans in the U.S., Japan and the U.K. By then, Amazon had made more than $3 billion in short-term loans ranging in size from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon has a voracious appetite for talent in China. It has 476 listings for jobs there, from sales to software and hardware development. Applicants for the new lending position should be fluent in English and Mandarin and have a background in consumer credit or small business finance. An Amazon spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

North Korea could account for up to 24 percent of the Korean Peninsula's total gross domestic product in 20 years under reunification with the South, UBS estimated in a report this week. The rogue state currently accounts for 1.1 percent of the regional economy. Tensions around the nuclear state have eased after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un met with the leaders of South Korea and U.S. While it's far from clear whether the two halves of the peninsula will ever reunify, they may be closer to establishing two peaceful, independent states, which by UBS' analysis would also help growth. A peace treaty formally ending the Korean War and opening the North-South border would increase foreign investment, helping the economy, UBS economist Li Zeng and analyst Yong-Suk Son said in a Tuesday report. North Korea could also then utilize its natural resources and well-educated labor force, the analysts said, noting compulsory secondary education. In 2016, nearly half of economic growth came from the industrial sector, just under a third from services, and about a fifth from agriculture, the UBS report said. North Korea's natural resources worth about $4 trillion Source: North Korea Resources Institute, Thomson Reuters, UBS. Prices as of May 31, 2018. \"The current market value of North Korea's known reserves of natural resources is estimated at close to USD4 trillion,\" the analysts said. \"It's about 225 times of North Korea's current GDP (USD17.6 bil in 2017). If well utilized (not fall under the so-called 'resource curse'), these natural resources could provide much needed support to boost North Korea's economic growth.\" North Korea remains tiny and backward. Its centralized economy is the only one whose income level has fallen over the past 30 years, for a GDP of under $17 billion versus Vietnam's $205.3 billion in 2016, according to UBS. Survival is highly dependent on China, and sanctions to counter North Korea's nuclear threat have put further pressure on the economy. Nearly 40 percent of North Korea's 25.5 million people live in poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock. In the creation of two peaceful, independent states, North Korea's per capita GDP could multiply at least 8.3 times in 20 years, with an implied annual growth rate of 11.2 percent to 17.4 percent, the UBS report said. Reunification would send that implied annual growth rate to 20.6 percent. \"Is it possible at all for North Korea to deliver such an astonishing growth performance?\" the UBS analysts said. \"It will be very challenging; but taking all the favorable conditions discussed above into consideration, we don't think it's necessarily impossible, although achieving it will likely require much more than just North Korea's own efforts.\" The analysts assume South Korea would contribute much of the initial foreign investment, and incur cumulative costs of 10.4 percent of GDP in a two-state result, and 31 percent of GDP under reunification. Overall, that would take North Korea's share of the peninsula's GDP from 1.1 percent to 15.2 percent or 23.5 percent in two decades, respectively. The UBS analysis counts 20 years from the beginning of any possible normalization of North Korean economic relations with the rest of the world \u2014 a highly uncertain outcome. Satellite images indicate North Korea is upgrading a nuclear research facility, according to a report Tuesday from analysis website 38 North. The visible additions come despite dictator Kim Jong Un's commitment to complete denuclearization at a historic summit with President Donald Trump earlier this month. The report did note the construction at the facility should not be linked to the denuclearization pledge, and that no change to the status quo is expected unless Pyongyang issues specific orders.

Fox owns 39 percent of Sky, which Disney CEO Bob Iger has called a \"crown jewel\" among Fox's assets. But when Disney decided last week to increase its offer for Fox to $71.3 billion ($38 a share), topping Comcast's bid, Fox did not raise its corresponding bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn't already own. While Fox is a much bigger name in the U.S., Sky isn't small potatoes \u2014 it could be worth more than $65 billion itself. That's a huge company to hang in the balance as a potential bargaining chip in the larger fight for Fox. People close to Sky are unsure about how Disney sees its future should Iger end up victorious in buying Fox, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because its internal discussions were private. Fox and Disney are working together to decide if Fox will again bid for Sky. Fox doesn't have to bump its bid yet, and Sky isn't ready to put either bid to a shareholder vote. But several people close to Sky thought an increased bid would come at the same time Disney bumped its bid for Fox. It could be that Disney is signaling to Comcast that it's willing to let Sky go if Comcast will give up on Fox, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research. Disney and Comcast can't directly communicate about splitting any of the Fox assets unless Fox releases Disney from its already-signed merger agreement. \"If Disney doesn't bid again on Sky, perhaps Comcast lets them take Fox for $38 a share, and Comcast walks away with Sky, and you don't force each side to overpay massively,\" said Chaplin. \"They could save each other a lot of hassle.\" Fox said in a regulatory filing that it \"remains committed to the Sky acquisition and is currently considering its options. Completion of the Sky acquisition is not a condition to either party\u2019s obligation to consummate the transactions.\" Fox and Disney spokespeople declined to comment. A Sky spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Why Disney would want Sky Sky has been in play for a long time. In December 2016, Fox made its initial bid for all of Sky, but that was held up by U.K. regulators on concern that Fox's Rupert Murdoch would have too much control over British television and newspapers. Comcast topped Fox's bid in April, offering $31 billion for the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn't own, causing independent directors at Sky to withdraw their support of the Fox deal. That remains the current state of bidding for Sky. show chapters Cramer: The market is saying there's no real loser in Disney and Comcast's battle for Fox assets 6:39 PM ET Wed, 20 June 2018 | 11:31 In the battle for Fox, Disney and Comcast haven't shown any signs that they're willing to go easy on each other. Nor has Disney suggested it would be willing to cede Sky to Comcast. At the same time, Iger has not yet said that Fox/Disney will top Comcast's latest offer. He declined to elaborate on his company's plans for Sky in a conference call last week. \"We don't have an update on Sky,\" Iger said on June 20. \"Fox is in the driver's seat regarding the 61 percent that they do not control.\" Disney \"loves the asset\" and still really wants it, according to a person familiar with Disney's thinking. Although Sky is primarily a service provider, selling TV, internet and phone service to retail customers, it also owns content, including the rights to Premier League soccer. This fits nicely with Disney's ESPN. Sky also owns an over-the-top distribution service, and Disney plans to launch its own OTT product next year. \"Sky is just an amazing platform,\" Iger said in a December interview with Bloomberg TV. \"Not only does it provide consumers with a great consumer experience in terms of access to the programming, but also creates a lot of great programming, from sports, to news, to all forms of entertainment. We\u2019ve actually distributed a lot of our programming on Sky, we\u2019re extremely impressed with their user interface, their ability to attract and retain consumers, the value proposition to their consumers.\" Moreover, Fox seems to be favoring a Disney deal because it believes a Comcast buy would create \"higher regulatory risk leading to the possibility of significant delay,\" the company said in a filing on Tuesday. Why Comcast might make more sense At the same time, there are obvious benefits for Disney if it sits out. Dropping a pursuit of Sky would lower Disney\u2019s debt burden and potentially please its shareholders. (Disney says it would have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times with Sky and 3.4 times without.) Lowering this debt burden could raise Disney's share price. This in turn would be good for Fox, because it would raise the value of the half cash-half stock offer. Iger would still get Fox's movie and TV studio, cable channels FX and Nat Geo, and stakes in Star India and Hulu \u2014 as well as the 31 percent of Sky that Fox already owns. (Although there's some question whether Disney would hold on to that portion if the rest goes to Comcast.) Comcast, meanwhile, is still weighing its counteroffer options to Disney's increased bid. From a core business standpoint, Comcast is a more logical buyer for Sky than Disney. Sky, like Comcast, sells TV, Internet and phone service to retail customers. The company has about 23 million retail customers throughout Europe. Comcast is intimately familiar with the distribution business, while Disney has never run a pay-TV operator or distributor of Internet and phone service. If Comcast were to end up with 61 percent of Sky, and Disney were to buy the bundle of Fox assets, Disney might not want to keep its minority 39 percent. Disney would probably sell the minority stake to Comcast, although there may be some strategic value in keeping it, Chaplin said. Still, the most likely scenario may be that Comcast loses Fox to Disney but wins Sky in a bidding war, and everyone overpays for everything, Chaplin said. \"I still think Comcast will push Fox to the max and lose,\" Chaplin said. \"Then, with $100 billion in its war chest, if Comcast really wants Sky, it can get it. For Comcast, Sky gets them the most strategically, while Disney has to have the movie studio and Star India. This would be the closest opportunity for detente.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com, and is a co-owner of Hulu.

The Bank of England (BOE) has attacked the European Union (EU) for risking the possibility that \u00a329 trillion ($38 trillion) worth of derivatives could becoming untradeable after March next year. In its Financial Stability Report, published Wednesday, the U.K. central bank said that while the British government had committed to a temporary permissions regime from March 2019 onwards, the EU had, as yet, made no corresponding promise. Britain is set to leave the bloc on March 29, 2019. The BOE said the biggest Brexit risk to financial services remained where both the EU and U.K. needed to act, such as ensuring the continuity of existing derivatives. In the report, the bank said that the EU had not \u201cindicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime.\u201d The bank estimated that this could affect about a quarter of over-the-counter derivative contracts between the U.K. and the European Economic Area (EEA), with a notional value of around \u00a329 trillion. Of that amount, around \u00a316 trillion is due to mature after Britain leaves the EU. A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an underlying financial asset like stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies or interest rates. \"The U.K. government has committed to legislate, if necessary, to allow EEA counterparties to continue servicing contracts with U.K. entities (through a temporary permissions regime and additional legislation if required),\" the report said. \"EU authorities have not announced an intention to enable U.K. counterparties to continue servicing contracts with counterparties in the EEA.\u201d show chapters Why is Trump good for the EU? 5:06 AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 | 04:02 The BOE accusation could be seen as a response to EU criticism last week that claimed U.K. banks were not prepared for a hard Brexit.

A good portion of the companies promising to do life-changing things on the internet quickly went bust, Wozniak reminded the audience. Still, he said blockchain technology has real implementation potential, because it\u2019s \u201cdecentralized and totally trustworthy.\u201d But like the internet, it could take longer than expected to catch up to its early hype. \u201cIf you look now you say all that internet stuff happened, we got it, it just took a while,\u201d Wozniak said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change in a day, a lot of the blockchain ideas that are really good by coming out early they can burn themselves out by not being prepared to be stable in the long run.\u201d Bitcoin was the first use for blockchain, but the technology has been applied to countless other applications since. It records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates tout as faster and more secure and say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases. Wozniak highlighted Ethereum as having potential to outlive the hype because of its use case, and ability for programmers to build their own related projects. Ethereum is the name of the foundation that created the digital token ether, which was first launched as a fundraising effort to develop the platform. Companies like Microsoft and J.P. Morgan, are developing uses for the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin, which Wozniak has called digital gold, despite being down more than 50 percent this year, is still \"just amazing,\" he said. Wozniak founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and was behind the launch of the company's first personal computers. He sold all but one bitcoin last year when the digital asset was soaring to a high near $20,000 after originally buying the cryptocurrency so he could one day travel without carrying cash or credit cards. \u201cAll of the sudden it was way down, then way up in the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cI got scared, and sold everything but one bitcoin.\u201d Wozniak also floated the idea of using blockchain for social networks, and a competitor to Facebook, which he said is ripe for disruption and operating a monopoly at the moment.

Disney raised its bid for pieces of Twenty-First Century Fox to $71.3 billion, up from its original offer of $52.5 billion. This was in response to Comcast\u2019s offer of $65 billion for the same Fox assets. Disney\u2019s original bid was all stock. Its new bid is a mix of stock and cash, which raises Murdoch\u2019s tax bill and cuts into his ultimate payday. The higher-priced Disney bid could yield about $2 billion less for Murdoch than Disney's original offer in December, despite the new offer being almost $20 billion higher. That's assuming Murdoch takes part of his payment in cash, as the new deal is structured. Murdoch owns about 17 percent of Fox. Disney's original offer would have amounted to a tax-free payday of $8.84 billion, plus another $8.29 billion from the tax-free spin off of the new Fox. That would have given him a total of $17.13 billion. Disney's new offer amounts to $12.12 billion for Murdoch, based on his 17 percent stake. But some of that is taxable, and if he takes the full half in cash, he ends up with $9.94 billion after tax. And then with the taxable spin off of the new Fox, around $5.3 billion, his proceeds from the overall deal would be $15.24 billion, nearly $2 billion less. And then there's Comcast's offer, which also would fall short of Disney's original bid. It would net Murdoch $7.07 billion after taxes, plus another $5.3 billion from the spin off, for a total of $12.37 billion. If Comcast wants to get Murdoch back to the same levels he was at with the original Disney offer, the all-cash bid needs to be about $81 billion, which would be $16 billion higher than it is now, and nearly $30 billion higher than Disney\u2019s original offer. Regardless of what offer Murdoch takes, he\u2019s still going to earn enough money to cover himself and his family for many, many lifetimes. So, part of this is just quibbling at the edges. But for a man who built an empire, and runs a conservative news network, he\u2019s unlikely to enjoy watching billions go to the government. For Murdoch, his tax bill can\u2019t be a consideration in what deal Fox ultimately takes. He has to get the best price for his shareholders, otherwise he can expect lawsuits. \"I'm not surprised to see that the original offer is much better for him on an after-tax basis, which is the only basis that matters,\" said Robert Willens of Robert Willens LLC and a noted tax advisor to the wealthy. Disney and Comcast, the parent of CNBC, have battled in private over the Fox assets for months. Murdoch was said to like Disney's original offer because of its tax-free treatment. In a statement with Disney's sweetened offer, Murdoch said they \"firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry.\" As CNBC has already reported, Comcast's all-cash deal could result in a tax bill for Murdoch of $4 billion to $7 billion. Murdoch's potential tax bill calculation uses a number of assumptions. For starters, his tax planning and personal financial strategies are unknown, but it is assumed his holdings of Fox \u2014 approximately 319 million shares, according to the most recent annual proxy \u2014 are at a zero or near-zero cost. That means he would be subject to a sizable capital gain. It's also assumed Murdoch would be subject to New York state and city tax. Disney's new bid is $38 a share, or $19 in cash. The calculations assume he accepts the full 50 percent in cash, and the tax would be $6.85 a share, or $2.18 billion, based on his holdings. Of course, he may try to take it all in stock, instead. The deal gives shareholders the right to opt that way, but since Disney is aiming to pay half in stock and half in cash, overall, it's most likely shareholders will be prorated. \"I think, at the end of the day, given Disney's desire to pay half cash and half stock for Fox in the aggregate, Mr. Murdoch will wind up receiving roughly those percentages of his consideration in those forms,\" Willens said. Then, there is the spin off of the remainder of Fox not being sold to Disney, something that would also trigger taxes because of the cash component of the offer, Willens said. Assuming the spinoff is about $26 a share and Murdoch paid 36 percent in federal, state and local New York taxes on it, that would be a tax bill of $2.98 billion. The two bills together: $5.12 billion. But then again, Comcast could always bid more and bring everyone back to the drawing board. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC.

Homes are being inundated with mail solicitations from companies like Marcus, Elevate and Lending Club, hoping to supply personal loans to consumers. In all, 10 nonbank lenders that Credit Suisse tracks sent out 368 million pieces during May, a volume increase of 10 percent over April and a jump of 41 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Credit Suisse, which tracks the somewhat off-the-grid indicator. Personal loan debt is at $120 billion through the first quarter of 2018, an 18 percent surge from last year. \"We believe mail volume data is an important barometer of competitiveness, particularly in personal lending space where direct mail volume has seen an increasing trend over the past few years,\" Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said in a research note. \"In general, we believe that going forward, personal loan lenders will continue to utilize the direct mail channel as the major customer acquisition source.\" Marcus, a Goldman Sachs enterprise that focuses on prime borrowers, sent the most solicitations in May of the companies analyzed. The lender's 49 million pieces marked a 225 percent rise over the May 2017 and a 39 increase from April 2018. Personal loans often are utilized for debt consolidation, though they can be put to a multitude of uses. \"For us, one of the key insights is based on some research that we did: 77 percent of consumers with high-interest credit card debt are unaware that you can use a personal loan to pay off that credit card debt,\" said Dustin Cohn, head of brand management and marketing communications for Marcus. \"Our objective has been to create awareness.\" show chapters Credit card negotiation 6:10 PM ET Tue, 19 June 2018 | 01:23 Another leader in the group, Elevate, saw a 74 percent monthly increase and a 109 percent jump in year-over-year mail volume where it sent out more than 20 million pieces in May. A company spokesman cautioned that the data may not be totally accurate, but said the rise in its case was due to seasonality coinciding with tax season and is consistent with the company's 20 percent annualized revenue growth. American consumers have $1.03 trillion in revolving credit, a 20 percent increase over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data. Typical credit card interest rates average 15.3 percent, a level that has jumped since the Fed started hiking rates in 2015. High interest cards can run nearly double that. The average personal loan rate is 10.22 percent, providing considerable savings for consumers who hold the high-rate cards. \"For us, this is about better debt management,\" Cohn said. For others in the industry, though, the effort may be about pure volume \u2014 trying to generate as much business as possible as compressing margins hit profitability. On the other side, consumers are feeling more confident and willing to spend but many lack the cash on hand, said Mike Chadwick, head of Chadwick Financial Advisors.

According to Gregg Lemkau, co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, the value of NFL teams has been stable but MLS teams are on the rise. \"The growth of soccer in the U.S. has actually been quite positive,\" Lemkau said on \"Closing Bell.\" With the U.S. hosting the World Cup in 2026, Lemkau said the popularity of soccer will continue to expand. The average attendance per game has recently surpassed that of the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association, he added. When it comes to investments, the NFL is one of the most expensive to make. The league has 32 franchises valued at about $2 billion each, according to Lemkau. An MLS team might sell for $500 million now; however, in the long run, its value might catch up with that of the NFL, he said. There are 23 MLS teams. And it's not just soccer. The NBA also may eventually be more valuable than the NFL, with live sports assets remaining highly profitable, said Lemkau.

The announcement exacerbates concerns about a shortage of oil at a time when Venezuela's production is in terminal decline and the market is grappling with short-term supply disruptions from Canada and Libya. Last week, OPEC and other producers including Russia agreed to raise output to prevent price spikes. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Tuesday's session up $2.45 a barrel, or 3.6 percent, to $70.53, erasing earlier losses and breaking above $70 for the first time since May 25. International benchmark Brent crude was up $1.60, or 2.1 percent, at $76.33 per barrel by 2:29 pm. ET. Oil prices rose further in late electronic trading, after API data showed a large decline in oil inventories of 9.2 million barrels in the latest week. Government supply data is expected Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET. \u201cThe U.S. is continuing its decision to completely isolate Iran,\" said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy. \u201cThey\u2019re ringing the bell even louder.\" WTI intraday chart President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and restored wide-ranging sanctions against the Middle Eastern country in May, but the administration did not set a timeline for completely cutting Iranian crude imports. Market-watchers questioned whether Trump would follow former President Barack Obama's model, which called on foreign companies to reduce their purchases by 20 percent every 180 days. But the State Department clarified on Tuesday that Trump expects buyers to entirely wind down those purchases by Nov. 4. \"This isn\u2019t unexpected. These people seem strident in what they want to do,\" said McGillian. \"What the effect is going to be is going to be the difficult thing to measure. It could point to more demand for U.S. oil.\" Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, exports more than 2 million barrels per day. John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital, said Trump's decision appears calibrated to crush the Iranian regime, which has endured despite nearly 40 years of U.S. pressure. \"I\u2019m seeing the companies \u2014 left, right and center \u2014 drop out from buying\u201d Iranian oil, Kilduff said. \"Total and Shell have announced they\u2019re not buying it anymore, starting now.\" show chapters Brent trying to balance around $75 mark, says oil expert 6:32 AM ET Tue, 26 June 2018 | 02:35 Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told CNBC last week that no major multinational oil and gas company can take the risk of running afoul of U.S. sanctions by doing business in Iran. Earlier in the day, oil prices pulled back sharply following a report that Saudi Arabia aims to increase its output to record levels next month. Following an agreement among oil producers to ease output caps that have been in place for 18 months, the Saudis intend to hike production from about 10 million barrels per day to 10.8 million bpd in July, Bloomberg News reported. OPEC has faced pressure from big oil consumers such as India and China to tamp down oil prices after they recently rose to new 3\u00bd-year highs. Trump also called on OPEC to add more supply, as he faces the prospect of Americans holding him accountable for gasoline prices hovering near $3 a gallon. Oil prices also got support on Tuesday from an outage at Canada's largest oil sands facility and concerns about Libya's crude exports due to developments in that country's ongoing conflict. The commander of Libya's eastern political faction has transferred control of oil ports to a national company aligned with his faction, cutting off access to the supplies from the official oil authority in Tripoli, Reuters reported.

Inc., at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Thursday, July 7, 2011. Tech giant Amazon buying a media company to expand its video content could be the best way to compete with Netflix, and of its options, CBS could be the best fit, research shop MoffettNathanson speculated Tuesday. \"Rather than build it out over time, we wonder if Amazon would embrace a \u2018buy it\u2019 model and seek to acquire a traditional media company with content creation skills, deep proprietary content libraries, sports production capabilities, and burgeoning OTT ambitions,\u201d Senior Research Analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to clients. \u201cOf all the companies available, CBS is the most logical fit.\u201d Amazon Prime Video, whose core streamer is 18 to 34 year olds, is lagging behind Netflix in usage and reach and according to Nathanson, lacks the deep content library needed to compete. A traditional path to dethroning competitors could take a while if Amazon relies on building, marketing, and producing its own pipeline of shows, he said. CBS\u2019s future though is tied up until an October 3 court date, when the battle for control of the company between Shari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, and CBS CEO Les Moonves could come to a head. \u201cIf CBS is given their freedom from NAI\u2019s control (which we doubt), we believe that an M&A premium would quickly emerge,\u201d he said. In any event, Nathanson said Amazon will be patient and look at what price they could pay, comparing it to the Whole Foods acquisition last summer. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t need to be Disney or FOX, just like the move into grocery wasn\u2019t Walmart or Kroger,\u201d Nathanson said. Shares of CBS have dropped about 13 percent in the past year, while Amazon's stock is up roughly 70 percent. CBS has a current market cap of around $21 billion based on Tuesday's $55 share price, and this would be Amazon\u2019s largest acquisition to date. Still, Nathanson said there are legitimate reasons to believe nothing will happen between Amazon and CBS, namely the Redstone family\u2019s controlling interest and upcoming court case. CBS declined to comment on the report, and a spokesperson for Amazon told CNBC they do not comment on rumors or speculation.

As tit-for-tat tariffs take effect in major global markets, some companies are already raising prices or making business changes to cope with higher costs. In response to Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Canada, Mexico and the European Union have each retaliated with duties on U.S. goods. Mexico's tariffs took effect June 5 on U.S. products such as pork, cheese, cranberries, whiskey and apples. The EU enacted tariffs Friday on more than $3 billion worth of U.S. goods including bourbon, yachts and motorcycles. Canada plans to implement tariffs on July 1 on up to roughly $12.5 billion in imports of U.S. products such as yogurt, caffeinated roasted coffee, toilet paper and sleeping bags. The White House's stated goal in implementing tariffs is protecting U.S. jobs, but the initial business response indicates U.S. companies are taking a hit. Here are some of the American-made goods that are being affected and the markets where their prices are going higher: Jack Daniel's \u2014 The price of a 700 ml bottle will go up about 10 percent in the EU as a result of the bloc's tariffs on certain U.S. goods, according to a statement from parent company Brown-Forman. show chapters Europe's bourbon tariff is a money grab, says Kentucky governor 8:16 AM ET Thu, 21 June 2018 | 04:16 Motorcycles \u2014 Harley-Davidson said Monday it is shifting some production overseas since EU tariffs will increase the average cost of a bike by $2,200. The duties will also reduce the Wisconsin-based company's 2018 profits by 5 to 8 percent, according to a CNBC analysis of Thomson Reuters data and Harley's cost projections. Rising steel prices due to the tariffs could trickle through to the prices of bikes for U.S. customers at some point, but the company so far is maintaining that it will eat the higher costs. show chapters Uncertainty and tariffs already hurting businesses, says pro 10:58 AM ET Wed, 27 June 2018 | 03:35 Nails \u2014 Mid-Continent Nail, the largest U.S. manufacturer of nails, has laid off 60 of its more than 500 workers after U.S. tariffs on steel imports raised its costs by about a third and as of Wednesday resulted in a 70 percent drop in orders for July, according to spokesperson James Glassman. Rather than buying from the Missouri-based company, customers are going to Chinese manufacturers who don't pay tariffs on domestically sourced steel and can export nails duty-free to the U.S., Glassman said. \"We can't continue to operate on this basis. ... We are asking the President and [Commerce Secretary] Wilbur Ross to grant an exclusion immediately because if that's not done, there's going to be 500 jobs lost.\" Cars \u2014 A 25 percent tariff on automobiles would increase the cost of every vehicle sold in the U.S., and the cost of the popular Toyota Camry, manufactured in Kentucky, would go up $1,800, Toyota said in a statement Wednesday. President Donald Trump threatened a 20 percent tariff on car imports last week. show chapters Toyota on auto tariffs: Even US-built Camry will see increased costs 4:55 PM ET Wed, 27 June 2018 | 03:24 Jeans \u2014 \"Unilateral tariff impositions risk retaliation and destabilizing the global economy, in which case American brands, workers and consumers will ultimately suffer,\" Levi Strauss said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg, according to a May report. The article added that Levi Strauss pledged to work with peers in the industry to show U.S. and EU leaders how the tariffs impact consumers and the \"millions of people across our supply chain.\" In the same report, Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz said the tariffs are \"one more thing to lose sleep on in this industry.\" Levi Strauss and Abercrombie did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Cranberries \u2014 The U.S. cranberry industry sells more than $127 million of cranberry products to the EU every year, according to Terry Humfeld, executive director of The Cranberry Institute. \"Since there is no domestic cranberry industry in the EU, costs could increase for manufacturers leading to higher prices for consumers, or reduced access to cranberries,\" Humfeld said in an emailed statement. Peanut butter is also on the EU's tariff list. But Hormel Foods, parent of Skippy, said in a statement to CNBC that its peanut butter sold in Europe is predominantly manufactured in that market and tariffs should not have a significant effect. Soybeans \u2014 China is set to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans and a total $34 billion worth of U.S. imports on July 6, in retaliation against the Trump administration\u2019s planned tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods set to take effect the same day. China is the world\u2019s largest consumer of soybeans and the second-largest destination for U.S. agriculture exports last year. If Beijing implements a 10 percent tariff, total U.S. soybean exports could fall 18 percent, according to a study for the U.S. Soybean Export Council by Purdue University agricultural economists Wally Tyner and Farzad Taheripou. A 30 percent tariff would likely result in a 40 percent drop in U.S. soybean exports, resulting in a 5 percent price drop over a few years, the analysis said. Soybean prices are down 8 percent so far this year, due largely to uncertainty over trade with China. \u2014 CNBC's Gillian Brassil , Juan Aruego and Tucker Higgins contributed to this report.

chapters Deutsche Bank CEO: We are committed to US unit 9:13 AM ET Fri, 29 June 2018 | 02:16 Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC on Friday the German banking giant remains committed to its U.S. unit even after failing the second round of annual Federal Reserve stress tests. The Fed said on Thursday it saw \"widespread and critical deficiencies\" in the bank's capital planning controls. Last week, Deutsche Bank cleared the Fed's easier first stress test hurdle, which measured capital levels against a severe recession, the strictest scenario ever run by the U.S. central bank. Sewing, who was appointed as CEO in April in an abrupt management reshuffling, acknowledged the Fed's new concerns, saying \"more needs to be done,\" but added \"we are confident to get over this over the next 12 months.\" Despite the troubles at its U.S. unit, Sewing said Deutsche Bank has no intention of getting rid of it. \"The U.S., next to Germany, is one of the most important markets we're in. And that will remain the case. It's a key market.\" The Fed stress test stumbles follow months of turmoil for Germany's largest lender, which has seen its shares tank about 44 percent this year. Sewing told CNBC the bank is now on the right path, after cleaning up its balance sheet and increasing capital over the past three years. \"Quarter after quarter, we've shown two things: Stable revenue and stable franchise,\" he said. \"We will show year-over-year an increase in profitability\" by 2019. However, Sewing said it still has work to do on creating \"sustainable profitability\" and getting \"more disciplined on our cost action.\" Responding to rumors earlier this month that Deutsche Bank might be interested in merging with rival Commerzbank, Sewing said management's top priority is getting its house in order. \"We have so much to do on our own and we have a clear focus for the next 18 months that we should execute on our homework,\" he said. The 47-year-old Sewing, a German national, was promoted to CEO about two months ago, replacing Briton John Cryan who had been at the helm since 2015. Cryan was ousted after investors had lost faith that he could return the bank to profitability after three consecutive years of losses. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

The good news is U.S. companies also have a record $2.1 trillion in cash to service that debt. The bad news is most of that cash is in the hands of a few giant companies. And the riskiest borrowers are more leveraged than they were even during the financial crisis, according to S&P's analysis, which looked at 2017 year-end balance sheets for non-financial corporations. On first glance, total debt has risen roughly $2.7 trillion over the past five years, with cash as a percentage of debt hovering around 33 percent for U.S. companies, flat compared to 2016. But removing the top 25 cash holders from the equation paints a grimmer picture. Speculative-grade borrowers, for example, reached a new record-low cash-to-debt ratio of just 12 percent in 2017, below the 14 percent reported in 2008 during the crisis. show chapters GE on path to reduce debt by $25 billion 9:02 AM ET Tue, 26 June 2018 | 05:09 \u201cThese borrowers have $8 of debt for every $1 of cash,\u201d wrote Andrew Chang, primary credit analyst at S&P Global. \u201cWe note these borrowers, many sponsor-owned, borrowed significant amounts under extremely favourable terms in a benign credit market to finance their buyouts at an ever-increasing purchase multiple without effectively improving their liquidity profiles.\u201d The trend persists even among highly rated borrowers: More than 450 investment-grade companies not among the top 1 percent of cash-rich issuers have cash-to-debt ratios more similar to those of speculative issuers, hovering around 21 percent. This could lead to trouble for the economy as interest rates rise. The Federal Reserve, which has already hiked rates twice so far this year, has indicated that further increases may be needed to keep the economy in check later in 2018. It has also actively reduced the amount of purchases it is making in the Treasury and mortgage markets.

The lender's consumer business in Asia, its largest outside North America, registered its seventh consecutive quarter of growth in the first three months of 2018. Underpinning that momentum is the growth in Citi's cards business, which the company said was largely a result of its decision about three years ago to \"digitize\" the way it operates. That means spending more of its advertising budget on digital ads, forming partnerships with e-commerce players and social media platforms, and building systems that allow people to apply for cards online, said Sergio Zanatti, Citibank\u2019s head of cards and personal loans for Asia. \"In the past, customers need to come to the bank, what we\u2019re trying to do is flip that completely: We want to be accessible to you as a customer in the place and in the way you prefer to interact. We want to be present in the place or ecosystem that you play and live,\" Zanatti told CNBC in an interview last week. That\u2019s a move away from waiting for customers to show up at physical branches and relying on large sales forces to get people to sign up for credit cards, he added. Instead, greater use of data analytics and digital channels allows the bank to target the right customers more efficiently and keep them around for longer, he explained. show chapters Deutsche Bank: Buy beaten-down Citi 1:49 PM ET Wed, 20 June 2018 | 02:49 Among the initiatives the lender has taken is launching banking services on social media applications such as Line, WeChat and Facebook Messenger in some markets in Asia \u2014 allowing customers to access information such as account balances, credit card transactions and even pay for certain bills. Citi is not the only one to make such changes to its consumer banking operations. Singapore's DBS, for example, launched retail banking services entirely on mobile in India and Indonesia \u2014 deepening its presence in those two countries without having to increase physical branches. Such digital initiatives by Citi and DBS are coming at a time when many banks in the region still require credit card applicants to fill out physical forms and queue up at branches to open an account, even as consumers in Asia increasingly prefer going online for such tasks. Asia taking the lead Many of the digital initiatives that Citi has rolled out in recent years started in Asia, where it caters to its largest consumer banking business outside of North America. In the first three months of 2018, the region saw revenue increasing 11 percent year-over-year to $1.93 billion and net income jumping 50 percent to $373 million over the same period. Citi's growth \u2014 which was sustained even as physical branches have been reduced \u2014 was in line with the improvements that banks have seen in the consumer segment. But the American lender's profitability still grew more than some of its peers in Asia. HSBC, Europe's largest bank with a large retail presence in Asia, reported a 20.8 percent year-over-year increase in first quarter pre-tax profit to $1.76 billion in its retail banking and wealth management business in the region. DBS, Southeast Asia's largest lender, saw the segment grew 17.4 percent to 627 million Singapore dollars ($458.6 million) in pre-tax profit over the same period. show chapters Citi beats Q1 estimates 8:19 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:48 Zanatti said he expects Citi's digital efforts to drive more business for the group. As of March 31, the lender had more than 16 million card accounts in Asia, delivering a 10 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its cards business in the region in the first quarter. \u201cWhen we started this journey probably three years ago, building the capabilities, building the technology, probably one out of 10 cards was digitally sourced. Now, it\u2019s three out of 10 and hopefully soon four out of 10 will be sourced digitally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transformation into a digital cards business clearly is the future. The cards business will become less paper, will become more digital, will become less plastic and will continue to evolve in that direction,\u201d he added.

Clough was told about this the week before the company \u2014 which supplies parts for power and energy companies \u2014 was set to hold its annual meeting in 2016. To him, it felt arbitrary, so he called around to his investors to better understand why. They told him that they were voting off of the recommendation of something called Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS. That\u2019s the largest and among the oldest of the so-called proxy advisory firms, which make voting recommendations for shareholders on issues like acquisitions, board composition and executive pay. So Clough called ISS. An analyst there told him that it urged shareholders to vote against one of his directors after Tualatin, Oregon-based CUI Global\u2019s board had changed its bylaws to make it harder for smaller investors to run an activist slate. But, the analyst told him, if he joins ISS for about $30,000 per year, the firm can help him better navigate these mishaps in the future. He was able to call his investors and get them to change their votes before the meeting, preserving the director for one more year (unlike political elections, shareholders are able to vote as many times as they would like up until the annual meeting). Clough, who had been a cop for 16 years, said this reminded him of a protection racket, whereby a group uses the threat of violence to provide protection outside the confines of law enforcement. Ultimately, he said, he\u2019ll have to pay for ISS\u2019 protection. \u201cThere\u2019s really no way to fight this,\u201d Clough said. \u201cUltimately, we will have to join because for us to go through this year after year just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Congress taking action In the meantime, he\u2019s hopeful for a piece of legislation that\u2019s working its way through Congress called the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017. The bill passed the House in December by a vote of 238-182 and is at the top of the agenda on Thursday for a Senate Banking Committee hearing on corporate governance. The bill would require proxy advisory firms to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and allow companies to fact-check the research before it\u2019s distributed to investors. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., who introduced the bill says this oversight is necessary to prevent any abuse of power by proxy advisory firms. Bill Clark | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc. \u201cThey hold companies hostage and make them buy services,\u201d Duffy said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s like Vinny down the street who says, \u2018Hey look, I\u2019ll protect your store and if you don\u2019t pay, we\u2019re going to come in at night and you know what happens.\u2019\u201d ISS, however, believes this bill would \u201cdeprive shareholders of the independent proxy advice they need to have a meaningful say in corporate governance.\u201d The firm says that even though institutional investors are the clients who pay for the research, the bill would give management \u201cveto power,\u201d an \u201cunprecedented effort to stifle recommendations.\u201d \u201cThis legislation purports to take aim at proxy advisers,\u201d said Patrick McGurn, special counsel for ISS, in an interview. \u201cIt really takes aim at individual investors. Large investors oppose bill Nearly 50 large investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or CalSTRS, and the New York state comptroller, signed onto a letter to Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, opposing the bill. The letter, which was put together by the Council of Institutional Investors, said proxy advisory firms play an important role in enabling effective and cost-effective independent research. \u201cIf enacted, the proposed legislation would increase costs for pension plans and other institutional investors with no clear benefits,\u201d the letter said. But for Bill Clough, the hand-wringing continued. In 2017, CUI Global faced something like deja vu. The company had deployed a director to temporarily take over one of its subsidiaries in the U.K. Clough says he ensured that this complied with Nasdaq and SEC regulations, but later learned the move did not match the standards of ISS. This time, instead of going to shareholders, Clough said he went right to ISS. The firm recommended that shareholders vote against all of CUI\u2019s independent directors. \u201cSo I asked her what we should do because I didn\u2019t want to have to go back to my shareholders and make it seem like we\u2019re in a war,\u201d Clough said. Ultimately, CUI announced that it was appointing a new independent director and ISS changed its voting recommendation. Shortly thereafter, Clough recalls a similar proposition. ISS told him, \u201cIf you were a member, you could avoid all this, it would really be a lot smoother,\u201d Clough said. He is anxiously awaiting the company\u2019s next annual meeting in December.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch says investors should avoid Walgreens Boots Alliance shares as Amazon enters the pharmacy business. Shares of drugstore companies are tumbling Thursday after Amazon announced it signed an agreement to acquire online pharmacy PillPack. The firm lowered its rating for the drugstore chain\u2019s shares to underperform from neutral due to declining investor sentiment. \u201cWBA currently is dealing with a number of business headwinds driving pressure on core script growth while also suffering from slower front-of-store growth due to a strategic pivot towards more private label/higher gross margin products,\u201d analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients Thursday. \"The newly-introduced Amazon threat, even if it doesn\u2019t have an immediate financial impact on WBA, will create longer-term competitive questions as well as uncertainty around the multiple,\" the analyst added. \"In the interim we see WBA as particularly under pressure as it works through its partnership plans. Because of this, we expect the stock to remain range-bound (even with today\u2019s intraday stock move).\" Rite Aid plunged 11 percent, Walgreens Boots Alliance sank 10 percent, and CVS Health fell 8 percent, respectively. Cherny lowered his price target for Walgreens Boots Alliance shares to $60 from $73. Walgreens Boots Alliance acknowledged Amazon's move into the online pharmacy space. \"Yes, it's a declaration of intent from Amazon,\" CEO Stefano Pessina said in a planned call to discuss its quarterly earnings, according to an initial transcript from FactSet. \"[But] the pharmacy world is much more complex than the delivery of a certain [pill or] packages.\" Walgreens shares were down slightly more than 1 percent in Thursday's premarket session after the company reported its third-quarter earnings results and announced a $10 billion share buyback. Then the Amazon-PillPack news was released, and Walgreens shares traded sharply lower. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Bank of America note.

Netflix\u2019s global subscription expansion as well as gradual pricing increases put the company\u2019s stock on track for even more upside over the next year, according to Macquarie Research. The firm raised its price target on the online video streamer\u2019s shares to $430 from $336, reiterating its outperform rating and citing uplift in subscriptions to higher tiers as people buy more high-end televisions and demand video of higher quality. Netflix shares rebounded 1.29 percent Thursday. The high flyer fell 2.25 percent on Wednesday and is down 5 percent over the last five days as investors take profits into the end of the quarter. Netflix stock has still doubled on the year. The new price target represents more than 10 percent upside from Wednesday\u2019s close. \u201cPenetration rates are rising, and Netflix enjoys pricing leverage as well as an underlying rise in average revenue per unit from tiering up both in the U.S. and internationally,\u201d analyst Tim Nollen said in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cPlus Netflix is well-entrenched with telco and pay TV distributors worldwide, which adds subscribers and minimizes churn.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t know what the right numbers to use are but history has shown Netflix has beaten all prior estimates \u2013 so numbers can go higher,\u201d he added. As one of the largest technology companies on Wall Street, Netflix stock has enjoyed significant upside over the past 12 months, even when compared with other industry giants. The company's shares have scaled more than 150 percent over the past year, well ahead of Facebook\u2019s 27 percent gain and Google parent Alphabet\u2019s 16 percent climb. For his part, Nollen believes international subscriptions will reach 113 million by 2019 and raised his 2019 earnings per share estimate to $5 from $4.44, significantly higher than consensus estimates provided by FactSet. Still, concerns remain over growing competition from Amazon and Walt Disney, both of which have bolstered their own online offerings over the past two years. Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in April that the company still has a long road ahead to compete with the likes of YouTube, and noted that Netflix's ability to raise prices relies on its ability to provide unique value. \u201cIf we get lazy or slow, we'll be run over just like anybody else,\u201d Hastings said at the time. Macquarie\u2019s Nollen, who upgraded his rating on shares of Netflix to outperform in January, said he believes any serious competition is still a ways off. \u201cThe marketplace is also seeing ever-increasing volumes of high-quality original content released by competing platforms and we weigh this in considering whether consumers could develop some reluctance to take on too many subscriptions,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cBut we think any real threat from competing over-the-top services is still some way off \u2013 at least until Disney\u2019s service comes online in fall 2019 \u2013 or until recession hits and causes consumers to pare down.\u201d ", "author": "Akio Kon | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/netflixs-success-overseas-spell-upside-for-shareholders-analyst-says.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Akio Kon", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Reed Hastings", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Netflix Inc.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tokyo", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Japan", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the next year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Macquarie Research", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "430", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "336", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "1.29 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2.25 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the last five days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the end of the quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Tim Nollen", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the past 12 months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 150 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the past year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "27 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Alphabet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "16 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Nollen", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "113 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "5", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "4.44", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "FactSet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Walt Disney", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the past two years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Reed Hastings", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "YouTube", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Hastings", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Macquarie", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Nollen", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "January", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Disney", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "fall 2019 \u2013 or", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Netflix\u2019s global expansion as well as gradual pricing increases put the company\u2019s stock on track for even more upside, according one Wall Street firm.", "title": "Netflix shares rebound after\u00a0Macquarie raises price target, citing global growth and pricing power", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/10/17/104777362-GettyImages-543270558.jpg?v=1530187331"}, {"time": "2018-06-29T13:15:10-0400", "body": " Getty Images Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks at the final event of the 2018 Presidential Campaign at Azteca Stadium on June 27, 2018 in Mexico City, Mexico. All eyes will be on Mexico\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, but the key to the country\u2019s future will rest on how the congressional contests shake out. According to a poll conducted in late June by Mexico-based Parametria, the left-wing Morena party is poised to win the most seats in the lower house and the Senate. The poll showed Morena had 41 percent of voter support in the Chamber of Deputies and 38 percent in the Senate. Morena is led by leftist firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known by his initials AMLO, who holds a commanding lead in the country\u2019s presidential race. Some of Lopez Obrador\u2019s policy proposals have scared investors intodumping Mexican stocks, however, fearing they will cripple Mexico\u2019s economy. But whether or not Lopez Obrador can move forward with them will depend on how much support from Ccongress he gets. \u201cThe main factor people should be looking out for is the composition of the lower house and Senate,\u201d said Reggie Thompson, Latin America analyst at Stratfor. \u201cThat\u2019s really going to determine what kind of legislative measures he will pursue.\u201d \u201cIf AMLO wins by a significant threshold and gets a majority in Congress, that will signal a very significant shift in Mexican politics on a very fundamental level,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get a majority, \u2026 he\u2019ll be far less powerful.\u201d Lopez Obrador wants to give free access to telecommunication services like the internet and to double the pension for the elderly. He also wants to reverse key reforms enacted by the current administration that opened Mexico\u2019s energy industry so that oil never \u201cfalls back into the hands of foreigners.\u201d AMLO, the former mayor of Mexico City, is the runaway favorite to win the Mexican presidency. A poll released last Sunday by Mexico City-based Consulta Mitofsky showed Lopez Obrador with 37.7 percent of voter support. Candidates Ricardo Anaya and Jose Antonio Meade lagged with just 20 percent and 17.7 percent of voter support, respectively. \u201cAMLO\u2019s expected victory possibly represents the largest change in the political regime of the country in modern times,\u201d Cristobal Arias, Latin America economist at TS Lombard, wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cMoreover, his victory could lead to significant gains in congressional seats too, as Mexicans have historically voted for the same party in both the presidential and congressional ballots.\u201d His campaign gained momentum in part because of his pledge to fight widespread corruption plaguing the country. AMLO said Wednesday that, if elected, \u201cthe country will be cleansed\u201d of corruption, adding he would \u201cpull up by its roots the corrupt regime,\u201d which he blames for the country\u2019s chronic violence and widespread poverty. May was the deadliest month on record in Mexico, with nearly 3,000 people being killed, according to government data. Leading up to Sunday\u2019s election, more than100 politicians have been killed. In all, more than 13,000 Mexicans have been slain since January. About 40 percent of the county\u2019s population lives in poverty, according to World Bank data. \u201cCorruption is one of the top issues with Mexicans just exacerbated by what they have seen,\u201d said Jason Marczak, the director of Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. \u201cThe Mexican people will be looking for someone who will address those concerns.\u201d Fearing the potentially negative impact of AMLO\u2019s economic policies, investors have pushed Mexican stocks down sharply. The iShares MSCI Mexico exchange-traded fund (EWW), which tracks Mexican equities, is down 8.9 percent this quarter. The peso is down 8.4 percent over the past three months against the dollar despite a 6.1 percent percent rally over the past two weeks. \u201cWe suspect market participants under-rate the negative implications of an AMLO presidency,\u201d Rafael Elias, an analyst at Exotix Capital, wrote in a note earlier this month. Elias added that \u201can absolute congressional majority for [AMLO\u2019s] Morena party would come as an unwelcome surprise.\u201d The rise of AMLO and Morena comes as Mexico continues negotiations with Canada and the United States on a new trade deal. President Donald Trump has railed against the current deal, NAFTA, calling it the worst ever. Trade tensions between the U.S. and Mexico have risen recently. Earlier this month, Mexico slapped tariffs on several agriculture products, including pork, cheese and apples. Mexico implemented the charges in retaliation for U.S. levies on Mexican steel and aluminum products. \u201cAMLO supports NAFTA but would not bet on fostering international relations, particularly in an era of trade tensions,\u201d said TS Lombard's Arias. \u201cWhile we expect the NAFTA negotiations to resume after the election on 1 July, we believe the next administration will take a nationalist stance on NAFTA while it pursues the trade diversification agenda introduced by the current government in light of US protectionism.\u201d ", "author": "Getty Images", "link":

Jefferies is less optimistic over the prospects of Walgreens Boots Alliance due to Amazon's move into the pharmacy business. Shares of drugstore companies plunged Thursday after Amazon announced it signed an agreement to acquire online pharmacy PillPack before the market open. The firm lowered its rating to hold from buy on the drugstore chain\u2019s shares, predicting more investor uncertainty due to the threat from Amazon. \u201cAlthough we value WBA's independence and their ongoing efforts to transition the retail pharmacy box into a HC services-orientated business, we believe recent fundamental softness makes it difficult to refute concerns about the risk AMZN brings, especially with their acquisition of mail order pharmacy PillPack,\u201d analyst Brian Tanquilut said in a note to clients Friday. \u201cWe believe that the NT earnings impact to WBA from AMZN's acquisition of PillPack is likely immaterial, but the perception and concern that AMZN will successfully integrate PillPack into its consumer offering (1-2 years out) will likely weigh on WBA stock NT and potentially impact actual earnings performance LT.\u201d Tanquilut lowered his price target to $65 from $85 for Walgreens Boots Alliance shares, representing 9 percent upside to Thursday\u2019s close. Walgreens Boots Alliance acknowledged Amazon's move into the online pharmacy space during its earnings conference call with investors Thursday. \"Yes, it's a declaration of intent from Amazon,\" said Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina on the call, according to a transcript from FactSet. \"[But] the pharmacy world is much more complex than the delivery of a certain [pill or] packages.\" Walgreens shares were down slightly more than 1 percent in Thursday's premarket session after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings results and announced a $10 billion share buyback. Then the Amazon-PillPack news was released, and Walgreens shares traded sharply lower and ended the day down 9.9 percent.

Another former Equifax employee is facing insider trading charges. Federal prosecutors said Thursday they charged a former software development manager, Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, with insider trading. He is scheduled for arraignment Thursday by a federal magistrate in Atlanta. The charge came nearly four months after the former chief information officer of an Equifax business unit was accused of similar charges. Prosecutors said the insider trading against Bonthu related to the massive data breach last July that Equifax disclosed to the public in September. The breach affected the records of 143 million people, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges against Bonthu on Thursday. Bonthu, 44, was fired in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company's insider trading policy. The SEC says Bonthu worked on creating a website for consumers who were affected by the breach. He had been told the work was for a client but surmised it was for Equifax itself, and in the days before the breach became public he placed a bet in the options market that Equifax shares would fall. show chapters Former Equifax exec charged with insider trading 11:14 AM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 01:10 His profit was $75,000, the SEC said. Bonthu has agreed to return the money plus interest and to a permanent injunction to settle the SEC charges. In a statement, Atlanta-based Equifax said, \u201cUpon learning about the sales of Equifax shares by Mr. Bonthu, we immediately launched a review of his trading activity and separated him from our company after he declined to cooperate with our inquiry. We are fully cooperating with the SEC and the Department of Justice, and will continue to do so. We take corporate governance and compliance very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of our policies.\u201d After the data breach was revealed, questions about executives selling shares in the company emerged. Four top executives sold nearly $2 million of stock just days after the breach was discovered internally but weeks before the public was informed. A special committee of the board found that the sales by these executives were not improper and that they didn't know about the breach at the time of the sales. But another executive, Jun Ying, was indicted in March of insider trading. Prosecutors say he used inside knowledge and sold the equivalent of $950,000 of stock before the breach was made public and Equifax shares dropped 14 percent. Richard Best, director of the SEC's Atlanta bureau, said in a statement Thursday, \"Corporate insiders simply cannot abuse their access to sensitive information and illegally enrich themselves.\u201d The SEC said the investigation is continuing.

led bank stocks higher Friday as most of the biggest U.S. lenders announced plans to boost stock repurchases and quarterly dividends by billions of dollars after passing the Federal Reserve's annual stress test. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo was the \"big winner\" from this year's annual regulatory ritual because investors had feared the scandal-ridden company would get dinged on the qualitative portion of the exam, according to a research note from Macquarie analyst David Konrad entitled \"WFC wins the day.\" Earlier this year, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to cap its assets until it could improve its operational controls amid revelations of sales practice abuses. Instead, Wells Fargo passed and won permission to buy back $24.5 billion in shares, more than double last year's and clobbering Konrad's $15.5 billion estimate. Wells Fargo surged almost 6 percent at 11:04 a.m. in New York trading. Meanwhile shares of Citigroup rose 2.1 percent, while J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America rose less than 1.5 percent. CItigroup said it would hike its quarterly dividend 13 cents, to 45 cents a share, and buy back $17.6 billion of stock over the next year after passing the Fed's annual stress test. J.P. Morgan Chase announced it would raise its quarterly dividend to 80 cents a share from 56 cents, and buy back up to $20.7 billion in stock. The Fed gave 34 of the biggest banks the go-ahead to pay dividends and buy back stock after the second part of annual stress tests, it announced Thursday. For firms that disclosed their plan approvals, the total capital return rose 22 percent to $172 billion, according to JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan. \"We characterize the overall outcome for the group as a modest positive, on balance representing another year of forward progress,\" Ryan said in a Thursday research note. Only the U.S. unit of Deutsche Bank had an outright failure in the exam, limiting the German lender's ability to pull in dividend payments from its American business. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley received conditional approval but will only be paying out roughly what they did last year. Morgan Stanley said it would raise its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 25 cents and buy back $4.7 billion of stock, consistent with the $6.8 billion in capital it returned over the last year. Goldman said it would raise its dividend by 5 cents to 85 cents a share in the second quarter of 2019 and buy back $5 billion of stock, not going over $6.3 billion. Both firms disappointed expectations for capital return, and their shares rose less than 0.5 percent. It is the second year of massive capital return announcements. Last year, J.P.

Morgan Stanley told its clients that the internet giant should defend its retail ad sales turf by giving away its Home Mini devices, and it wouldn't cost that much. \u201cWe argue Alphabet needs more devices/smart speakers in people's homes.

He reiterated his overweight rating on the company\u2019s shares and raised his price target to $1,250 from $1,200 because of Alphabet's long-term opportunity to increase its profits.

Morgan Chase to Citigroup were allowed to boost distributions. The New York-based investment banks were ensnared by the administration\u2019s tax cut, which resulted in a one-time drop in the capital ratios of the firms, according to the Federal Reserve. Specifically, when accounting for the dividends and buybacks the firms originally wanted to pay, the banks fell beneath minimum required ratios for capital levels called tier 1 leverage and supplementary leverage under a scenario of financial distress. As a result, regulators gave them conditional non-objections to their subdued capital plans \u2014 but stopped short of failing them because of the one-time nature of the tax charge, according to a briefing with reporters. Keeping the total amount of their payouts at the same level as last year will enable the firms to build a larger cushion for next year. Shares of Goldman and Morgan fell briefly in early trading Friday despite a broad rally in financial stocks. Goldman and Morgan were up less than 0.3 percent while Wells Fargo advanced 5.4 percent at 10:05 a.m. Before last week\u2019s red flag, analysts and investors had reason to believe the banks could raise their total payouts. The industry has been recovering, increasing earnings to a record in the first quarter. Getty Images James Gorman of Morgan Stanley and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Instead, Goldman Sachs said it would return no more than $6.3 billion in capital in the year starting in the third quarter. It is raising its dividend 5 cents to 85 cents a share, but that doesn't kick in until next year's second quarter. Morgan Stanley said it would distribute an amount consistent with the $6.8 billion it gave out last year, including raising its dividend by 5 cents to 30 cents a share beginning in the third quarter this year. \"Morgan Stanley was definitely a disappointment on the buyback, and Goldman was on the low end of the range I was expecting,\" said Charlie Peabody, analyst at Portales Partners. Even though the companies said they would raise their dividends, the payouts are lower than expectations, Peabody said. Morgan Stanley's annual $1.20 a share dividend compares with expectations for $1.24, and Goldman's $3.20 a share dividend compares with expectations for $3.36. After the two banks squeaked by the initial version of the test last week, they both issued public statements indicating confidence they could return more capital to shareholders than the regulators\u2019 figures suggested. \u201cOur models and the Federal Reserve\u2019s models diverge, which we expect to discuss with the Federal Reserve,\u201d Goldman said at the time. In the annual ritual, banks must show that they can survive an economic downturn with enough capital to keep lending, while taking into account the capital leaving in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Capital, the difference between a bank\u2019s assets and liabilities, is the cushion banks use to absorb unexpected losses. The 2018 version used one of the most severe hypothetical economic scenarios since starting the tests in 2009. It assumed unemployment at 10 percent, losses in corporate and real estate loans, and difficult conditions overseas. After the tax overhaul was announced late last year, Goldman Sachs said earnings were taking a $5 billion hit, mostly tied to a bill from repatriating earnings. Morgan Stanley took a $1.4 billion hit because of the lowered value of deferred tax assets. Another bank, Boston-based State Street, also got a conditional non-objection. It has to take steps to improve its management of counterparty risk under stressful scenarios. But the Fed saved its worst grade for the U.S. division of Deutsche Bank, which the Fed has previously deemed a troubled institution. The Fed said it objected to the capital plan of DB USA over concerns about the firm\u2019s management of data and its capital planning and weaknesses in forecasting revenues and losses. U.S. shares of Deutsche Bank fell about 1 percent in extended trading Thursday. The banks can also resubmit their capital plans before next year\u2019s tests to request more payouts, the Fed noted. While 35 banks were included in this year\u2019s stress test, only 18 of the biggest and most complex institutions had to go through both qualitative and quantitative parts of the exam. Of those, 15 firms won a clear thumbs up from the Fed and will be allowed to proceed with their planned pay-outs, which could include hikes in dividends and buybacks. So banks from J.P. Morgan Chase to Bank of America should be able to proceed as their executives have planned. That also includes Wells Fargo, which analysts had speculated could be dogged by its misconduct issues for the qualitative part of the exam. \u201cEven with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,\u201d said Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles. Big banks have more than doubled their capital levels since the financial crisis, thanks in part to greater supervision including the annual stress tests. Still, bank executives have complained publicly that they now hold too much capital, restraining their ability to increase pay-outs.

While the start-up is relatively small with about $100 million in revenue last year, it could serve as a beachhead for Amazon\u2019s broader ambitions in health care. Here are three major ways this could change the way Americans get their medications, according to Arielle Trzcinski, senior Forrester analyst covering health-care technology. 1. Same-day delivery through Prime \u201cIf I\u2019m discharged from a hospital or a doctor\u2019s office with a prescription, I\u2019m going and waiting in line at CVS or Walgreens. That goes away with the incorporation of PillPack; I no longer have to go and wait in line. I see this getting incorporated into the Prime delivery process, potentially for same-day delivery in the areas that\u2019s available. Where it\u2019s not, if it\u2019s not your initial prescription, maybe your refills. \u201cI think it\u2019s a game-changer for folks like Walgreens and CVS, who will see a significant hit. People want a convenient, personalized process for healthcare. They want a more retail-like experience tailored to them and their needs. Beyond that, a number of chronic disease patients tend to have limited mobility or barriers in terms of transportation. Now we\u2019re eliminating the barrier of having them get to the brick and mortar.\u201d 2. Amazon\u2019s voice assistant Alexa \u201cAlexa\u2019s already being used in a number of pilots to capture information from patients in their homes, doing everything from medication reminders to helping them order a Lyft to get them to an appointment. So if you think about Alexa reminding you to take your medication, it also knows how much you have left to take. Amazon would automate that process, and say, 'Okay, I know we\u2019re nearing the end of the month, so I\u2019ll automatically refill your prescription to make sure you get that on time.' \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take your drugs, is there an opportunity for Alexa to also engage with that patient in a conversational way, to say 'How do you feel today?' It could alert the provider to say, this patient might be experiencing negative side effects that leads to non-adherence of medication. Here\u2019s what I captured from this patient, you may want to pick up the phone and call them.\u201d 3. The Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway-JPMorgan health-care venture \u201cA lot of the work Dr. Atul Gawande [CEO of the new joint venture] has done has focused on costs. PillPack being incorporated into Amazon should help them target that cost conundrum we\u2019re in. They\u2019ve said, how do we control chronic conditions, and medication non-adherence [patients neglecting to take their drugs] is a huge issue when it comes to chronic conditions; it\u2019s a driver for hospitalizations. It's a significant driver of cost in the healthcare world. Alexa can be there to help remind patients to take that medication. I\u2019ve seen the cost of non-adherence being from $100 billion to $250 billion a year.\u201d Shares of drugstore companies Rite Aid, Walgreens Boots Alliance and CVS health all plunged Thursday after the news, losing about $12.8 billion in market value. Amazon spent just under $1 billion for PillPack, snatching the business from rival Walmart, according to TechCrunch. CNBC reported on Walmart\u2019s interest in PillPack in April and that Amazon had also held discussions with the Boston-based start-up.

According to cryptocurrency trader Ran Neu-Ner, it's likely to go even lower. \"There's more blood to come,\" Neu-Ner, who is host of CNBC Africa's \"Crypto Trader,\" said Thursday on \"Fast Money.\" Bitcoin traded down 3.3 percent at $5,885.60 as of 6:54 a.m. ET on Friday morning. \"Right now my money is on the market continuing to go down,\" he said. In fact, Neu-Ner said there's more than a 60 percent chance of a crypto bear market \u2014 compared with a 16 percent chance of a bull market. \"And a bear market means we're going to test $5,350\" as the new low, the founder of OnChain Capita said. This isn't the first time Neu-Ner has had a grim outlook for bitcoin. Earlier this month, he said the coin could drop as low as $5,000. Some say bitcoin mining, or the cost of production, outweighs gains once the price of bitcoin drops to around $8,000. But Neu-Ner said mining costs outweigh profits at around $5,000. \"That's where the miners look at this and go: 'Is it actually worth keeping the machine on?\"' Neu-Ner said earlier in June. \"Then we may see a very different game in mining.\" Neu-Ner reiterated those comments on Thursday and said bitcoin will soon reach a point where \"miners find it's not viable to mine.

As for bitcoin, the price will continue to drop. \"I'm calling $5,350 in the next week or two,\" Neu-Ner said. While the trader said bitcoin is not a wise investment in the near term, he said now is a good time to consider long-term investments. \"If you understand the technology and you're a bull, then now is a great time to be buying,\" Neu-Ner said. \"The blockchain is progressing and this thing isn't going away,\" he said. Chesnot | Getty Images A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, displayed on December 23, 2017 in Paris, France. But crypto investors have been on edge in recent weeks. Bitcoin fell below $6,000 earlier this month for the first time since February, leaving many to wonder if the crypto phase had indeed ended. The coin bounced back only a few days later. Still, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is nowhere near its December peak when it was priced around $19,500. Alternatives While Neu-Ner anticipates further declines in bitcoin, he still calls himself a crypto bull. To determine his next bets in the market, he's looking at blockchain technology and infrastructure. \"It's a toss up for me among two coins,\" he said. Those two coins are neo, the currency used for a Chinese platform similar to ethereum, and Cardano's Ada cryptocurrency. \"It's a blockchain protocol,\" Neu-Ner said, referring to the Cardano system. \"Which I think is highly undervalued.\" WATCH: Bitcoin bull Brian Kelly says bitcoin isn't dead yet show chapters 'Fast Money' trader Brian Kelly says bitcoin isn't dead yet 5:37 PM ET Fri, 22 June 2018 | 04:01 ", "author": "Chesnot | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-is-below-6000-but-these-other-cryptos-are-hot-says-trader.html", "keywords": [{"term": "7:39 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "28", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "05:42", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "6,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Ran Neu-Ner", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC Africa's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Crypto Trader", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fast Money", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "3.3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "5,885.60", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "6:54 a.m. ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "morning", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "more than a 60 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "16 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "5,350", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "OnChain Capita", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "as low as $5,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "around $8,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Neu-Ner", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "around $5,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "earlier in June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "5,350", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the next week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "December 23, 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Paris", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "France", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "recent weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "6,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "February", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "only a few days later", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "around $19,500", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Cardano", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Cardano", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitcoin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Brian Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Brian Kelly", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "5:37 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "22", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "description": "Bitcoin falls below $6,000 for the second time this month and one crypto trader says it will go lower in the next two weeks.", "title": "Bitcoin dips below $6,000, and one crypto trader says it will go lower.

The NATO summit in Brussels on July 11 and 12 is an opportunity for President Donald Trump to get the trans-Atlantic relations back on a constructive path \u2014 the place they should have never left. It is absurd to think and say, as some do, that the European Union was created as an opponent to the United States. The EU remains a peace project where economic integration is a means of strengthening that epochal mission. The founding fathers sought to guarantee Europe\u2019s peace by keeping France and Germany, the centuries-old sworn enemies, off each other\u2019s throats. To do that, they put, in the early 1950s, these countries\u2019 instruments of war \u2014 coal and steel \u2014 in a jointly managed organization called the European Coal and Steel Community. Successive stages of integration led to the European Common Market, the European Economic Community and the European Union. The U.S. was fully involved in the initial stages of that peace project with large funds, and some of its best and brightest diplomats working alongside their European colleagues. Since then, the EU has been an important part of American foreign policies, in spite of occasional lapses of focus and attention as Washington had to attend to more pressing problems around the world. It, therefore, seems very likely that America\u2019s apparent distraction from trans-Atlantic affairs might have led to issues of unbalanced trade and improper burden sharing of allied security obligations. The US must stay fully engaged in Europe Trump has justifiably put Germany at the heart of both problems. Accounting for a quarter of the EU economy, that country sets the pace to the market taking $283.5 billion of American goods exports \u2014 nearly one-fifth of the total, and more than double of all U.S. sales to China. Germany also hosts America\u2019s largest military installations in Europe. Taken in that perspective, Germany\u2019s $64 billion trade surplus with the U.S. is small beer. Trump can easily find ways with Berlin to stop and reverse that trade imbalance because Germans are ready and eager for a constructive dialogue. Washington and Berlin have to look much beyond the narrow-minded trade skirmishes. With their two economies representing half of the industrialized world\u2019s demand and output, they have to work closely to strengthen the trans-Atlantic security architecture so that the Western world order can deal with powerful new players. Several recent examples of what happens when the U.S. and Germany don\u2019t work together come to mind. Think of the ravages caused in the early years of this decade when Germany imposed fiscal austerity on European countries already sinking into deep recessions. The soaring unemployment and poverty that followed paved the way for populist movements that have currently taken power \u2014 or are seriously threatening the established political forces \u2014 in a number of EU member states. Washington did nothing to prevent those absurd policies that devastated the market for its huge export sales, and an area critical to its national security. Greece and the EU\u2019s current migration debacle are two more examples where the U.S. chose to stand aside while Germany wreaked havoc with the destiny of an entire country, compromised the stability of the NATO alliance and endangered peace and prosperity on a continent that lit up the world twice in the last century. With an apparently clueless Washington, utterly frightened by Berlin\u2019s plans, in the summer of 2012, to throw Greece out of the euro area, France had to step in to put a stop to German mischief. A strong West to deal with new powers Anybody interested in seeing what a destruction of the Greek economy would have meant to the U.S. national security can consult NATO\u2019s website. Greece is hosting American-operated military facilities controlling the Eastern Mediterranean, part of West Balkans, North Africa and the Middle East. The Greek tragedy is a case where Germany bears direct responsibility. Serving as a de facto boss of the Eurogroup \u2014 a forum of the euro area finance ministers monitoring the group\u2019s economic management \u2014 Germany could have corrected Greece\u2019s allegedly wrong policies and stopped a widely suspected tempering with public finance accounts. Berlin did nothing, and then made things worse by dragging its feet, meting out cruel \u201crestructuring\u201d punishments and saddling Athens with an unbearable 325 billion euro of public debt. Washington looked the other way, but it now realizes the importance of having a deeply wounded Greece on board, while other regional alliances look increasingly questionable. Europe\u2019s ongoing migration crisis is another tragedy caused by Germany. Dressed up as a humanitarian gesture, migrants and refugees were allegedly invited to relieve the country\u2019s growing labor market shortages \u2014 an initiative derided by a French philosopher as \u201cviolins and adding machines.\u201d Humanitarian considerations aside, it is odd that Germany would call on migrants to fill its employment vacancies instead of giving jobs to millions of EU workers facing jobless rates ranging, in 2014-2015, from 11 percent in France to 13 percent in Italy, 14 percent in Portugal, 23 percent in Spain and 26 percent in Greece. And then, when Berlin realized it could not handle the migrants\u2019 influx, it further divided Europe by seeking to impose mandatory immigrant quotas on countries that had not even been consulted beforehand about Germany\u2019s unilateral decisions. Those huge policy blunders have now put German democracy in danger. The established center-right and center-left governing coalition parties are losing ground, while the nationalist and xenophobic hard-right Alternative for Germany has gone from zero votes in 2013 to 15 percent, and counting, in the latest opinion polls. As a principal stakeholder in the Western world order, Washington cannot watch all that with a distracted eye, and keep harping on divisive and relatively small trade and financing issues. No, the true task is to keep the EU, with Germany at its core, firmly anchored in a strong and closely-knit trans-Atlantic community. Investment thoughts Trump has a stage, a chance, and a historic duty to rise to the occasion as a pacifier, unifier and a builder of a frightened and fragmented trans-Atlantic community when he meets with his NATO allies in Brussels next week. That\u2019s what financial markets are expecting for a new impetus to asset prices. Trade chaos and a disintegrating West are depressing the markets at a time when no further support can be expected from the monetary and fiscal policies. The Europeans are hoping for the best, but are ready for the worst. The president of the European Council (a forum of heads of state and government) has warned that Trump is a divisive and unpredictable figure. As historian Arnold Toynbee would say, \u201chistory is again on the move.\u201d America is challenged to show the way.

Reuters Donald Trump speaking from the White House, June 29, 2018. President Donald Trump said Sunday he wants to wait until after the midterm elections to move forward on a new NAFTA deal with Mexico and Canada, with the parties locked in tough negotiations. The Congressional midterms are scheduled for Nov. 6, with Democrats poised to gain seats in the House, and possibly retake a majority. Separately, trade tensions between the three NAFTA principals have increased recently, with the U.S. slapped import tariffs on Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum imports. Both Mexico and Canada have retaliated with levies on U.S. goods of their own, targeting yogurt, toilet paper, whiskey, apples pork and cheese, among others. The simmering trade disputes have made it even more difficult to strike a new North American accord. \u201cNAFTA, I could sign it tomorrow, but I\u2019m not happy with it,\u201d Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview. \u201cI want to make it more fair.\u201d He added: \u201cI want to wait until after the election. You\u2019re going to have an election. I think it\u2019ll be very interesting. I think it\u2019s going to be fine. Trump also threatened new levies on car imports: \"If they\u2019re not fine, I\u2019m going to tax their cars coming into America. That\u2019s the big one,\u201d he said. Trump has repeatedly railed against NAFTA, a trade deal signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico signed in 1993, calling it the worst deal ever. The fight has mirrored his broad skepticism over trade agreements in general, with the president repeatedly citing America's trade deficits as evidence that the world's largest economy is being systematically disadvantaged by its trading partners. These tensions have increased volatility in financial markets, with U.S. stocks falling more than 1 percent last week. European and Asian equities also fell broadly as the tensions added to market uncertainty. Still, Trump proclaimed to Fox Business that \u201cI love free trade. When I was at the G-7 I said: \u2018I have an idea: Nobody pay any more tax and you take down your barriers,\" he said. \"No barriers, no tax.\u2019 \u2026 You know what happened? Everybody said: \u2018Can we get on to another subject?\u2019\u201d The Trump administration has also targeted the European Union on trade, threatening to slap a 20 percent tariff on cars coming to the U.S. from the EU. The U.S. also slapped charges on aluminum and steel imports from Europe. \u201cThe European Union is possibly just as bad as China. They\u2019re just smaller,\u201d Trump told the network. \u201cThey treat us very badly. They treat us very unfairly.\u201d Trump also lashed out at OPEC and the price of oil, and whether the market was being manipulated as crude recently hit its highest in more than 3 years. \u201cOPEC is [manipulating prices], and they better stop it because we're protecting those countries, many of those countries. OPEC is manipulating.\" At a meeting last month, OPEC members announced they would increase production, but did not specify by how much.

Dell Technologies plans to announce an acquisition of its publicly traded tracking stock that mirrors the performance of VMware, in a cash-and-stock deal as early as Sunday, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The deal, which was also reported by The Wall Street Journal, will eliminate the tracking stock but will leave VMware unaffected. It temporarily concludes months of deliberation about strategic options from Dell and its board. Dell will offer DVMT shareholders \"significantly\" more DHI common stock (Dell's privately held shares) than cash, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are still private. Dell will become a publicly traded stock as a result of the deal. DVMT will be acquired at a premium in line with standard transactions, the people said. The transaction will give Dell Technologies more direct control over VMware's fate. VMware is more than 80 percent controlled by holders of the Dell tracking stock (Dell's Class V shares) and Dell's DHI shareholders (Michael Dell and Silver Lake). Upon completion of the deal, Dell Technologies will assume that control directly over VMware. That could lead Dell to pursue a merger with VMware down the road, said the people. In that sense, a deal for DVMT could be seen as step one in a two-step deal, the people said. Dell's initial plan to roll up into VMware couldn't be done at this time because of resistance from VMware's board and special committee, the people said. VMware will pay a $9 billion dividend to DVMT holders as part of the deal announcement, said the people. Dell will use proceeds from the dividend to pay out its tracker holders. DVMT holders will get a shareholder vote on the deal, the people said. Dell considered several other transactions since January, including going public and pursuing a reverse merger with VMware. Dell has wanted to simplify its capital structure, give its private holders a publicly traded currency and increase its ownership of VMware. Back in May, Dell hinted at a stock deal with owners of DVMT, which has a market capitalization of about $17 billion. A Dell spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment. A VMware spokesman declined to comment.

On Sunday, Richard Allison, currently president of international business for Domino's, will take over as CEO, leaving some investors wondering about the company's continued growth prospects. In the eight years Doyle has been chief executive, the company's stock has risen nearly 2,000 percent. Domino's overall market share in the pizza category went from 9.7 percent in 2010 to 16.4 percent in 2017, according to analysts at BTIG. The company's market share in the pizza delivery category has also increased by about 10 percent since 2008. In April, Domino's beat earning estimates by nearly $100 million, causing its shares to surge by more than 7 percent.

Meanwhile, customers can now order from approximately 200,000 Hotspots, or nontraditional locales such as beaches and sports stadiums. That means pizza lovers and convenience-seeking consumers alike can request their Domino's meal from a park bench or a bus stop, among other locations, without ever having to talk to another human being. \"It's our path to being a 100 percent digital company,\" Allison told CNBC's Jim Cramer in April.

The company currently has more than 14,000 shops internationally and sells more than 2 million pizzas each day, or about 1 in 6 pizzas in the U.S. \"I think they could look at and have an opportunity to expand into the personalized pizza market,\" DiFrisco said. \"You\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in the quick-casual pizza segment.

However, there is a \u201cbig wild card\u201d he\u2019s concerned about: a possible trade war, which he called a \u201close-lose proposition.\u201d The first half of the year was marked by volatility. In late January, the major indexes reached all-time highs but they then fell on concerns over rising interest rates. Strong earnings helped equities turn around, but then tensions over trade knocked stocks down again. On Friday, the last day of trading for the first half, stocks traded higher but were still headed for weekly losses. In fact, investors bailed out of U.S. stocks at a record pace in the last week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Outflows from U.S. stock funds and ETFs totaled $24.2 billion, the third-highest ever and the highest since the February market correction, the bank said. Katz said investors are worried about a trade war but pointed out that fundamentals are good. \u201cIf you have a change in sentiment, that money that\u2019s going out of the market can easily flow back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not going out because there\u2019s structural problems with the market or that there are better places to put money.\u201d Eric Marshall, director of research and portfolio manager at Hodges Funds, says there are opportunities to be found regardless of what happens with trade. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a pullback here over the last couple weeks, and we think that really creates opportunities if you really know what you own and you really focus in on individual company fundamentals,\u201d he said on \u201cPower Lunch.\u201d He also anticipates the market will be higher by the end of the year, thanks to continued improvement in corporate earnings. Marshall particularly likes recreation product manufacturer Brunswick, which he said has a lot of hidden value, and construction material maker Eagle Materials, which he likes for its strong earnings outlook. Katz is bullish on financials and is hoping the latest Federal Reserve stress test results are the catalyst for a rally. \u201cThis is a good environment for the banking group \u2026 yet the stocks are selling at very reasonable valuations,\u201d he said. Katz expects banks to be a leader and \u201ca lot higher\u201d six to 12 months from now. He also says industrials should see a turnaround, but he's still wary on utilities and real estate investment trusts. Technology still looks like a good place to be, he says, but he likes more modestly priced stocks over the high flyers. His top stock picks are J.P. Morgan Chase, Eaton, Qualcomm and Schlumberger. \u2014 CNBC's Fred Imbert, Brenda Hentschel and Patti Domm contributed to this report. Disclosures: Matrix clients and Katz own J.P.

The company\u2019s stock is up nearly 2,000 percent from its $17 per share initial public offering, which was held eight years ago on June 29, 2010. The stock market is rewarding companies that have a believable narrative on how to survive in a rapidly changing world versus focusing on near-term profit streams. Companies' current earnings are of little consequence, if their businesses get crushed by tech juggernauts like Amazon or Netflix in a few years. Only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 have outperformed Tesla since its IPO. Telsa\u2019s stock performance is all the more impressive given the company has never made money on an annual basis. The company lost nearly $2 billion last year and burned about $3.4 billion in cash after capital investments. Investors are betting that Musk\u2019s company will disrupt the entire auto industry and gain significant market share as the world moves toward electric cars. show chapters Tesla went public eight years ago today. Here's how the company has changed 1:15 PM ET Fri, 29 June 2018 | 01:19 Even if Tesla misses its target to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars per week around the end of the second quarter and its shares drop dramatically early next week on a disappointing data release, the stock will likely still be up significantly since its IPO. On Thursday Reuters reported Tesla is not producing enough Model 3s per shift to meet its target, according to workers at its main plant in Fremont, California. In similar fashion, another technology visionary, Reed Hastings, has led Netflix to stunning equity returns with minimal profitability. Investors believe Netflix will succeed globally and eventually be able to raise its prices. Last year billionaire John Malone explained why he believes Netflix will dominate the future. He was not dismayed by Netflix's guidance of up to $8 billion in content spending for 2018 at the time and multibillion-dollar cash burn. In fact he said the company's massive investments are essential for its success. The internet \"makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,\" Malone said at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting in November. To be sure, profits can still matter. Two solidly profitable health-care-related companies comprised two of the four top S&P 500 performers. Artificial heart maker Abiomed was the No. 1 performer in the time period with a 4,107 percent return, while Align Technology\u2019s stock rose nearly 2,200 percent.

But those plans won\u2019t include starting a separate fund, according to a top executive. \u201cWe're not planning to do it,\u201d Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures told CNBC. \u201cWe see a lot of upside to keeping it under the same roof.\u201d The New York- based venture capital firm, named after its 19th-floor office on Broadway just blocks from Union Square, has announced a number of crypto investments, including well-known U.S. exchange Coinbase. Wenger said those companies can learn from non-blockchain companies, and vice versa. On Monday, competing venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced its first-ever fund dedicated to crypto companies. Executives told CNBC that it\u2019s an \u201call-weather\u201d fund that they plan to invest over time, regardless of market conditions. Union Square Ventures, like its West-coast peer, is taking a long-term view of the space despite worsening bear market in cryptocurrency. The firm is focusing investments on what Wenger called the \u201cfoundational plumbing\u201d stage. For the most part, it's putting money in the technology supporting applications, instead of the apps or use cases themselves. \u201cInvestors are rationally pouring a lot of money into this sector, because I think people are seeing the winning blockchain here might be worth a trillion, or a couple of trillion dollars,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all crazy to think that.\u201d Wenger echoed Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said this week that blockchain could be a bubble, with companies going belly-up at the same rate as the dot-com era. But he said that risk could pay off for investors who get in early, and spread their bets. \u201cCertainly, for any one particular project there's an extremely high chance it won't work,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cAs a result, if it works, the rewards will be very high.\u201d ICO flops The shakeout at least for initial coin offerings, or ICOs, has already begun. More than 1,000 crypto projects that raised money through an ICO have failed this year, according to website Coinopsy. Those failed coins and multiple scams, which caught the attention of regulators this year, have cast a cloud on the entire industry, Wenger said. \u201cYou've had a series of ICOs where investors have purchased at steep discounts \u2014 the second it starts trading those investors cash out, they make a handsome return, and someone else is left to hold the bag,\u201d he said. While Wenger said token offerings are an \"innovative new financing mechanism,\" he maintained that the method isn't right for every blockchain project, just like a public stock offering isn't right for every company. ICOs raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to research firm Autonomous Next. A Cayman Islands start-up notably raised $4 billion, eclipsing the world's biggest initial public offerings on stock exchanges this year. But the total a project raises might not really matter, according to Wenger. \"The amount you've raised in an ICO or in a traditional way in this space is not going to turn out to be a great predictor of success,\" he said. \"Very interesting projects are also being pulled off on a lot, lot, lot less money.\" Bitcoin Wenger, who holds a Ph.D. in information technology from MIT, personally owns bitcoin but says he is acutely aware of the risks to retail investors. The cryptocurrency, which Union Square Ventures also invested in, has fallen nearly 60 percent this year after a meteoric rise to nearly $20,000 last year. \u201cI don't think you should be in the space and say 'I'm only going to hold bitcoin,'\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, this whole space is a high risk space, and I don\u2019t think anybody should be investing all of their life savings.\u201d As far as the entire sector failing, Wenger said there's a chance but it's \"a pretty small chance.\" \u201cThe stuff that actually works will float to the top,\" he said. \"It might take a while, but time will tell.\u201d ", "author": "Clodagh Kilcoyne | Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/union-square-ventures-is-doubling-down-on-crypto.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Clodagh Kilcoyne", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Albert Wenger", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Union Square Ventures Union Square Ventures", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "trillion-dollar", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "10 years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Albert Wenger", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Union Square Ventures", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "19th", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Broadway", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Union Square", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Coinbase", "category": "EVENT"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Andreessen Horowitz", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Union Square Ventures", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "West-coast", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a couple of trillion dollars", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Apple", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Steve Wozniak", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "More than 1,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Coinopsy", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$6.6 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$9.1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Autonomous Next", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "A Cayman Islands", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$4 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ICO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bitcoin Wenger", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Ph.D.", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "MIT", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Union Square Ventures", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "nearly 60 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "nearly $20,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wenger", "category": "ORG"}], "description": "Union Square Ventures is betting big on crypto but its strategy won\u2019t include launching a separate fund, according to a top executive.", "title": "Union Square Ventures is investing in crypto for the long haul, but won\u2019t start a dedicated fund", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/29/105303674-1530296622572gettyimages-495851792.jpeg?v=1530296767"}, {"time": "2018-06-29T13:34:00-0400", "body": " show chapters Personal spending up 0.2% vs. 0.4% est. 9:07 AM ET Fri, 29 June 2018 | 01:32 For 10 years, the Federal Reserve has stalked its prey \u2014 inflation \u2014 but has mostly come up empty. Now that it has caught up to its goal, the question is what will happen next, and the answer isn't obvious. Core personal consumption expenditures, the central bank's preferred inflation gauge, rose to 2 percent in May, matching the Fed's long-run target. That's the first time that has happened since a five-month period that ended in April 2012, and marks a possible milestone in the effort to normalize policy from its extreme crisis-era accommodation. On the surface, the climb to 2 percent would indicate a clear path for the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee to continue on its trajectory of slow, steady rate hikes. However, the calculus will remain difficult for officials as they seek to divine whether the economy is on the cusp of breaking out, or on the road to recession. \"They're going to likely continue to raise rates and lower the balance sheet,\" said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. \"That seems to be their M.O., which is a mistake.\" FOMC members indicated at their meeting earlier in June that they were likely to increase rates twice more in 2018 \u2014 in September and December \u2014 and three more times in 2019. That comes amid an operation to shrink the size of the bond portfolio the Fed keeps on its $4.4 trillion balance sheet. LaVorgna favors the balance sheet reduction but thinks the Fed should slow down on the rate increases. Markets have been restless with the ramped-up schedule of rate hikes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 4 percent since the June 12-13 FOMC meeting. At the same time, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has fallen from near 3 percent to about 2.84 percent, while the two-year yield has edged higher to 2.53 percent, sparking worries that the two might invert and trigger what has been a classic recession signal. Getty Images Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill February 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. \"If the Fed goes two more times this year ... the yield curve inverts, certainly by early Q4,\" LaVorgna said. \"If that's the case, you want to be on the lookout for recession as early as Q4 of 2019\" as there is typically a lag time of five quarters from when the curve inverts to when an actual recession takes hold. The threat of the Fed tightening the economy into contraction could be at the root of why the market doesn't quite believe that the central bank will be as aggressive as it is indicating. Despite an upward shift in the \"dot plot\" of individual committee members' expectations for rates and Chairman Jerome Powell's explicit statements that further rate hikes are warranted, the market is only pricing in one more increase this year. The fed funds futures market, where traders make bets on the central bank's benchmark rate, is indicating just a 45 percent chance of a December increase, according to the CME's FedWatch tracking tool. In fact, the indicator is showing a 10 percent chance of a rate cut at the meeting that would negate the September increase. The Fed has hiked rates twice this year, most recently at the June meeting, and the current target is at 1.75 percent to 2 percent. Even with inflation at 2 percent, \"monetary policymakers cannot rest easy,\" Gus Faucher, PNC chief economist, said in a note. \"Inflation was briefly at the goal about five years ago, but then moved stubbornly below it.\" The Fed believes 2 percent inflation is a level at which the economy is running at a sustainable growth rate. But the Fed has struggled over the past six years to meet its prices goal even as employment \u2014 the other part of the Fed's statutory dual mandate \u2014 has surged. The unemployment rate is now at 3.8 percent, tied for the lowest since late 1969. Lack of wage pressures has stymied economists at the Fed and on Wall Street, though many predict that a tighter labor market eventually will push pay higher and justify the Fed's intentions. \"The Fed is projecting that core inflation will not rise further from here, but we suspect that core inflation will continue to trend higher, as capacity constraints begin to bite,\" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. \"That will keep the pressure on the Fed to keep hiking rates once a quarter over the coming year or so.\" The pace of economic growth, though, remains an open question. While the Trump administration has been touting potential GDP gains of 3 percent or more, the first quarter of 2018 came in at just 2 percent, and the Atlanta Fed on Friday slashed its second-quarter projection to 3.8 percent from 4.5 percent. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said the Fed won't be able to meet its aggressive forecasts, but still will be able to keep raising rates. \"People are comfortable with the notion that the U.S. will outpace other countries, that U.S. growth is solid, that the major risk for U.S. growth is external and not internal and that the Fed will continue with its 'beautiful normalization,'\" El-Erian told CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" using a term he has coined for the central bank's process. \"I think we get three, not four, rate hikes this year, and I think the Fed is on a good course.\" ", "author": "Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/the-fed-has-met-its-inflation-target-now-what.html", "keywords": [{"term": "0.2%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term":

Despite Apple\u2019s recent underperformance on Wall Street, one analyst believes there are no less than five reasons why investors should buy shares of the iPhone maker. Highlighting the company\u2019s 2018 product lineup as well as healthy services revenue, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva told clients that news of sluggish demand should subside throughout the summer months. Demand \u201cis estimated to pick up during back to school/holiday quarter and production cuts typically precede new model launches in the fall,\u201d Suva wrote Monday. \u201cWe remain positive on growth opportunities via Applewood (growth in Services coupled with emerging market growth especially in India). Apple shares remain attractively valued.\u201d The analyst reiterated his buy rating on shares of the Cupertino, California-based company as well as his $200 price target, implying 8 percent upside over the next year. Apple\u2019s stock is down 2.7 percent over the past month, underperforming the S&P 500, but up more than 9 percent since January. Here are Suva\u2019s five reasons to buy Apple stock right now. 1) Promising 2018 product lineup \"While iPhone X demand expectations have been tempered, we believe 2H18 lineup could spur demand given the differentiation in the higher end OLED models versus the LCD models and consumers becoming accustomed to paying a premium price for smartphones which are essential to daily life. We are not expecting a Super Cycle but we do believe sustainable single-digit unit growth of iPhone is achievable.\" 2) Capital returns \"An incremental $100 billion share repurchases program compares to Apple's current buyback plan of $210 billion and average buybacks of $32 billion/year over the past five years. Assuming Apple executes this over a two year period, this would essentially remove an incremental 550 million shares over the two-year period (or 250 million shares per year), resulting in an approximate 12 percent share reduction over the next two years.\" That capital return, Suva notes, could drive 10 percent earnings per share accretion. 3) Rising service revenue, AppleCare+, Apple Music and App Store Growth \"Apple Services in total represent about 15 percent of total company sales and is the second largest contributor to margin dollars ... We note Apple's internal goal is to double Service revenues from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020 seems reasonable.\" \"Underpinning Service growth projections is the growth in paid subscriptions (Apple Music, iCloud, paid subscription content such as games, videos, magazines/newspapers, AppleCare+, etc.) which we believe is approaching close to 270 million. This compares with Apple's disclosed active installed base of 1.3 billion devices.\" 4) Enterprise push midterm and Applewood (aka India and emerging markets) \"Enterprise remains an area of opportunity for Apple. More recently at IBM Think 2018, Apple and IBM revealed an enhancement to their existing collaboration with Watson Services for Core ML and the newly designed IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple. The offering combined Apple\u2019s Core ML tools for developers with IBM\u2019s Watson to make it easier for companies to add artificial intelligence into mobile applications.\" \"We view Applewood is an opportunity to drive both sales and EPS growth. This is important as many believe Apple has saturated its addressable market especially considering it's a premium product company that everyone cannot afford.\" 5) Attractive valuation relative to prior cycles \"On a price to earnings basis, Apple shares trade at 0.9x PE relative to the S&P 500. This compares with a low of 0.6x (during the past four years) and as high as 0.95x. Excluding their net cash per share which is about 20 percent of their current market cap, current relative multiples are hovering around ~0.8x. As Service revenues accelerate and total addressable market expansion in India and China returns to growth, we could see some acceleration in relative PE multiples.\" Disclaimer ", "author": "Justin

The second half of 2018 will be tough for investors as they grapple with rising trade tensions and higher interest rates, according to Goldman Sachs. However, companies with strong balance sheets like Facebook and NVIDIA should do well in the tough times ahead as they can better deal with higher borrowing costs and overall volatility. Equities posted a mixed performance to start off the year, as the enthusiasm over strong economic data and solid earnings growth was dampened by worries about an impending trade war between the U.S. and its key partners. This, along with the prospects of higher rates, sets up investors for a potentially rough second half. \u201cWhile trade tensions have fluctuated for much of 2018, the situation has escalated during the last month. The White House recently proposed new tariffs on auto imports totaling $275 bn and tariffs targeting Chinese imports worth $400 bn,\u201d David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note Friday. Equities felt the bite of rising trade tensions again on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 100 points to start off the second half. The Dow declined 1.8 percent in the first six months of the year, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 8.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. Stocks also fell into correction territory earlier in the year, pushing the major indexes off record highs, on concerns of rising interest rates. show chapters Financial sector snaps 13-day losing streak 1:06 PM ET Fri, 29 June 2018 | 04:42 \u201cRising interest rates and escalating trade tensions have contributed to an increase in equity volatility in 2018,\u201d Kostin said. The \u201c10-year US Treasury yields have risen by 44 bp YTD to 2.85%, and our economists expect they will continue to rise to 3.25% by year-end 2018.\u201d The 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly to 2.855 percent on Monday. The Federal Reserve has already raised rates twice this year, and investors are expecting at least one more rate hike before year-end. However, Kostin said the Fed could tighten monetary policy a lot faster than the market expects through 2019. \u201cThe fed funds futures market is pricing just 3 additional rate hikes through the end of 2019 compared with our economists\u2019 expectation for 6 hikes,\u201d he said. Kostin said stocks including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Intuitive Surgical, Facebook and NVIDIA should do well in the second half, however, given their strong balance sheets can withstand higher borrowing costs. These stocks have all outperformed the S&P 500 this year, rising at least 10 percent. Goldman uses a metric called the Altman Z-Score to determine the strength of a company's balance sheet. The score takes into account five ratios: working capital to assets, retained earnings to assets, earnings before interest and taxes to assets, sales to assets and market cap to liabilities. The higher the score, the stronger the company's balance sheet. \u201cThematically, strong balance sheet stocks have outperformed this year as short- and long-term interest rates have risen,\u201d Kostin noted. \u201cWe expect strong balance sheet stocks will continue to outperform given record-high net leverage for the median S&P 500 stock and tightening financial conditions.\u201d WATCH: Retail analyst on the second half of year show chapters Apparel and footwear most exposed from tariffs, says retail analyst 6:51 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 02:46 ", "author": "Getty Images", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/goldman-the-second-half-is-going-to-be-difficult-but-these-stocks-wit.html", "keywords": [{"term": "the New York Stock Exchange", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York City", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The second half of 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "NVIDIA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "The White House", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "275", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "400", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "David Kostin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Goldman Sachs", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 100", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the second half", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dow", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the first six months of the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Nasdaq", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "1.7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "earlier in the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "13-day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1:06 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "29", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "04:42 \u201cRising", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kostin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "10-year", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "US Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "44", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "YTD", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2.85%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "3.25%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "year-end 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "10-year", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2.855 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "The Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "at least one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "year-end", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kostin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the end of 2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "6", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Kostin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Chipotle Mexican Grill", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Intuitive Surgical", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "NVIDIA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the second half", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "at least 10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Goldman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Altman Z-Score", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "five", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kostin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the second half of year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Apparel", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "6:51 AM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "2 July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "02:46", "category": "CARDINAL"}], "description": "The second half of 2018 will be tough for investors as they grapple with rising trade tensions and higher interest rates, according to Goldman Sachs.

In the past two weeks, South Korean exchanges Coinrail and Bithumb have both announced major cryptocurrency hacks. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-PSeBv\"),window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"PSeBv\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"PSeBv\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM, said Friday\u2019s wild trading was partly exacerbated by CME futures contracts expiring. But sentiment has also been sour. \u201cThe market is not reacting to any positive news, but the news flow has been quite positive,\u201d Kelly said. Among recent positive headlines Kelly mentioned was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent clarification that it does not classify ethereum as a security. Matthew Newton, analyst at eToro, said it's not uncommon for bitcoin prices to dip around the futures settlement date. Otherwise, he pointed to a lack of excitement and volume in cryptocurrency markets. \"There\u2019s no real spark in the market right now to get it moving, it\u2019s just more sellers than buyers,\" Newton said. \"It needs something to get markets back to life, like some development on the technology or regulatory side.\" Other top cryptocurrencies have struggled this week. Ethereum is down about 13 percent for the week, while XRP dropped 14 percent. Litecoin fell 14 percent this week, and bitcoin cash is down 16 percent. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 61 percent this year, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Even with Thursday's drop, Tesla shares have only lost about 8 percent over the past 12 months in the face of repeated production problems surrounding the electric car maker's new less-expensive Model 3 sedan.

Musk called Sacconaghi's question about gross margins \"boring\" and \"boneheaded.\" Cramer, the host of \"Mad Money,\" said the Bernstein analyst is asking the right, tough questions of Tesla. Musk on Thursday sounded off on Twitter at media organizations Reuters, Business Insider and CNBC. Musk accused both Reuters and Business Insider of publishing false or misleading stories. He also suggested CNBC features analysts with poor prediction records.

Shares of the electric car company's stock were just $17 when it began trading on the Nasdaq on June 29, 2010, compared with around $345 on Friday. The only problem: The company has never made money on an annual basis. The company lost nearly $2 billion last year and burned about $3.4 billion in cash after capital investments. But Albertine said investors like CEO Elon Musk because he's seen as an innovator and Tesla has had \"significantly more demand than any other auto manufacturer has had on Earth, in terms of reservations for a vehicle.\" Trip Chowdhry, managing director of equity research at Global Equities Research, pointed out that Tesla's revenues this year will be in the range of $20 billion. \"People are buying Model 3\u2019s without even test driving [them],\" Chowdhry said Friday on \"Closing Bell.\" \"When did you see any product people are buying, which is worth more than $50,000, without touching, without feeling, without driving? And not only that, this $20 billion revenue has been generated by zero advertisement dollars. This is the power behind Tesla. No other company anywhere on the planet comes even close.\" Still, Tesla's growth efforts face many obstacles, including the need for more factories and expanded product lines. Albertine said Musk will likely invest in factories in China in an effort to move in to the Asian market. Getty Images Elon Musk Wall Street analyst Gordon Johnson warned investors to not be \"an enthusiast about a man. You have to look at the numbers,\" he said Friday on \"Closing Bell.\" He pointed out that in addition to $3.4 billion the company burned through last year, they also spent about a billion dollars last quarter. \"I\u2019m not that hot on Tesla\u2019s future,\" Gordon said. \"And quite frankly, we find it kind of ridiculous.\" \"You have to look at cash flow,\" he said. \"You have to look at their ability to compete. You're basing everything on belief in a man.\" \"The point is, do they make cash? Do they make money on cars produced? The answer is no,\" Gordon said. Meanwhile, Tesla has set a target to produce 5,000 Model 3's a week by the end of the second quarter. Reuters released a report on Thursday saying the company is not producing enough Model 3s per shift to meet this target. \"I don\u2019t think if they make the number then the bulls have been vindicated and the bears are going to go away,\" said Albertine, who also serves as managing partner at Consumer Edge, a financial research firm. \"If they miss it, it will be a turbulent month or so until we get more details from the second-quarter results in early August.\" \"I think what they\u2019re going to have to show at some point is that they\u2019re profitable with the 3 at 5,000-plus units per week,\" he said. \"I think we\u2019re going to get that glimpse sometime in the next couple of quarters.\" \u2014 CNBC's Tae Kim contributed to this report.

Quantifying just how much damage an entrenched trade battle could wreak upon the international community is a trickier task, but J.P. Morgan has come up with three scenarios. In J.P. Morgan's first model, the U.S. is assumed to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 percentage points, with no retaliation. In the second, the U.S. action is met in equal fashion, with other countries that are the targets of U.S. tariffs imposing a 10-percentage-point increase in tariffs on imports from the U.S. In the third scenario, the entire world raises tariffs by 10 percentage points, a phenomenon J.P. Morgan calls a trade war. John Normand, the bank's head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, said he believes that the third, worst-case scenario could reduce global growth by a \u201cmaterial\u201d amount of at least 1.4 percent over the next two years. Source: J.P. Morgan \u201cOur economists acknowledge that such frameworks underestimate the likely damage that comes through disrupted supply chains, plus the feedback loops from tighter financial conditions,\u201d Normand said in a note to clients last week. \u201cPolicy uncertainty has a habit of denting consumer and business confidence, which in turn lowers household and corporate spending. The team\u2019s proprietary, composite measure of developed market business sentiment already shows such a drop, but from above-average levels due to U.S. tax stimulus.\u201d Though Normand acknowledged that those worst-case fears have yet to materialize, the J.P. Morgan researchers added that global growth could slow by about 0.4 percent if countries targeted by the United States respond by slapping equivalent tariffs on Washington. show chapters White House: Trump's tariffs aim to create a fair playing field 5:08 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 01:07 That scenario appears more like the one President Donald Trump finds himself stuck in after Canada started collecting duties on a variety of U.S. products on Sunday, including orange juice, yogurt, and whiskey. The Canadians will be reinforced by Mexico and China later this week in responding to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs when the two countries take aim at the U.S. pork and soybean industries. Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s initial duties worth $3.2 billion took effect June 22. The majority are duties of 25 percent and include a slew of U.S. products, including motorcycles, boats, whiskey and peanut butter. The three U.S. allies declared the new tariffs in direct response to the Trump administration's choice to levy imported steel and aluminum products. A cornerstone of Trump\u2019s campaign, the U.S.-centric philosophy remains key to the president\u2019s economic program in office. Trump has for months used his pulpit and economic tariffs to try to effect change in trade deals the administration deems unfair and ultimately harmful to American economic interests. Calling for \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade relationships, Trump has promised to dissolve the new U.S. tariffs only after more favorable deals are struck with trading allies. tweet Trump's battle for more balanced trade could end up helping the economy. The trade deficit appears to be on the decline, falling to a seven-month low in April, according to the Commerce Department. The trade gap dropped 2.1 percent to $46.2 billion, the smallest since September. If the trend continues, trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the second quarter, buoyed by strength in the manufacturing sector and consumer spending. The warning from J.P. Morgan\u2019s Normand, however, represents just the latest iteration in a string of cautious notes from the bank's analysts in recent months detailing the possible dangers of \u201cTrumponomics.\u201d Marko Kolanovic, the bank\u2019s head of quantitative strategy, estimated in June that the Trump\u2019s tough trade tactics have caused the destruction of more than $1 trillion in market value. \"By attributing the trade-related news flow (positive or negative) to the performance of the U.S. market, we estimated the impact on U.S. equities to be negative 4.5 percent\" since March, Kolanovic said in his June note. \"Taking the current market capitalization, this translates into $1.25 trillion of value destruction for U.S. companies. For a comparison, this is about two-thirds of the value of total fiscal stimulus.\" Kolanovic, who heads J.P. Morgan's global quantitative and derivatives strategy, predicted the stock market correction earlier this year and highlighted complacency and high leverage in the market as warning signs. Further, the strategist highlighted the impact of trade and protectionist ideology as \"significant\" market headwinds. \"A negotiation strategy that includes bluffing/threats can be successful in a two-party negotiation setup, but is more likely to deliver self-defeating results in a complex system such as global trade,\" he said. \"The value destroyed by a trade war might be reversible if policies are reversed, while the positive impact of fiscal measures is likely to remain. This would likely catalyze a rough 4 percent market rally.\" WATCH: Who loses from the ketchup tariff show chapters Canada's ketchup tariff will hurt food service businesses the most: Analyst 5:06 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:43 Disclaimer ", "author": "Getty Images ", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/what-a-full-out-trade-war-would-cost-the-global-economy.html", "keywords": [{"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "J.P.

Tesla said on Monday that the carmaker reached its one-week production goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars for the last week of the June quarter. But the company fell short on its second-quarter deliveries by posting 40,740 vehicles delivered versus the Wall Street consensus of approximately 51,000. \u201cAfter Herculean efforts and albeit a few hours after a self-imposed deadline, Tesla finally achieved its latest goal to reach production of 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week.

Some members expressed \u201cconcern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn,\u201d the meeting summary released Thursday stated. As a result, almost all officials at the central bank believe they should continue to raise interest rates on a regular basis. That comes even amid substantial worry that current tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners could stall the growth the economy has seen this year. Fed business contacts \u201cexpressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity.\u201d Moreover, they indicated \u201ccapital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.\u201d Those concerns, however, did not stop the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee from approving another quarter-point hike to the benchmark overnight borrowing rate. The funds rate moved to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, the seventh such increase since December 2015. 'Progressing smoothly' The move came amid an economy expected to grow by about 4 percent in the second quarter amid high levels of consumer and business sentiment and increasing levels of investment. Economic growth is \u201cprogressing smoothly\u201d the minutes stated, with activity \u201cexpanding at a solid rate,\u201d and \u201clabor market conditions continuing to strengthen.\u201d Inflation is hovering around the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation goal, the minutes also said. \u201cAlmost all participants\u201d thought the rate hike was appropriate. Committee members even approved removing a long-standing clause known as \u201cforward guidance,\u201d stating that the fund rate would remain \u201cbelow levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d In fact, officials said that if the current course continues, the rate actually could be above what they consider \u201cneutral\u201d by next year. Maintaining forward guidance \u201cwas no longer appropriate in light of the strong state of the economy and the current expected path for policy.\u201d Still, there were plenty of worries expressed at the meeting. Trade was a hot topic as the White House prepares to levy a series of tariffs that will take effect Friday. \u201cMost participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,\u201d the minutes stated. Members saw fiscal policy \u2013 last year\u2019s tax cuts as well as increased spending plans \u2013 as \u201csupportive of economic growth\u201d and posing \u201cupside risks,\u201d though a few worried that it is unsustainable. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the U.S. will be running a $1 trillion deficit by 2020, posing worries that debt will stymie economic growth. Fed officials also expressed some worry about conditions overseas. \u201cMany participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe and some\u201d emerging market economies. The jobs market and its 3.8 percent unemployment rate also came under some scrutiny. Members noted what has now become a frequently mentioned economic concern, namely the difficulty employers are experiencing in finding qualified workers to fill job openings. Business owners in some cases were increasing salaries and benefits to retain workers while others were offering training or turning to automation in lieu of searching for new workers. However, members noted that wage pressures remain \u201cmoderate\u201d though they expect wage inflation to pick up soon.

In news first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Facebook handed a 747-page document to U.S. lawmakers released late Friday. In that cache of information, Facebook said it granted 61 companies like AOL, Nike, UPS and dating app Hinge a \"one-time\" six-month extension to comply with its policy changes on user data.

I'll buy them out.\" Dell Technologies announced Monday it will buy out the holders of shares that track the performance of VMware using a mix of cash and equity in Dell. The move means Dell will again trade on the stock market, about five years after the private equity firm Silver Lake and Michael Dell teamed up on a $24.9 billion deal to take the technology company private. \"In the last five years a lot has changed. We've completely transformed the business, become the essential infrastructure company, really changed the profile nature of the company in terms of our capabilities,\" Dell said. \"This was about simplifying our capital structure and exposing the value that we've created to shareholders.\" Silver Lake owns about 18 percent of the company. The tracking stock was introduced in 2016 to help Dell pay for its $67 billion purchase of EMC Corp. The new security was linked to part of EMC's interest in VMware, and the rest is publicly traded along with the tracking stock. Dell has been conducting a strategic review for several months as it has sought to consolidate its complicated ownership structure without overburdening its balance sheet, which bears around $50 billion in debt. Dell said it will propose to exchange each share of VMware tracking stock for 1.3665 shares of Dell Technologies Class C common stock, or at the holder's election, $109 in cash, subject to the total amount of cash consideration not above $9 billion. The transaction represents a premium of 28.9 percent to Dell's closing price on Friday. \"There is a technology led boom in investment that requires modern IT infrastructure, and Dell Technologies is the lead infrastructure company on the planet,\" Dell said. \"We've capture the hearts and minds of the decision-makers.\" show chapters Michael Dell says he is 'optimistic' about the world business economy 11:04 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:27 Shares of VMware rose nearly 10 percent.

After the deal, VMware shareholders would own between 20.8 percent to 31 percent of Dell, depending on how many investors opt for cash, Dell said. Dell considered several other transactions since January, including going public and pursuing a reverse merger with VMware. Dell has wanted to simplify its capital structure, give its private holders a publicly traded currency and increase its ownership of VMware.

Each year, more than 200,000 U.S. military veterans return to civilian life after serving our country in uniform. According to the Small Business Administration, 10 percent of veterans would like to own their own business. Veterans are disciplined, well-trained leaders. With access to capital and business training, their success rates as small business owners are high. This contributes to local economic activity and job creation. Veterans can struggle to find capital they need to get their businesses going. In fact, more than 75 percent of veterans reported encountering challenges as they started and looked to grow their business, citing access to capital as a top challenge, according to an Institute for Veterans and Military Families study. Just about 8 percent of veterans used business loans from banks or other commercial lenders, yet veteran-owned business account for nearly 10 percent of all U.S business and generate about $1.1 trillion in sales each year. Providing access to capital is where America\u2019s banks can do even more to help the men and women who served the country and now want to help drive the economy. That's why Bank of America recently launched a new $20 million Veteran Entrepreneur Lending Program, to connect prospective veteran business owners with affordable capital to help start and grow their businesses. We are working closely with community development financial institutions in local communities across the country to identify and support veteran-owned businesses. And before receiving a loan, veteran borrowers can participate in a two-month training program \u2013 led by Syracuse University, Oklahoma State University and the non-profit VetToCEO \u2013 to help them stay on track in those crucial early years of starting a business. We know that this is just one way to help, and the success stories are there. Two years ago, Marc Smith, an Army veteran and owner of the Patriotic Pig BBQ in Texas, needed early capital to grow his business. Marc received a loan from a community development financial institution that was, in his words, a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d It allowed Marc to buy a large military-themed smoker, which helped him serve four times as many customers and, with the help of ten employees, cater five events per day. His business took off. In 2017, after 22 years in the military, Marcus Flake, Sr., wanted to apply his Master\u2019s Degree in public health and help fellow veterans. With the help of a bank loan, he started a business that does both. Commercial Sanitation Initiative (CSI) U.S. Military Maintenance provides sanitation, maintenance and remodeling services and works to create workforce development programs for veterans. Today, there are more than 2.5 million U.S. businesses like these that are majority-owned by veterans. Of those, more than 440,000 are also employers, creating economic growth and jobs. Veterans know how to lead and have a unique ability to influence change. We can all do more to contribute to their success. It\u2019s one more way to serve those who have served our country.

The coin was priced around $5,900 Friday 5 p.m. ET, a steep decline from the December 2017 highs of around $19,500. Bitcoin is down 57 percent in 2018.

But Hayes pointed out that bitcoin's volatile nature \u2014 and the possibility of large gains \u2014is what makes it so attractive to investors. \"We\u2019ve done these kind of moves before,\" he said. With more people in the market comes more capital and the potential for faster jumps in price, Hayes added. \"Now that we have more visibility, more people talking about [bitcoin], the time between an aggressive bear market and an aggressive bull market, I think, is going to shorten,\" he said.

Not really focused upon as much is an offhand remark made by Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, in a recent television interview. Mr. Kudlow suggested that he hoped that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates very slowly. While one might agree or disagree with Mr. Kudlow\u2019s remark (I agree), what is of greater interest is that he made the statement. It breaks a precedent that presidents \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 have followed for more than two and half decades \u2013 i.e., the independence of the Federal Reserve would be respected. Mr. Kudlow understands that he is changing policy. What\u2019s more, he undoubtedly understands that the While House can, and I believe will, take total control of the Federal Reserve. It is very possible that monetary policy will become a political, not an economic or financial decision. Brief history History indicates that while the modern White Houses have not tread on the Fed, prior presidents always did so. Harry Truman fought so hard to force Marriner Eccles (then Fed chairman) to keep interest rates pegged at low levels that there had to be a meeting between the Treasury Department and the Fed to mediate the dispute. Truman ultimately lost. Lyndon Johnson was outraged that William McChesney Martin would raise rates as his Great Society initiative would take place. Johnson also lost as Martin took his \u201cpunch bowl away\u201d and raised rates. Jimmy Carter could do nothing as Paul Volcker may have cost Carter his presidency by driving rates so high that the nation suffered back-to-back recessions. Ronald Reagan and his Treasury Secretary James Baker did everything possible to get rid of Volcker. They ultimately had the support of the international financial community and Volcker was not reappointed. Richard Nixon had greatest success in his short confrontation with the Fed. According to the Nixon tapes and the view of most observers then and now, Nixon bent Arthur Burns to the President\u2019s will and easy monetary policies were put in place. Ultimately, when Burns decided to leave the Fed, G. William Miller took his position, but lasted less than two years due to what was considered to be his political leanings. Cake walk A look at today\u2019s Federal Reserve indicates that President Trump might have little resistance to gaining total control of the organization. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is supposed to have 7 members. It has three. Two of the three have their current positions because they were nominated by the President and approved by the Senate. The President can now nominate 4 more people to the Board. If at least two of these nominees make it through the Senate confirmation hearings, the President will have a durable majority on the Board. What will the president want? Understanding what the President wants from the Fed is not hard. He will want low interest rates for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Higher interest rates place tremendous strain on the Federal budget with its $20 trillion in debt. Higher rates theoretically can reduce economic growth. The President wants the stock market to continue to rise as a tangible indicator of the success of his economic programs.The Fed has just raised interest rates 7 times and it is being speculated that there could be 5 more increases. It is shrinking the agency\u2019s balance sheet and this is one key factor in the slowdown in money supply growth to 4.0 percent year-over-year or the lowest in 25 years. History argues that after 12 interest rate increases, a possible inverted yield curve, and very weak money supply growth, the stock market will not rise. Finally, it is unlikely that the President will fear higher levels of inflation. High inflation may be the only way to pay down the budget deficit. Conclusion Clearly the control of the Supreme Court is of critical importance, but so is control of the Federal Reserve. It is unclear who will win the Supreme Court battle, but it is not very hard to imagine who will win the struggle to control the Fed. More focus is needed to understand what this will do to the financial system and the economy. (Editor's note: The White House declined to comment.)

Chinese shares plunged on Friday with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 132.20 points, or 4.05 percent, to close at 3,129.85. The Shenzhen Component Index fell 371.36 points, or 3.58 percent, to close at 10,001.23. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) U.S. stock investors aren't the only ones suffering from anxiety over the Trump administration's trade policies. China's Shanghai composite is tracking for its worst year in seven after falling 8 percent in June, amid escalating trade tensions and Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on high debt levels. A relentless six-week selling streak has sent the mainland's benchmark stock index down 13.9 percent so far this year, to its lowest since 2016 and into a bear market \u2014 a more than 20 percent retracement from a recent high. Escalation in trade tensions with the U.S. spurred the latest sell-off, analysts said. But they also point to the overarching trend of Beijing's efforts to deleverage while maintaining economic growth. Neither of those factors are necessarily supportive for the local stock market in the near term. \"The sell-off was and is an impact of regulatory tightening,\" said Lauren Gloudeman, a research analyst with Rhodium Group\u2019s China markets research team. New policies, both recently implemented and forthcoming, limit the scale to which banks can keep riskier items off their balance sheets. A result is that some local non-financial institutions called \"trust companies\" are exiting their stock holdings, Glouderman said. At the same time, China is easing monetary policy to help support economic growth. The People's Bank of China announced Sunday that for the third time in 2018, it would lower its reserve requirement ratio for banks, improving the ability of businesses to get funding, or liquidity. The cut is set to take place on July 5, one day before U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect as the Trump administration tries to reduce the trade deficit and protect intellectual property rights. Beijing plans to retaliate the same day with its own duties on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods. The Shanghai composite steadied Friday, closing up 2.2 percent. But the index lost 8 percent for June in its worst month since January 2016 when it plunged more than 20 percent on worries of a sharp economic slowdown. \"We don't know how much [of] the deleveraging process has yet to take place,\" Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a phone interview Monday. \"In a way the stock market is a leading indicator on the economy because of liquidity concerns.\" \"Based on history, things are probably slowing down in China now,\" he said. \"So far the international markets have not picked up this slowdown at all.\" \u2014CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.

Morgan Stanley raised its rating to equal weight from underweight for Wells Fargo shares, predicting the Fed will likely lift its asset limit for the bank next year. \"Wells' Qualitative Pass in the stress test, coupled with 70% higher capital return approval y/y, eliminates one of our major downside concerns,\" analyst Betsy Graseck said in a note to clients on Monday entitled \u201cPositive Stress Test Results Lift Overhang.\u201d \"This also gives us more conviction that asset cap will be lifted by 2Q19.\u201d Graseck raised her price target to $62 from $57 for Wells Fargo shares, representing 12 percent upside to Friday\u2019s close.

India's banking sector crisis has left most state lenders hamstrung with mounting levels of bad loans, investigations into fraud and restricted growth opportunities. Amid that storm, private banks are set to emerge as winners. India's public-sector financial institutions control about 70 percent of all banking assets in the country, but they have the highest exposure to soured loans amounting to as much as $150 billion. In fact, the 21 state-owned banks had stressed loans of about 8.26 trillion rupees ($120 billion) as of Dec. 31, Reuters reported. Private sector lenders, meanwhile, reportedly had a bad loan pile of just about 1.1 trillion rupees. Private banks are more competitive Experts believe that, over the years, private sector banks will likely gain more market share from their state-run counterparts because they have stronger balance sheets, they are less exposed to stressed sectors, have stronger governance and are more competitive. \"If you take a 10-year view, currently the private sector banks' market share is 30 percent. Probably it will become 60 percent,\" Sukumar Rajah, senior managing director at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, told CNBC. As a result, he said, \"the overall health of the banking system will improve because the better banks will be a bigger portion of the market and the weaker banks will become a smaller portion of the market.\" Public sector banks are already losing market share, particularly the 11 banks that are placed on the Reserve Bank of India's prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, according to Sanjeev Prasad, co-head at Kotak Institutional Equities. That framework is used by the central bank to assess risks associated with banks based on capital, asset quality and profitability. When a bank is placed on the PCA, its ability to lend is restricted. Beyond that, reports have suggested that public sector banks might struggle to hold onto their share of the deposits market. But the question worth asking is whether India's private banks have enough deposits to do the heavy lifting to meet the funding requirements of one of the world's fastest growing major economies, Prasad said. Private banks have expanded their loan books in recent years and many of them have been running at \"really high credit-to-deposit ratios,\" he said. A credit-to-deposit ratio is usually used to measure a bank's liquidity by comparing its total loans to its total deposits. If the ratio is too high, it means the bank is lending out a large share of the deposits it has received. That might suggest potential liquidity problems during a downturn. show chapters A look at India's banking sector 4:27 AM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 02:27 India needs to work out a way to move deposits from public sector banks to private lenders, Prasad added. Still, there are alternative means of funding available to satisfy financing demands from companies and individuals. \"My view is that, incrementally, a lot of long-term financing of corporate India can also be met by the corporate bond market, which has developed reasonably well,\" he said. \"Between the corporate bond market and the private banks, I think most of the requirements can be met as far as corporate India is concerned.\" When it comes to lending directly to individuals, Prasad said that is mostly done by the private banks and non-banking financial companies. Why state-lenders are in trouble For years, state-owned banks have funded projects in sectors like steel, power and infrastructure that were not the best in class and they later became non-performing assets when the business cycle turned, Franklin Templeton's Rajah said. But unlike in the past, the current Indian government is a lot less willing to bail out the troubled banks by just recapitalizing them. Instead, it is pushing for greater structural changes. \"This government has taken a harder stance along with the [Reserve Bank of India], saying that 'you know this is a structural issue, we can't keep bailing out these banks.' It's too much of a waste of public money,\" Rajah said. He explained that the government would not allow state lenders to default, but it is also not going to guarantee profitability. Still, in January, the government said it would disburse nearly $14 billion into 20 public banks by March in exchange for them implementing reforms. That was part of a broader undertaking announced last October, where the government said it would inject about $33 billion into its state-run lenders over two years. Following that, the Reserve Bank of India tightened guidelines for banks to resolve bad assets in February. Under the new rules, banks are not able to use loan restructuring schemes to delay recognizing bad debt. As a result, banks' profitability took a hit as they had to declare many existing loans as non-performing assets and required higher loan loss provisions \u2014 they are counted as expenses that banks set aside as allowance for uncollected loans and loan payments. State lenders have also been plagued by fraud. For example, India's second-largest state lender Punjab National Bank said rogue employees orchestrated a massive $2 billion fraud over several years. The real challenge Experts agreed that declaration of non-performing assets by the banks was coming to an end over the next few quarters. But there are challenges ahead as banks begin to recover bad loans. Earlier this year, Tata Steel bought the insolvent Bhushan Steel for 352 billion rupees ($5.14 billion), which reportedly was nearly two-thirds of the loans the company owed to its lenders. \"So far, it seems to be going ahead,\" Prasad said. \"Real challenge will come when it comes to the next lot of the assets, which are the power companies and also the smaller [small-medium enterprise]-type businesses.\" He explained that it's unlikely that the troubled power companies are going to find willing buyers because the sector still has issues around distribution. Smaller companies are going to face the same problem and the only willing buyers are likely to be the current owners of the businesses, he added. Last year, India amended its insolvency and bankruptcy code, preventing willful defaulters from buying up any of their own troubled assets at discounted rates. show chapters The NPL issues are still 'dogging' India's banks: Economist 3:16 AM ET Fri, 1 June 2018 | 02:39 \"The problem is, if they don't amend the law, which currently bars promoters [company leaders] from putting in a bid for that asset, then many of these smaller companies will have to be liquidated,\" Prasad said, adding that would have socioeconomic implications in terms of job losses. \"The government will have to think through some of the issues,\" he added. \"They will have to strike some balance, in terms of maybe allowing the smaller companies or promoters to also bid for the same asset.\" Outlook for the banking sector The recognition of and the quick pace of resolution for non-performing assets will strengthen Indian banks over the next few years, according to Geeta Chugh, a senior director at S&P. \"Before the new bankruptcy code, the recovery rates in India were low at around 26 [percent] and it took over 4 years to recover,\" she told CNBC, referring to the portion of defaulted debt and interest that lenders could get back when a borrower became insolvent. She added that recovery in hard asset-backed sectors like steel would be much higher compared to companies in the engineering, procurement and construction industries. Harsh Modi, J.P. Morgan's co-head of Asia ex Japan banks equity research, explained that the retail-focused part of the banking system will likely continue to do well given that the credit penetration in Indian households is still very low and the growing economy will create a \"structural tailwind to the retail business.\" But the corporate lending business \u2014 that is, dealing with the bad loans \u2014 will be more event driven, Modi told CNBC. He explained that many of the non-performing assets have been recognized, but resolution will take time. It could take between 12 to 18 months to fully clean up India's banking sector, he added. Modi also explained that India's new bankruptcy laws remove subjectivity in the resolution process. \"It's as institutional and objective as it can get. That's the reason why we're reasonably hopeful that ... once it gets done, we can move on to the next phase of growth,\" he said. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

Central bank officials at their June meeting discussed another issue, this one relating to the mortgage-backed securities on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. According to the minutes from the June 12-13 gathering, proceeds the central bank is getting from the MBS it holds are running below the capped level of payments it has targeted for runoff later this year. Anything above the cap is supposed to be reinvested. Essentially, that means that the Fed will be letting all of those proceeds run off and not reinvesting anything, a new development but not one that was unanticipated. The situation likely means that the balance sheet reduction will be less than the $50 billion maximum that it was to hit in October. The Fed originally had intended to be running off $20 billion a month in MBS, along with another $30 billion in proceeds from Treasurys it is holding. show chapters Fed Minutes: Many districts report concern over tariffs 2:34 PM ET Thu, 5 July 2018 | 02:05 The Fed accumulated the bonds during its economic stimulus program that began in late 2008 during the financial crisis. The balance sheet had hit more than $4.5 trillion at one point, while the runoff program has resulted in a reduction of more than $100 billion so far. Fed officials noted that the MBS market is sensitive to long-term rates, so lower yields later could result in the need to reinvest again. The MBS discussion came as the FOMC approved an adjustment in the rate it pays on excess reserves that banks hold with the Fed. While it approved a quarter-point rate increase in the funds rate, it raised the interest on excess reserves rate only 0.2 percentage point. The funds rate had been moving to the top end of its range and getting close to the IOER rate. The Fed uses IOER as a guidepost for its benchmark funds rate. Since that move was approved, the funds rate again has jumped to the top of its range and most recently was within 0.04 point of the IOER. Fed officials in June said the reason the funds rate was moving higher could be due to higher rates in the overnight repo market.

Dell swung for the fences and ended up with a single. Maybe a double. After months of anticipation, Dell announced Monday that it's acquiring its publicly traded tracking stock that mirrors the performance of VMware. This simplifies the shareholding structure of the two companies significantly. Currently, Dell owns 82 percent of VMware. Of that portion, 50 percent is held by owners of the tracking stock DVMT. The other 32 percent is held by founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake, the owners of Dell's DHI. The remaining 18 percent of VMware is publicly traded. After the deal, Dell will be publicly traded, and will own 82 percent of VMware. show chapters Dell CEO Michael Dell on going public and VMware 10:56 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:42 But VMware, itself, will remain a publicly traded company, meaning that the remaining 18 percent of the company will still be owned by public shareholders. Dell has been looking at combining with VMware since the beginning of the year. This transaction doesn't do that. Michael Dell said Monday on CNBC that he has no plans to merge with VMware. \"We want them to remain an independent public company,\" he said. But he also said, \"We love VMware.\" So if you love VMware, why would you want it to remain an independent public company instead of owning 100 percent of it? The truth is, Dell does want to own as much of VMware as possible. That's why Dell was looking at doing a reverse merger with VMware, whereby it could have traded its stock, and potentially some cash, for VMware shares. But Dell won't say he wants to own VMware for several reasons. First, VMware's management, employee base and special committee were largely against a reverse merger. VMware shareholders weren't thrilled either. They didn't want to combine with a lower-growth company, which still earns a lot of money from selling servers and personal computers, two legacy product categories in flat-to-shrinking markets. The combined company would have traded at a much lower multiple to VMware, which wouldn't be good news for current investors. Second, Dell saying that he'd one day like to buy VMware would only increase the cost of VMware. That's not smart business. And Dell's financials (the company has about $50 billion of debt) make an outright purchase infeasible for the time being. That's not to say this deal is bad for Michael Dell or Silver Lake. Dell will become a publicly traded entity after the deal's completion. Dell simplifies its capital structure by eliminating the tracker stock. The company has liquid equity it can use for future acquisitions. Silver Lake can monetize its investment in Dell with a publicly traded currency. Then again, Michael Dell told CNBC on Monday he would buy out Silver Lake personally if and when the fund wants to sell. In that case, the company really doesn't need to be public. And if you read Michael Dell's comments Monday about why going public now makes sense, it's a bit ... jumbled: David Faber: You have told me you prefer to be private. What was the cost-benefit analysis that it was worth doing this transaction to become a public company again? Michael Dell: In the last five years, a lot has changed. We have completely transformed the business, become the essential infrastructure company \u2014 really changed the profile nature of the company in terms of our capabilities, a broad set of capabilities across the data center, software defined, everything, 85 percent of our engineers are software ... you look at our business last quarter, it grew 17 percent in growth, earnings were up strong double-digits \u2014 this was about simplifying our capital structure and exposing the value that we created to shareholders. Faber: But why was that worth doing again? I understand simplifying the capital structure is certainly something you might want to do, but why it worth becoming a public company to do it? Dell: Well, look, I think we went through a fairly exhaustive process that was disclosed in the 13-D filing and you guys reported on a fair bit and looked at all the various options. And we came to the conclusion along with two special committees that this was the best option. Huh? Yes, Dell has shown solid growth recently. Its servers and networking business grew 41 percent year over year in net revenue to $4.6 billion, according to the company's latest quarterly filing. Dell's storage business was also up 10 percent to $4 billion. Client Solutions Group net sales, which includes the sale of PCs, rose about 14 percent to more than $10 billion. But the reason that answer is so confusing is probably because simply going public actually isn't what Michael Dell wanted to do.

Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein on Monday upgraded shares of the Los Gatos, California-based pay TV company to outperform from perform, advising clients that the company's homegrown Roku Channel will likely help add to its roughly 21 million customers in the U.S. and capture $19 billion in revenue potential. The company, which continues to offer an easy way to access the top streaming services like rivals Apple TV and Chromecast, launched its own channel for users of Roku streaming players last fall, connecting customers to hundreds of movies and some TV shows they can stream for free. The Roku Channel includes content it licenses directly from film and television studios as well as content compiled from publishers, pitting the company against streaming giant Netflix. \u201cThe rapid adoption of The Roku Channel gives us incremental confidence in the channel's ability to garner viewership on other platforms, such as Samsung, allowing Roku to monetize a broader portion of the OTT ecosystem than we had previously assumed was possible,\u201d Helfstein wrote. Roku should be able to wield \u201cits advantages in pricing and merchandising to remain the market leader in consumer-facing connected television solutions.\u201d Roku shares rose 5.2 percent Tuesday following the Oppenheimer note. The company's stock is down roughly 16 percent in 2018 through Monday versus the S&P 500's 1.1 percent return. Helfstein set a price target of $50 on Roku shares, implying 15.5 percent upside over the next 12 to 18 months. Much of that upside, he wrote, will come from the company\u2019s ability to drive video advertising revenue, which could total as much as $19 billion given its expected market share. The stock went public last September at $14 a share. \u201cRoku\u2019s business today is generating users for the Roku platform, either on a Roku Player or the Smart TV Roku OS, and monetizing its partners\u2019 content, either by taking a share of subscription video on demand/advertising video on demand revenue or selling subscription video on demand advertisements itself and sharing the revenue with its partners,\u201d the analyst added.

Trump said Tuesday that his administration is talking with other motorcycle companies about moving to the U.S. \u201cNow that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017.

Last Wednesday Trump said in a tweet, \"Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I\u2019ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won\u2019t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!\" Harley-Davidson said on June 25 that tariffs implemented by the EU would increase the average cost per motorcycle by about $2,200 and the company will shift some production overseas as a result. The European Union imposed the tariffs in retaliation against the Trump administration's duties on steel and aluminum imports, which were an effort by Trump to protect U.S. jobs. No production will be moving to Europe as a result of the tariffs, according to the company. Harley's overseas manufacturing plants are in Brazil, India, Australia and Thailand. In the U.S., the company is shutting down a Kansas City, Missouri, factory and transferring operations to York, Pennsylvania.

In mid-December, the members of the firm\u2019s prime brokerage \u2014 a division that caters to hedge funds \u2014 had gathered at an intimate Lower East Side lounge called Et Al after leaving the team\u2019s gift-exchange party around the corner. They danced, drank and mingled with the club\u2019s dozens of other patrons. Within weeks, Omeed Malik, the most senior of the bank's employees at the impromptu event, left Bank of America. Soon after, media reports indicated the bank had investigated an accusation of inappropriate behavior by Malik that was lodged by one of the other employees present that night. But within months, the witnesses were also gone. Two of them left recently. But before that, in late February, reports surfaced that the two other employees were let go after the bank determined they \u201cinterfered\u201d with the probe into Malik\u2019s behavior. One of them, Joe Voboril, a 39-year-old former director within the prime brokerage unit, is fighting back, saying he did no such thing. He filed a claim on Friday alleging that Bank of America had retaliated against, wrongfully terminated and defamed him. The claim was filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-policing regulatory body for financial firms. Voboril, who says in the claim the bank ruined his reputation and stymied several opportunities for positions within Bank of America or at hedge funds, is seeking more than $20 million in damages, attorney\u2019s fees and to have his record cleared. CNBC reviewed his claim, which will be handled through arbitration, outside the public domain. Voboril declined to comment. After a series of prominent men in Hollywood and on television were ensnared in the #MeToo movement, in which detailed accounts of abuse from victims emerged, some in the media wondered aloud when the spotlight would turn to Wall Street. But many of the high-profile cases on Wall Street have been met by bankers who are fighting back against claims of inappropriate behavior. Malik, in his own FINRA claim against Bank of America, is seeking $100 million for what he says was defamation tied to his dismissal. Harold Ford, a onetime senator-turned-investment banker at Morgan Stanley, was reportedly fired last year after a journalist said he harassed her. The firm ultimately put out a statement saying that he was not terminated due to sexual misconduct. Voboril\u2019s attorney, Brian Kennedy, says that his client was collateral damage in Bank of America\u2019s move to use the #MeToo movement to remove employees. \u201cWe stand by our decision to terminate Mr. Voboril,\u201d said Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. \u201cWe will review the filing when we receive it.\u201d In his 60-page claim, Voboril paints the picture of a toxic culture within the bank's equities division. Voboril began at Bank of America in September 2015; he was recruited from a San Francisco-based firm to help Malik bring in new clients to their unit, which works with hedge funds to finance their various trades \u2014 including borrowing shares to sell short and bundling securities for sale. Source: Joseph Voboril Joseph Voboril By aligning with Malik, Voboril says in the claim that he immediately made an enemy of Martina Slowey, who ultimately became his direct supervisor within the firm. The claim says she reduced his responsibilities and his compensation, despite positive performance reviews. Both Malik and Voboril raised concerns that London-based Slowey did not have the appropriate FINRA licenses to be managing them \u2014 FINRA requires all individuals acting in a supervisory capacity to pass a so-called Series 24 exam. A search of FINRA\u2019s public database, BrokerCheck.org., did not turn up anyone with her name. Slowey didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and Bank of America declined to make her available. \u201cThe bank had appropriate supervisory structures at all times,\u201d Bank of America's Halldin said. Malik is pursuing his own arbitration claim against the firm, alleging defamation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment over the cancellation of his bonus. He is planning to file a separate suit against Bank of America in New York state court, his attorney said. \u201cMr. Malik was terminated by the bank not as a result of any of the sham and defamatory reasoning that the bank has noted to its primary regulator and to the news media, but rather, because he had complained about his direct supervisor being bereft of the requisite FINRA licensing,\u201d said John Singer, Malik\u2019s attorney. In firing Malik, \u201cthe bank illegally retaliated against Mr. Malik and illegally discriminated against him on the basis of his race, religion and national origin,\u201d Singer said of Malik, who is of Middle Eastern descent. Voboril alleges in his claim that Bank of America was telling FINRA regulators that Malik was his manager, while in the firm\u2019s internal organizational chart, Slowey served as his manager. FINRA declined to comment on the case. These are the grounds in which Voboril believes the bank retaliated. In early January, Voboril was called in to meet with Bank of America\u2019s employee-relations staff who inquired about the night of Dec. 13-14. Voboril got to the gift-exchange party at about 9 p.m. after putting his two children to bed, rejoining colleagues who had been drinking since 6 p.m., according to a person with knowledge of the night. He left Et Al at about 2 a.m. Voboril told them that he hadn\u2019t seen anything inappropriate from Malik or anyone else. Days later, employee relations called Voboril in again and asked him if he wanted to change his account. Others who had attended the party had a different recollection, he was told, and sticking to his original version would have negative repercussions, according to the claim. He replied that he had told the truth from the beginning. About a month after Malik was terminated, Voboril was called in for a third time by employee relations for questioning. He was asked if he wanted to change his story since Malik was gone, and he said no \u2014 that he had been telling the truth from the beginning. Of the four witnesses to any potential misconduct, two were put on leave (Voboril and a younger associate). Both were terminated on Feb. 28. Bank of America\u2019s \u201cfalse statement that Mr. Voboril and another 26-year-old female employee were terminated for \u2018interfering\u2019 with a sham review about yet another employee\u2019s personal conduct was merely a convenient cover for the firm,\u201d said Kennedy, Voboril\u2019s lawyer. Kennedy said that of the remaining two witnesses, one of them changed his story to appease the bank. It\u2019s unclear what the fourth witness saw or said. These remaining two employees were given high-profile roles in a Feb. 18 Bank of America conference in front of 60 of the firm's biggest hedge fund clients and 350 of its largest investors, according to the claim. Then, within weeks, both employees left Bank of America to join hedge funds. Within hours of hearing that he had been fired on Feb. 28, Voboril was contacted by reporters who said that sources told them that he and a colleague were let go for interfering with Malik\u2019s investigation. Since the filing with similar language \u2014 \u201cinterfering\u201d with an investigation \u2014 was filed 30 days later, Voboril\u2019s claim alleges that the bank may have been involved in informing reporters about the dismissals.

Bloomberg | Getty Images Tesla vehicles are transported on a truck after leaving the company's manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, on Wednesday, June 20, 2018. Several Wall Street firms are playing down Tesla's Model 3 production milestone, remaining skeptical over the carmaker's finances and demand trends. Tesla said Monday it reached its one-week production goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars for the last week of the June quarter. But the company fell short on its second-quarter deliveries by posting 40,740 vehicles delivered versus the Wall Street consensus expectation of approximately 51,000. Tesla shares fell 7.2 percent Tuesday. The company's shares hit the lows of the day on a report it decided to skip a \"brake-and-roll\" testing step in the manufacturing of its Model 3 vehicles. Tesla did eliminate the brake test because it deemed it to be redundant. show chapters Tesla eliminated brake tests in final days of Model 3 production 2:26 PM ET Tue, 3 July 2018 | 00:52 \u201cEvery car we build goes through rigorous quality checks and must meet exacting specifications, including brake tests. To be extremely clear, we drive *every* Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle. There are no exceptions,\u201d the company told CNBC. The carmaker's shares declined 2.3 percent on Monday after opening up 5 percent at the beginning of that day\u2019s session. Reuters also reported on Tuesdaythat Tesla shifted workers from other departments including the Model S production line to meet its Model 3 production target. Goldman Sachs was not impressed with the company\u2019s announcement and reiterated its sell rating for Tesla shares, noting net Model 3 reservations declined to 420,000 from 455,000 last year. \u201cModel 3 deliveries did miss our bearish estimates and we see the incremental color on Model 3 net reservations (where the company showed its first declining data point) as incrementally negative,\u201d analyst David Tamberrino said in a note to clients Tuesday. Tamberrino reiterated his $195 six-month price target for Tesla shares, representing 42 percent downside to Monday\u2019s close. One Wall Street analyst believes Tesla shares will drop further when the company reports its second-quarter earnings. \u201cGiven the softer overall trend to deliveries and implied negative read-across to 2Q earnings and cash flow, we expect a negative reaction in TSLA shares,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said a note to clients Tuesday. Brinkman reiterated his underweight rating and $180 price target for the carmaker\u2019s shares. show chapters Top Tesla watcher's 3 big predictions 5:54 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 11:11 In similar fashion, Citi Research reaffirmed its \u201cneutral/high risk\u201d rating Tesla shares, saying Monday\u2019s production announcement doesn\u2019t significantly change the company\u2019s finances. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe today\u2019s update will settle bull/bear debates about sustainable production/demand, FCF generating ability and the risks tied to Tesla\u2019s balance sheet position,\u201d analyst Itay Michaeli said in a note to clients Monday. Michaeli reaffirmed his $313 price target for Tesla shares. To be sure, not everyone on Wall Street is negative on Tesla\u2019s prospects. Nomura Instinet reiterated its buy rating and $450 price target for Tesla shares on Monday. \u201cTesla hit its production target of 5,000 Model 3\u2019s in the final week of the quarter, which is an important milestone that we believe reestablishes some credibility and positions the company for profitability in the second half of the year,\u201d analyst Romit Shah said in a note. \u201cThat said, we continue to expect TSLA shares to be volatile near term; we see current weakness as an opportunity to further accumulate shares.\u201d The company's shares are up 8 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500\u2019s 2 percent gain. When asked for comment, a Tesla spokesperson referred to the company's second-quarter vehicle production press release, which said the electric car maker produced 5,031 Model 3 vehicles in the last seven days of the quarter, while also producing 1,913 Model S and X vehicles in the same period. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.

As the rest of the stock market has struggled on heightened trade rhetoric and many big technology companies have faced regulatory scrutiny over data privacy issues, one subsector of that industry has been on fire: cybersecurity. One of the cybersecurity industry\u2019s most popular exchange-traded funds, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK), is up 18 percent in 2018. The fund launched in November 2014 as a new way to profit from the growing number of cyberattacks and data breaches plaguing U.S. companies. Since the epic data breach of more than 145 million customers at credit firm Equifax in September 2017, the fund has returned 31 percent, double the return of the S&P 500 over that same period. Although cybersecurity spending picked up beginning in 2016 as companies started to adopt a more platform-based approach to information security, those investments accelerated in mid-2017. Since then, an increasing number of organizations moved sensitive, proprietary data to cloud-based networks, and that trend has fueled shares across the cybersecurity landscape as companies look to protect that data. \"[Looking] at some of the top holdings of HACK, many of the positions are also our top picks across both security and storage,\" said Andrew Nowinski, Piper Jaffray senior research analyst. Companies in the fund include Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, FireEye, Juniper Networks, CyberArk Software, Symantec and Cisco. Several of those names have reported strong first-quarter earnings in the first half of 2018. And, while the group's success dates back to mid-2017, many analysts believe the group's climb took off in mid-February, a time when many of the top holdings in the index started to report earnings. Fortinet, meanwhile, has surged 66 percent since the Equifax hack, while CyberArk \u2014 touted for its leadership in managing privileged access information - has rallied 50 percent. \"I believe this reflects the investor community's willingness to take on greater risk for the longer-term investment opportunity that many of these stocks offer,\" said Kenneth Talanian, Evercore ISI software research analyst. And it\u2019s not just HACK. Another other popular ETF in the space, the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF, had rallied 23 percent since last July. IPOs Talanian also points to the recent flow of IPOs as key in fueling cybersecurity stocks' gains. Carbon Black and Zscaler are among the cyber-related names that have gone public in the past few months, and both handily beat analyst earnings projections in their first quarterly reports. Research and advisory firm Gartner recently projected spending on information security globally will climb 7 percent to $93 billion this year, compared with $86.4 billion in 2017. In a separate report, Cybersecurity Ventures estimated cybercrime damages will total $6 trillion annually by 2021\u2014 double the $3 trillion in damages in 2015. \"There is a major land grab opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months in cloud security for those security vendors that have the solution sets to protect critical cloud [information],\" GBH Insights Chief Strategy Officer Dan Ives said in a recent research note. Investors also point to the General Data Protection Regulation, a sweeping data privacy law that went into effect across the European Union last month, as a potential catalyst for the sector. GDPR extends beyond Europe's borders to apply to any company offering goods to EU citizens. As a result, a majority of corporations will rely on cybersecurity tools to better protect consumer information. \"We believe we are in the initial innings from an adoption perspective with regards to regulation,\" Eyal said. \"[T]hese could create significant pay winds for many of the [cyber] industry participants.\" He added that GDPR-related revenues already started to impact companies' income statements beginning in the second half of last year. Correction: Cybersecurity Ventures recently estimated that cybercrime damages will total $6 trillion a year by 2021.
