Some members expressed \u201cconcern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn,\u201d the meeting summary released Thursday stated. As a result, almost all officials at the central bank believe they should continue to raise interest rates on a regular basis. That comes even amid substantial worry that current tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners could stall the growth the economy has seen this year. Fed business contacts \u201cexpressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity.\u201d Moreover, they indicated \u201ccapital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.\u201d Those concerns, however, did not stop the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee from approving another quarter-point hike to the benchmark overnight borrowing rate. The funds rate moved to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, the seventh such increase since December 2015. 'Progressing smoothly' The move came amid an economy expected to grow by about 4 percent in the second quarter amid high levels of consumer and business sentiment and increasing levels of investment. Economic growth is \u201cprogressing smoothly\u201d the minutes stated, with activity \u201cexpanding at a solid rate,\u201d and \u201clabor market conditions continuing to strengthen.\u201d Inflation is hovering around the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation goal, the minutes also said. \u201cAlmost all participants\u201d thought the rate hike was appropriate. Committee members even approved removing a long-standing clause known as \u201cforward guidance,\u201d stating that the fund rate would remain \u201cbelow levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d In fact, officials said that if the current course continues, the rate actually could be above what they consider \u201cneutral\u201d by next year. Maintaining forward guidance \u201cwas no longer appropriate in light of the strong state of the economy and the current expected path for policy.\u201d Still, there were plenty of worries expressed at the meeting. Trade was a hot topic as the White House prepares to levy a series of tariffs that will take effect Friday. \u201cMost participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,\u201d the minutes stated. Members saw fiscal policy \u2013 last year\u2019s tax cuts as well as increased spending plans \u2013 as \u201csupportive of economic growth\u201d and posing \u201cupside risks,\u201d though a few worried that it is unsustainable. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the U.S. will be running a $1 trillion deficit by 2020, posing worries that debt will stymie economic growth. Fed officials also expressed some worry about conditions overseas. \u201cMany participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe and some\u201d emerging market economies. The jobs market and its 3.8 percent unemployment rate also came under some scrutiny. Members noted what has now become a frequently mentioned economic concern, namely the difficulty employers are experiencing in finding qualified workers to fill job openings. Business owners in some cases were increasing salaries and benefits to retain workers while others were offering training or turning to automation in lieu of searching for new workers. However, members noted that wage pressures remain \u201cmoderate\u201d though they expect wage inflation to pick up soon.

Not really focused upon as much is an offhand remark made by Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, in a recent television interview. Mr. Kudlow suggested that he hoped that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates very slowly. While one might agree or disagree with Mr. Kudlow\u2019s remark (I agree), what is of greater interest is that he made the statement. It breaks a precedent that presidents \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 have followed for more than two and half decades \u2013 i.e., the independence of the Federal Reserve would be respected. Mr. Kudlow understands that he is changing policy. What\u2019s more, he undoubtedly understands that the While House can, and I believe will, take total control of the Federal Reserve. It is very possible that monetary policy will become a political, not an economic or financial decision. Brief history History indicates that while the modern White Houses have not tread on the Fed, prior presidents always did so. Harry Truman fought so hard to force Marriner Eccles (then Fed chairman) to keep interest rates pegged at low levels that there had to be a meeting between the Treasury Department and the Fed to mediate the dispute. Truman ultimately lost. Lyndon Johnson was outraged that William McChesney Martin would raise rates as his Great Society initiative would take place. Johnson also lost as Martin took his \u201cpunch bowl away\u201d and raised rates. Jimmy Carter could do nothing as Paul Volcker may have cost Carter his presidency by driving rates so high that the nation suffered back-to-back recessions. Ronald Reagan and his Treasury Secretary James Baker did everything possible to get rid of Volcker. They ultimately had the support of the international financial community and Volcker was not reappointed. Richard Nixon had greatest success in his short confrontation with the Fed. According to the Nixon tapes and the view of most observers then and now, Nixon bent Arthur Burns to the President\u2019s will and easy monetary policies were put in place. Ultimately, when Burns decided to leave the Fed, G. William Miller took his position, but lasted less than two years due to what was considered to be his political leanings. Cake walk A look at today\u2019s Federal Reserve indicates that President Trump might have little resistance to gaining total control of the organization. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is supposed to have 7 members. It has three. Two of the three have their current positions because they were nominated by the President and approved by the Senate. The President can now nominate 4 more people to the Board. If at least two of these nominees make it through the Senate confirmation hearings, the President will have a durable majority on the Board. What will the president want? Understanding what the President wants from the Fed is not hard. He will want low interest rates for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Higher interest rates place tremendous strain on the Federal budget with its $20 trillion in debt. Higher rates theoretically can reduce economic growth. The President wants the stock market to continue to rise as a tangible indicator of the success of his economic programs.The Fed has just raised interest rates 7 times and it is being speculated that there could be 5 more increases. It is shrinking the agency\u2019s balance sheet and this is one key factor in the slowdown in money supply growth to 4.0 percent year-over-year or the lowest in 25 years. History argues that after 12 interest rate increases, a possible inverted yield curve, and very weak money supply growth, the stock market will not rise. Finally, it is unlikely that the President will fear higher levels of inflation. High inflation may be the only way to pay down the budget deficit. Conclusion Clearly the control of the Supreme Court is of critical importance, but so is control of the Federal Reserve. It is unclear who will win the Supreme Court battle, but it is not very hard to imagine who will win the struggle to control the Fed. More focus is needed to understand what this will do to the financial system and the economy. (Editor's note: The White House declined to comment.)

Trump said Tuesday that his administration is talking with other motorcycle companies about moving to the U.S. \u201cNow that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. Tweet Link Trump has repeatedly criticized the motorcycle manufacturer recently. Last Wednesday Trump said in a tweet, \"Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I\u2019ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won\u2019t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!\" Harley-Davidson said on June 25 that tariffs implemented by the EU would increase the average cost per motorcycle by about $2,200 and the company will shift some production overseas as a result. The European Union imposed the tariffs in retaliation against the Trump administration's duties on steel and aluminum imports, which were an effort by Trump to protect U.S. jobs.

Quantifying just how much damage an entrenched trade battle could wreak upon the international community is a trickier task, but J.P. Morgan has come up with three scenarios. In J.P. Morgan's first model, the U.S. is assumed to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 percentage points, with no retaliation. In the second, the U.S. action is met in equal fashion, with other countries that are the targets of U.S. tariffs imposing a 10-percentage-point increase in tariffs on imports from the U.S. In the third scenario, the entire world raises tariffs by 10 percentage points, a phenomenon J.P. Morgan calls a trade war. John Normand, the bank's head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, said he believes that the third, worst-case scenario could reduce global growth by a \u201cmaterial\u201d amount of at least 1.4 percent over the next two years. Source: J.P. Morgan \u201cOur economists acknowledge that such frameworks underestimate the likely damage that comes through disrupted supply chains, plus the feedback loops from tighter financial conditions,\u201d Normand said in a note to clients last week. \u201cPolicy uncertainty has a habit of denting consumer and business confidence, which in turn lowers household and corporate spending. The team\u2019s proprietary, composite measure of developed market business sentiment already shows such a drop, but from above-average levels due to U.S. tax stimulus.\u201d Though Normand acknowledged that those worst-case fears have yet to materialize, the J.P. Morgan researchers added that global growth could slow by about 0.4 percent if countries targeted by the United States respond by slapping equivalent tariffs on Washington. show chapters White House: Trump's tariffs aim to create a fair playing field 5:08 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 01:07 That scenario appears more like the one President Donald Trump finds himself stuck in after Canada started collecting duties on a variety of U.S. products on Sunday, including orange juice, yogurt, and whiskey. The Canadians will be reinforced by Mexico and China later this week in responding to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs when the two countries take aim at the U.S. pork and soybean industries. Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s initial duties worth $3.2 billion took effect June 22. The majority are duties of 25 percent and include a slew of U.S. products, including motorcycles, boats, whiskey and peanut butter. The three U.S. allies declared the new tariffs in direct response to the Trump administration's choice to levy imported steel and aluminum products. A cornerstone of Trump\u2019s campaign, the U.S.-centric philosophy remains key to the president\u2019s economic program in office. Trump has for months used his pulpit and economic tariffs to try to effect change in trade deals the administration deems unfair and ultimately harmful to American economic interests. Calling for \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade relationships, Trump has promised to dissolve the new U.S. tariffs only after more favorable deals are struck with trading allies. tweet Trump's battle for more balanced trade could end up helping the economy. The trade deficit appears to be on the decline, falling to a seven-month low in April, according to the Commerce Department. The trade gap dropped 2.1 percent to $46.2 billion, the smallest since September. If the trend continues, trade could contribute to gross domestic product in the second quarter, buoyed by strength in the manufacturing sector and consumer spending. The warning from J.P. Morgan\u2019s Normand, however, represents just the latest iteration in a string of cautious notes from the bank's analysts in recent months detailing the possible dangers of \u201cTrumponomics.\u201d Marko Kolanovic, the bank\u2019s head of quantitative strategy, estimated in June that the Trump\u2019s tough trade tactics have caused the destruction of more than $1 trillion in market value. \"By attributing the trade-related news flow (positive or negative) to the performance of the U.S. market, we estimated the impact on U.S. equities to be negative 4.5 percent\" since March, Kolanovic said in his June note. \"Taking the current market capitalization, this translates into $1.25 trillion of value destruction for U.S. companies. For a comparison, this is about two-thirds of the value of total fiscal stimulus.\" Kolanovic, who heads J.P. Morgan's global quantitative and derivatives strategy, predicted the stock market correction earlier this year and highlighted complacency and high leverage in the market as warning signs. Further, the strategist highlighted the impact of trade and protectionist ideology as \"significant\" market headwinds. \"A negotiation strategy that includes bluffing/threats can be successful in a two-party negotiation setup, but is more likely to deliver self-defeating results in a complex system such as global trade,\" he said. \"The value destroyed by a trade war might be reversible if policies are reversed, while the positive impact of fiscal measures is likely to remain. This would likely catalyze a rough 4 percent market rally.\" WATCH: Who loses from the ketchup tariff show chapters Canada's ketchup tariff will hurt food service businesses the most: Analyst 5:06 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:43 Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/02/105303750-1530560281925tesla_cars.jpg?v=1539369037", "time": "2018-07-02T16:19:18-0400", "author": "David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "CFRA Research lowers its rating to sell from hold for Tesla shares, citing the stock\u2019s valuation.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/tesla-drops-after-analyst-says-its-production-rate-is-not-sustainable.html", "title": "Tesla downgraded to sell by CFRA, which predicts Model 3 production rate is not 'sustainable'", "keywords": [{"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "8:01 AM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "2 July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "05:57 CFRA Research", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one-week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "5,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "the last week of the June quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "40,740", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "approximately 51,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Herculean", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "albeit a few hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "5,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Model 3", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Efraim Levy", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "2.3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the beginning of Monday\u2019s session", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Levy", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "12-month", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "300", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "12.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Tesla", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Roger McNamee", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "11:50 AM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "2 July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "04:24 Disclaimer", "category": "LOC"}], "body": " show chapters Tesla makes Model 3 production push 8:01 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 05:57 CFRA Research does not believe Tesla will be able to maintain its Model 3 production rate over the short term.

Bloomberg | Getty Images It began as an ordinary night for six Bank of America employees, who were out to celebrate the holidays. In mid-December, the members of the firm\u2019s prime brokerage \u2014 a division that caters to hedge funds \u2014 had gathered at an intimate Lower East Side lounge called Et Al after leaving the team\u2019s gift-exchange party around the corner. They danced, drank and mingled with the club\u2019s dozens of other patrons. Within weeks, Omeed Malik, the most senior of the bank's employees at the impromptu event, left Bank of America. Soon after, media reports indicated the bank had investigated an accusation of inappropriate behavior by Malik that was lodged by one of the other employees present that night. But within months, the witnesses were also gone. Two of them left recently. But before that, in late February, reports surfaced that the two other employees were let go after the bank determined they \u201cinterfered\u201d with the probe into Malik\u2019s behavior. One of them, Joe Voboril, a 39-year-old former director within the prime brokerage unit, is fighting back, saying he did no such thing. He filed a claim on Friday alleging that Bank of America had retaliated against, wrongfully terminated and defamed him. The claim was filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-policing regulatory body for financial firms. Voboril, who says in the claim the bank ruined his reputation and stymied several opportunities for positions within Bank of America or at hedge funds, is seeking more than $20 million in damages, attorney\u2019s fees and to have his record cleared. CNBC reviewed his claim, which will be handled through arbitration, outside the public domain. Voboril declined to comment. After a series of prominent men in Hollywood and on television were ensnared in the #MeToo movement, in which detailed accounts of abuse from victims emerged, some in the media wondered aloud when the spotlight would turn to Wall Street. But many of the high-profile cases on Wall Street have been met by bankers who are fighting back against claims of inappropriate behavior. Malik, in his own FINRA claim against Bank of America, is seeking $100 million for what he says was defamation tied to his dismissal. Harold Ford, a onetime senator-turned-investment banker at Morgan Stanley, was reportedly fired last year after a journalist said he harassed her. The firm ultimately put out a statement saying that he was not terminated due to sexual misconduct. Voboril\u2019s attorney, Brian Kennedy, says that his client was collateral damage in Bank of America\u2019s move to use the #MeToo movement to remove employees. \u201cWe stand by our decision to terminate Mr. Voboril,\u201d said Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. \u201cWe will review the filing when we receive it.\u201d In his 60-page claim, Voboril paints the picture of a toxic culture within the bank's equities division. Voboril began at Bank of America in September 2015; he was recruited from a San Francisco-based firm to help Malik bring in new clients to their unit, which works with hedge funds to finance their various trades \u2014 including borrowing shares to sell short and bundling securities for sale. Source: Joseph Voboril Joseph Voboril By aligning with Malik, Voboril says in the claim that he immediately made an enemy of Martina Slowey, who ultimately became his direct supervisor within the firm. The claim says she reduced his responsibilities and his compensation, despite positive performance reviews. Both Malik and Voboril raised concerns that London-based Slowey did not have the appropriate FINRA licenses to be managing them \u2014 FINRA requires all individuals acting in a supervisory capacity to pass a so-called Series 24 exam. A search of FINRA\u2019s public database, BrokerCheck.org., did not turn up anyone with her name. Slowey didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and Bank of America declined to make her available. \u201cThe bank had appropriate supervisory structures at all times,\u201d Bank of America's Halldin said. Malik is pursuing his own arbitration claim against the firm, alleging defamation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment over the cancellation of his bonus. He is planning to file a separate suit against Bank of America in New York state court, his attorney said. \u201cMr. Malik was terminated by the bank not as a result of any of the sham and defamatory reasoning that the bank has noted to its primary regulator and to the news media, but rather, because he had complained about his direct supervisor being bereft of the requisite FINRA licensing,\u201d said John Singer, Malik\u2019s attorney. In firing Malik, \u201cthe bank illegally retaliated against Mr. Malik and illegally discriminated against him on the basis of his race, religion and national origin,\u201d Singer said of Malik, who is of Middle Eastern descent. Voboril alleges in his claim that Bank of America was telling FINRA regulators that Malik was his manager, while in the firm\u2019s internal organizational chart, Slowey served as his manager. FINRA declined to comment on the case. These are the grounds in which Voboril believes the bank retaliated. In early January, Voboril was called in to meet with Bank of America\u2019s employee-relations staff who inquired about the night of Dec. 13-14. Voboril got to the gift-exchange party at about 9 p.m. after putting his two children to bed, rejoining colleagues who had been drinking since 6 p.m., according to a person with knowledge of the night. He left Et Al at about 2 a.m. Voboril told them that he hadn\u2019t seen anything inappropriate from Malik or anyone else. Days later, employee relations called Voboril in again and asked him if he wanted to change his account. Others who had attended the party had a different recollection, he was told, and sticking to his original version would have negative repercussions, according to the claim. He replied that he had told the truth from the beginning. About a month after Malik was terminated, Voboril was called in for a third time by employee relations for questioning. He was asked if he wanted to change his story since Malik was gone, and he said no \u2014 that he had been telling the truth from the beginning. Of the four witnesses to any potential misconduct, two were put on leave (Voboril and a younger associate). Both were terminated on Feb. 28. Bank of America\u2019s \u201cfalse statement that Mr. Voboril and another 26-year-old female employee were terminated for \u2018interfering\u2019 with a sham review about yet another employee\u2019s personal conduct was merely a convenient cover for the firm,\u201d said Kennedy, Voboril\u2019s lawyer. Kennedy said that of the remaining two witnesses, one of them changed his story to appease the bank. It\u2019s unclear what the fourth witness saw or said. These remaining two employees were given high-profile roles in a Feb. 18 Bank of America conference in front of 60 of the firm's biggest hedge fund clients and 350 of its largest investors, according to the claim. Then, within weeks, both employees left Bank of America to join hedge funds. Within hours of hearing that he had been fired on Feb. 28, Voboril was contacted by reporters who said that sources told them that he and a colleague were let go for interfering with Malik\u2019s investigation. Since the filing with similar language \u2014 \u201cinterfering\u201d with an investigation \u2014 was filed 30 days later, Voboril\u2019s claim alleges that the bank may have been involved in informing reporters about the dismissals. Soon, articles linking him to the investigation into Malik were online. One piece cited sources saying that bank officials believed Malik and his former colleagues were coordinating stories to throw off investigators. Voboril remains unemployed and says he is thinking about starting his own business.

Several Wall Street firms are playing down Tesla's Model 3 production milestone, remaining skeptical over the carmaker's finances and demand trends. Tesla said Monday it reached its one-week production goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars for the last week of the June quarter. But the company fell short on its second-quarter deliveries by posting 40,740 vehicles delivered versus the Wall Street consensus expectation of approximately 51,000. Tesla shares fell 7.2 percent Tuesday. The company's shares hit the lows of the day on a report it decided to skip a \"brake-and-roll\" testing step in the manufacturing of its Model 3 vehicles. Tesla did eliminate the brake test because it deemed it to be redundant. show chapters Tesla eliminated brake tests in final days of Model 3 production 2:26 PM ET Tue, 3 July 2018 | 00:52 \u201cEvery car we build goes through rigorous quality checks and must meet exacting specifications, including brake tests. To be extremely clear, we drive *every* Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle. There are no exceptions,\u201d the company told CNBC. The carmaker's shares declined 2.3 percent on Monday after opening up 5 percent at the beginning of that day\u2019s session. Reuters also reported on Tuesdaythat Tesla shifted workers from other departments including the Model S production line to meet its Model 3 production target. Goldman Sachs was not impressed with the company\u2019s announcement and reiterated its sell rating for Tesla shares, noting net Model 3 reservations declined to 420,000 from 455,000 last year. \u201cModel 3 deliveries did miss our bearish estimates and we see the incremental color on Model 3 net reservations (where the company showed its first declining data point) as incrementally negative,\u201d analyst David Tamberrino said in a note to clients Tuesday. Tamberrino reiterated his $195 six-month price target for Tesla shares, representing 42 percent downside to Monday\u2019s close. One Wall Street analyst believes Tesla shares will drop further when the company reports its second-quarter earnings. \u201cGiven the softer overall trend to deliveries and implied negative read-across to 2Q earnings and cash flow, we expect a negative reaction in TSLA shares,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said a note to clients Tuesday. Brinkman reiterated his underweight rating and $180 price target for the carmaker\u2019s shares. show chapters Top Tesla watcher's 3 big predictions 5:54 PM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 11:11 In similar fashion, Citi Research reaffirmed its \u201cneutral/high risk\u201d rating Tesla shares, saying Monday\u2019s production announcement doesn\u2019t significantly change the company\u2019s finances. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe today\u2019s update will settle bull/bear debates about sustainable production/demand, FCF generating ability and the risks tied to Tesla\u2019s balance sheet position,\u201d analyst Itay Michaeli said in a note to clients Monday. Michaeli reaffirmed his $313 price target for Tesla shares. To be sure, not everyone on Wall Street is negative on Tesla\u2019s prospects. Nomura Instinet reiterated its buy rating and $450 price target for Tesla shares on Monday. \u201cTesla hit its production target of 5,000 Model 3\u2019s in the final week of the quarter, which is an important milestone that we believe reestablishes some credibility and positions the company for profitability in the second half of the year,\u201d analyst Romit Shah said in a note. \u201cThat said, we continue to expect TSLA shares to be volatile near term; we see current weakness as an opportunity to further accumulate shares.\u201d The company's shares are up 8 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500\u2019s 2 percent gain. When asked for comment, a Tesla spokesperson referred to the company's second-quarter vehicle production press release, which said the electric car maker produced 5,031 Model 3 vehicles in the last seven days of the quarter, while also producing 1,913 Model S and X vehicles in the same period. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.

Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein on Monday upgraded shares of the Los Gatos, California-based pay TV company to outperform from perform, advising clients that the company's homegrown Roku Channel will likely help add to its roughly 21 million customers in the U.S. and capture $19 billion in revenue potential. The company, which continues to offer an easy way to access the top streaming services like rivals Apple TV and Chromecast, launched its own channel for users of Roku streaming players last fall, connecting customers to hundreds of movies and some TV shows they can stream for free. The Roku Channel includes content it licenses directly from film and television studios as well as content compiled from publishers, pitting the company against streaming giant Netflix. \u201cThe rapid adoption of The Roku Channel gives us incremental confidence in the channel's ability to garner viewership on other platforms, such as Samsung, allowing Roku to monetize a broader portion of the OTT ecosystem than we had previously assumed was possible,\u201d Helfstein wrote. Roku should be able to wield \u201cits advantages in pricing and merchandising to remain the market leader in consumer-facing connected television solutions.\u201d Roku shares rose 5.2 percent Tuesday following the Oppenheimer note. The company's stock is down roughly 16 percent in 2018 through Monday versus the S&P 500's 1.1 percent return. Helfstein set a price target of $50 on Roku shares, implying 15.5 percent upside over the next 12 to 18 months. Much of that upside, he wrote, will come from the company\u2019s ability to drive video advertising revenue, which could total as much as $19 billion given its expected market share. The stock went public last September at $14 a share. \u201cRoku\u2019s business today is generating users for the Roku platform, either on a Roku Player or the Smart TV Roku OS, and monetizing its partners\u2019 content, either by taking a share of subscription video on demand/advertising video on demand revenue or selling subscription video on demand advertisements itself and sharing the revenue with its partners,\u201d the analyst added.

India's banking sector crisis has left most state lenders hamstrung with mounting levels of bad loans, investigations into fraud and restricted growth opportunities. Amid that storm, private banks are set to emerge as winners. India's public-sector financial institutions control about 70 percent of all banking assets in the country, but they have the highest exposure to soured loans amounting to as much as $150 billion. In fact, the 21 state-owned banks had stressed loans of about 8.26 trillion rupees ($120 billion) as of Dec. 31, Reuters reported. Private sector lenders, meanwhile, reportedly had a bad loan pile of just about 1.1 trillion rupees. Private banks are more competitive Experts believe that, over the years, private sector banks will likely gain more market share from their state-run counterparts because they have stronger balance sheets, they are less exposed to stressed sectors, have stronger governance and are more competitive. \"If you take a 10-year view, currently the private sector banks' market share is 30 percent. Probably it will become 60 percent,\" Sukumar Rajah, senior managing director at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, told CNBC. As a result, he said, \"the overall health of the banking system will improve because the better banks will be a bigger portion of the market and the weaker banks will become a smaller portion of the market.\" Public sector banks are already losing market share, particularly the 11 banks that are placed on the Reserve Bank of India's prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, according to Sanjeev Prasad, co-head at Kotak Institutional Equities. That framework is used by the central bank to assess risks associated with banks based on capital, asset quality and profitability. When a bank is placed on the PCA, its ability to lend is restricted. Beyond that, reports have suggested that public sector banks might struggle to hold onto their share of the deposits market. But the question worth asking is whether India's private banks have enough deposits to do the heavy lifting to meet the funding requirements of one of the world's fastest growing major economies, Prasad said. Private banks have expanded their loan books in recent years and many of them have been running at \"really high credit-to-deposit ratios,\" he said. A credit-to-deposit ratio is usually used to measure a bank's liquidity by comparing its total loans to its total deposits. If the ratio is too high, it means the bank is lending out a large share of the deposits it has received. That might suggest potential liquidity problems during a downturn. show chapters A look at India's banking sector 4:27 AM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 02:27 India needs to work out a way to move deposits from public sector banks to private lenders, Prasad added. Still, there are alternative means of funding available to satisfy financing demands from companies and individuals. \"My view is that, incrementally, a lot of long-term financing of corporate India can also be met by the corporate bond market, which has developed reasonably well,\" he said. \"Between the corporate bond market and the private banks, I think most of the requirements can be met as far as corporate India is concerned.\" When it comes to lending directly to individuals, Prasad said that is mostly done by the private banks and non-banking financial companies. Why state-lenders are in trouble For years, state-owned banks have funded projects in sectors like steel, power and infrastructure that were not the best in class and they later became non-performing assets when the business cycle turned, Franklin Templeton's Rajah said. But unlike in the past, the current Indian government is a lot less willing to bail out the troubled banks by just recapitalizing them. Instead, it is pushing for greater structural changes. \"This government has taken a harder stance along with the [Reserve Bank of India], saying that 'you know this is a structural issue, we can't keep bailing out these banks.' It's too much of a waste of public money,\" Rajah said. He explained that the government would not allow state lenders to default, but it is also not going to guarantee profitability. Still, in January, the government said it would disburse nearly $14 billion into 20 public banks by March in exchange for them implementing reforms. That was part of a broader undertaking announced last October, where the government said it would inject about $33 billion into its state-run lenders over two years. Following that, the Reserve Bank of India tightened guidelines for banks to resolve bad assets in February. Under the new rules, banks are not able to use loan restructuring schemes to delay recognizing bad debt. As a result, banks' profitability took a hit as they had to declare many existing loans as non-performing assets and required higher loan loss provisions \u2014 they are counted as expenses that banks set aside as allowance for uncollected loans and loan payments. State lenders have also been plagued by fraud. For example, India's second-largest state lender Punjab National Bank said rogue employees orchestrated a massive $2 billion fraud over several years. The real challenge Experts agreed that declaration of non-performing assets by the banks was coming to an end over the next few quarters. But there are challenges ahead as banks begin to recover bad loans. Earlier this year, Tata Steel bought the insolvent Bhushan Steel for 352 billion rupees ($5.14 billion), which reportedly was nearly two-thirds of the loans the company owed to its lenders. \"So far, it seems to be going ahead,\" Prasad said. \"Real challenge will come when it comes to the next lot of the assets, which are the power companies and also the smaller [small-medium enterprise]-type businesses.\" He explained that it's unlikely that the troubled power companies are going to find willing buyers because the sector still has issues around distribution. Smaller companies are going to face the same problem and the only willing buyers are likely to be the current owners of the businesses, he added. Last year, India amended its insolvency and bankruptcy code, preventing willful defaulters from buying up any of their own troubled assets at discounted rates. show chapters The NPL issues are still 'dogging' India's banks: Economist 3:16 AM ET Fri, 1 June 2018 | 02:39 \"The problem is, if they don't amend the law, which currently bars promoters [company leaders] from putting in a bid for that asset, then many of these smaller companies will have to be liquidated,\" Prasad said, adding that would have socioeconomic implications in terms of job losses. \"The government will have to think through some of the issues,\" he added. \"They will have to strike some balance, in terms of maybe allowing the smaller companies or promoters to also bid for the same asset.\" Outlook for the banking sector The recognition of and the quick pace of resolution for non-performing assets will strengthen Indian banks over the next few years, according to Geeta Chugh, a senior director at S&P. \"Before the new bankruptcy code, the recovery rates in India were low at around 26 [percent] and it took over 4 years to recover,\" she told CNBC, referring to the portion of defaulted debt and interest that lenders could get back when a borrower became insolvent. She added that recovery in hard asset-backed sectors like steel would be much higher compared to companies in the engineering, procurement and construction industries. Harsh Modi, J.P. Morgan's co-head of Asia ex Japan banks equity research, explained that the retail-focused part of the banking system will likely continue to do well given that the credit penetration in Indian households is still very low and the growing economy will create a \"structural tailwind to the retail business.\" But the corporate lending business \u2014 that is, dealing with the bad loans \u2014 will be more event driven, Modi told CNBC. He explained that many of the non-performing assets have been recognized, but resolution will take time. It could take between 12 to 18 months to fully clean up India's banking sector, he added. Modi also explained that India's new bankruptcy laws remove subjectivity in the resolution process. \"It's as institutional and objective as it can get. That's the reason why we're reasonably hopeful that ... once it gets done, we can move on to the next phase of growth,\" he said. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Inc., speaks during a keynote session during the South By Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, U.S., on Saturday, March 10, 2018. Dell swung for the fences and ended up with a single. Maybe a double. After months of anticipation, Dell announced Monday that it's acquiring its publicly traded tracking stock that mirrors the performance of VMware. This simplifies the shareholding structure of the two companies significantly. Currently, Dell owns 82 percent of VMware. Of that portion, 50 percent is held by owners of the tracking stock DVMT. The other 32 percent is held by founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake, the owners of Dell's DHI. The remaining 18 percent of VMware is publicly traded. After the deal, Dell will be publicly traded, and will own 82 percent of VMware. show chapters Dell CEO Michael Dell on going public and VMware 10:56 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:42 But VMware, itself, will remain a publicly traded company, meaning that the remaining 18 percent of the company will still be owned by public shareholders. Dell has been looking at combining with VMware since the beginning of the year. This transaction doesn't do that. Michael Dell said Monday on CNBC that he has no plans to merge with VMware. \"We want them to remain an independent public company,\" he said. But he also said, \"We love VMware.\" So if you love VMware, why would you want it to remain an independent public company instead of owning 100 percent of it? The truth is, Dell does want to own as much of VMware as possible. That's why Dell was looking at doing a reverse merger with VMware, whereby it could have traded its stock, and potentially some cash, for VMware shares. But Dell won't say he wants to own VMware for several reasons. First, VMware's management, employee base and special committee were largely against a reverse merger. VMware shareholders weren't thrilled either. They didn't want to combine with a lower-growth company, which still earns a lot of money from selling servers and personal computers, two legacy product categories in flat-to-shrinking markets. The combined company would have traded at a much lower multiple to VMware, which wouldn't be good news for current investors. Second, Dell saying that he'd one day like to buy VMware would only increase the cost of VMware. That's not smart business. And Dell's financials (the company has about $50 billion of debt) make an outright purchase infeasible for the time being. That's not to say this deal is bad for Michael Dell or Silver Lake. Dell will become a publicly traded entity after the deal's completion. Dell simplifies its capital structure by eliminating the tracker stock. The company has liquid equity it can use for future acquisitions. Silver Lake can monetize its investment in Dell with a publicly traded currency. Then again, Michael Dell told CNBC on Monday he would buy out Silver Lake personally if and when the fund wants to sell. In that case, the company really doesn't need to be public. And if you read Michael Dell's comments Monday about why going public now makes sense, it's a bit ... jumbled: David Faber: You have told me you prefer to be private. What was the cost-benefit analysis that it was worth doing this transaction to become a public company again? Michael Dell: In the last five years, a lot has changed. We have completely transformed the business, become the essential infrastructure company \u2014 really changed the profile nature of the company in terms of our capabilities, a broad set of capabilities across the data center, software defined, everything, 85 percent of our engineers are software ... you look at our business last quarter, it grew 17 percent in growth, earnings were up strong double-digits \u2014 this was about simplifying our capital structure and exposing the value that we created to shareholders. Faber: But why was that worth doing again? I understand simplifying the capital structure is certainly something you might want to do, but why it worth becoming a public company to do it? Dell: Well, look, I think we went through a fairly exhaustive process that was disclosed in the 13-D filing and you guys reported on a fair bit and looked at all the various options. And we came to the conclusion along with two special committees that this was the best option. Huh? Yes, Dell has shown solid growth recently. Its servers and networking business grew 41 percent year over year in net revenue to $4.6 billion, according to the company's latest quarterly filing. Dell's storage business was also up 10 percent to $4 billion. Client Solutions Group net sales, which includes the sale of PCs, rose about 14 percent to more than $10 billion. But the reason that answer is so confusing is probably because simply going public actually isn't what Michael Dell wanted to do. If it's step one in a two-step process to combine with VMware, the deal makes more sense. The question is if VMware shareholders and a future special committee will ever be OK with that.

On Thursday, Cramer highlighted the work of Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, an outspoken bear on Tesla stock. \"People ignore him at their own risk,\" Cramer said of Sacconaghi, who was cut off by Tesla CEO Elon Musk during May's post-earnings call. Musk called Sacconaghi's question about gross margins \"boring\" and \"boneheaded.\" Cramer, the host of \"Mad Money,\" said the Bernstein analyst is asking the right, tough questions of Tesla. Musk on Thursday sounded off on Twitter at media organizations Reuters, Business Insider and CNBC. Musk accused both Reuters and Business Insider of publishing false or misleading stories. He also suggested CNBC features analysts with poor prediction records.

I'll buy them out.\" Dell Technologies announced Monday it will buy out the holders of shares that track the performance of VMware using a mix of cash and equity in Dell. The move means Dell will again trade on the stock market, about five years after the private equity firm Silver Lake and Michael Dell teamed up on a $24.9 billion deal to take the technology company private. \"In the last five years a lot has changed. We've completely transformed the business, become the essential infrastructure company, really changed the profile nature of the company in terms of our capabilities,\" Dell said. \"This was about simplifying our capital structure and exposing the value that we've created to shareholders.\" Silver Lake owns about 18 percent of the company. The tracking stock was introduced in 2016 to help Dell pay for its $67 billion purchase of EMC Corp. The new security was linked to part of EMC's interest in VMware, and the rest is publicly traded along with the tracking stock. Dell has been conducting a strategic review for several months as it has sought to consolidate its complicated ownership structure without overburdening its balance sheet, which bears around $50 billion in debt. Dell said it will propose to exchange each share of VMware tracking stock for 1.3665 shares of Dell Technologies Class C common stock, or at the holder's election, $109 in cash, subject to the total amount of cash consideration not above $9 billion. The transaction represents a premium of 28.9 percent to Dell's closing price on Friday. \"There is a technology led boom in investment that requires modern IT infrastructure, and Dell Technologies is the lead infrastructure company on the planet,\" Dell said. \"We've capture the hearts and minds of the decision-makers.\" show chapters Michael Dell says he is 'optimistic' about the world business economy 11:04 AM ET Mon, 2 July 2018 | 04:27 Shares of VMware rose nearly 10 percent. The cash component of the offer will be financed by a one-time $11 billion special dividend that VMWare will pay out pro-rata to its shareholders, VMWare said. After the deal, VMware shareholders would own between 20.8 percent to 31 percent of Dell, depending on how many investors opt for cash, Dell said. Dell considered several other transactions since January, including going public and pursuing a reverse merger with VMware. Dell has wanted to simplify its capital structure, give its private holders a publicly traded currency and increase its ownership of VMware. Back in May, Dell hinted at a stock deal with owners of DVMT, which has a market capitalization of about $17 billion. \u2014CNBC's Alex Sherman and Reuters contributed to this report.

Central bank officials at their June meeting discussed another issue, this one relating to the mortgage-backed securities on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. According to the minutes from the June 12-13 gathering, proceeds the central bank is getting from the MBS it holds are running below the capped level of payments it has targeted for runoff later this year. Anything above the cap is supposed to be reinvested. Essentially, that means that the Fed will be letting all of those proceeds run off and not reinvesting anything, a new development but not one that was unanticipated. The situation likely means that the balance sheet reduction will be less than the $50 billion maximum that it was to hit in October. The Fed originally had intended to be running off $20 billion a month in MBS, along with another $30 billion in proceeds from Treasurys it is holding. show chapters Fed Minutes: Many districts report concern over tariffs 2:34 PM ET Thu, 5 July 2018 | 02:05 The Fed accumulated the bonds during its economic stimulus program that began in late 2008 during the financial crisis. The balance sheet had hit more than $4.5 trillion at one point, while the runoff program has resulted in a reduction of more than $100 billion so far. Fed officials noted that the MBS market is sensitive to long-term rates, so lower yields later could result in the need to reinvest again. The MBS discussion came as the FOMC approved an adjustment in the rate it pays on excess reserves that banks hold with the Fed. While it approved a quarter-point rate increase in the funds rate, it raised the interest on excess reserves rate only 0.2 percentage point. The funds rate had been moving to the top end of its range and getting close to the IOER rate. The Fed uses IOER as a guidepost for its benchmark funds rate. Since that move was approved, the funds rate again has jumped to the top of its range and most recently was within 0.04 point of the IOER. Fed officials in June said the reason the funds rate was moving higher could be due to higher rates in the overnight repo market.

The firm lowered its rating on PepsiCo shares to hold from buy, predicting the company will report earnings below expectations this year. Analyst Steve Powers reduced his earnings per share forecast for PepsiCo's fiscal 2018 to $5.62 from $5.69 versus the Wall Street consensus of $5.67. \u201cWe see balanced risk/reward from current levels, noting continued competitive investment from the KO system, unfavorable FX, incremental cost inflation, and a further deterioration in emerging markets,\u201d Powers said in a note to clients Tuesday. The company's stock fell 0.7 percent Tuesday after the report. Powers reaffirmed his $116 price target for PepsiCo shares, representing 6 percent upside to Monday\u2019s close. The analyst predicts the company\u2019s gross profit margin will decline by 75 basis points in its second quarter because of inflation in commodity prices. \u201cWhile the company does have hedges in place, given incremental sequential inflation (aluminum, corn oil, orange juice, diesel), we see limited optimism for a turnaround in gross margins in the near future,\u201d he said. PepsiCo shares are underperforming the market this year. The stock declined 9 percent year to date through Monday compared with the S&P 500's 2 percent gain.

As the rest of the stock market has struggled on heightened trade rhetoric and many big technology companies have faced regulatory scrutiny over data privacy issues, one subsector of that industry has been on fire: cybersecurity. One of the cybersecurity industry\u2019s most popular exchange-traded funds, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK), is up 18 percent in 2018. The fund launched in November 2014 as a new way to profit from the growing number of cyberattacks and data breaches plaguing U.S. companies. Since the epic data breach of more than 145 million customers at credit firm Equifax in September 2017, the fund has returned 31 percent, double the return of the S&P 500 over that same period. Although cybersecurity spending picked up beginning in 2016 as companies started to adopt a more platform-based approach to information security, those investments accelerated in mid-2017. Since then, an increasing number of organizations moved sensitive, proprietary data to cloud-based networks, and that trend has fueled shares across the cybersecurity landscape as companies look to protect that data. \"[Looking] at some of the top holdings of HACK, many of the positions are also our top picks across both security and storage,\" said Andrew Nowinski, Piper Jaffray senior research analyst. Companies in the fund include Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, FireEye, Juniper Networks, CyberArk Software, Symantec and Cisco. Several of those names have reported strong first-quarter earnings in the first half of 2018. And, while the group's success dates back to mid-2017, many analysts believe the group's climb took off in mid-February, a time when many of the top holdings in the index started to report earnings. Fortinet, meanwhile, has surged 66 percent since the Equifax hack, while CyberArk \u2014 touted for its leadership in managing privileged access information - has rallied 50 percent. \"I believe this reflects the investor community's willingness to take on greater risk for the longer-term investment opportunity that many of these stocks offer,\" said Kenneth Talanian, Evercore ISI software research analyst. And it\u2019s not just HACK. Another other popular ETF in the space, the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF, had rallied 23 percent since last July. IPOs Talanian also points to the recent flow of IPOs as key in fueling cybersecurity stocks' gains. Carbon Black and Zscaler are among the cyber-related names that have gone public in the past few months, and both handily beat analyst earnings projections in their first quarterly reports. Research and advisory firm Gartner recently projected spending on information security globally will climb 7 percent to $93 billion this year, compared with $86.4 billion in 2017. In a separate report, Cybersecurity Ventures estimated cybercrime damages will total $6 trillion annually by 2021\u2014 double the $3 trillion in damages in 2015. \"There is a major land grab opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months in cloud security for those security vendors that have the solution sets to protect critical cloud [information],\" GBH Insights Chief Strategy Officer Dan Ives said in a recent research note. Investors also point to the General Data Protection Regulation, a sweeping data privacy law that went into effect across the European Union last month, as a potential catalyst for the sector. GDPR extends beyond Europe's borders to apply to any company offering goods to EU citizens. As a result, a majority of corporations will rely on cybersecurity tools to better protect consumer information. \"We believe we are in the initial innings from an adoption perspective with regards to regulation,\" Eyal said. \"[T]hese could create significant pay winds for many of the [cyber] industry participants.\" He added that GDPR-related revenues already started to impact companies' income statements beginning in the second half of last year. Correction: Cybersecurity Ventures recently estimated that cybercrime damages will total $6 trillion a year by 2021.

On Monday, Yardeni Research said technology companies bought back $1 trillion worth of their shares since the beginning of the bull market in the first quarter of 2009, followed by the consumer discretionary sector at $632 billion. Apple represented about 20 percent of the technology sector's total with $199.6 billion of share repurchases in the time period, according to its website. The firm noted the two sectors were the top performing areas in the stock market. Consumer discretionary shares rose 592 percent since March 2009, while the technology sector rallied 511 percent. The technology industry also led buybacks in the first quarter this year at $63.4 billion, leading to the second-best sector performance year to date at a 10 percent return, according to Yardeni. \u201cThe buybacks help to explain the outperformance of the S&P 500 Information Technology sector so far this year,\u201d strategist Ed Yardeni said in the note to clients. Market research firm TrimTabs said earlier this week share buyback intentions reached a record high in the second quarter. Corporations announced $433.6 billion in share repurchases during the period, nearly doubling the previous record of $242.1 billion in the first quarter. In addition to the buyback surge, companies issued a record $111.6 billion in dividends during the second quarter, bringing the 2018 total to $220.8 billion, a 7.8 percent increase over the same period a year ago, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones indices. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

The billionaire recently opened his Point72 hedge fund to outside investors in the U.S., but British securities regulators won't let Cohen open the fund to U.K. investors, according to a report in the FT, citing people familiar with his application to do business there. That makes it the second rebuff by British regulators in a year. Cohen had been managing his own money through Point72 after American regulators banned him from managing money for other people for two years. The ban was part of an agreement Cohen reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission after his former hedge fund, SAC Capital, was swept up in an insider trading scandal. The U.S. ban lifted in January and since then, Point72 has raised $3 billion from outside investors, the FT said. But the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority won't let him open to outside money there, according to the report, which cited one person saying the FCA ruled Cohen was not \"fit and proper\" to do so. Cohen had withdrawn the application earlier after the regulator indicated reluctance to approve it. A spokesman for Cohen declined to comment on the report. Read the full Financial Times story here.

Beijing has said it would retaliate immediately with tariffs of its own. That leaves U.S. farmers in the crossfire. \"Rural communities are dependent on agriculture. It\u2019s their life blood,\" Casey Guernsey, a seventh-generation beef farmer in the Missouri-Kansas-Iowa area, told CNBC. China's new tariffs will impact a number of American agricultural products, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and pork, as well as U.S. autos. Beijing's import levies could end up costing farmers in the state of Missouri as much as $138 million annually, said Guernsey, owner of CL Guernsey, a family farm. That includes the impact of lower prices for farm commodities and potential lost business due to new import duties. One in four pigs raised in the U.S. is sold overseas, and the Chinese are the world's top consumers of pork. Missouri is one of the top 10 states in pork production. \"We can't afford any increase in price,\" Guernsey said on \"Closing Bell\" Thursday. \"The difference between making money and losing money per head sometimes is just a couple of dollars. And whenever you\u2019re looking at duties like this, it could make or break the operation.\" In fact, the tariffs might only make the situation worse for some farmers. The agricultural economy has been in a down slump for more than a decade. Profits from U.S. farms are forecast to reach a 12-year-low in 2018, according to the Department of Agriculture. Robyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images Cows graze on a dairy farm in Porterville, California. President Donald Trump first proposed tariffs last March in an effort to fix what he deemed unfair trading practices and help both American consumers and business owners. Tariffs against Canada, Mexico and the European Union went into effect on June 1. Since then, Mexico, Canada and the European Union have issued retaliatory tariffs of their own, targeting items such as agricultural products, steel, motorcycles and spirits. Ron Moore, a farmer from Roseville, Illinois, and the chairman of the American Soybean Association, said the tariffs are \"devastating\" to soybean farmers. In fact, nearly $14 billion worth of soybeans exported to China will be impacted by tariffs. That's roughly one third of the total soybean production in 2017. With the new tariffs in place, many farmers fear China will cancel soybean shipments to the U.S. for the remainder of the year. Guernsey said he's already seeing the negative effects play out in the farming community. Mexico, he said, is one of the top partners for beef products. \"And we can't afford to lose that market whatsoever,\" Guernsey said. The farmer, who also served as a Missouri state representative, said he was planning on building a new barn this year, but said it's now no longer economically feasible. Among his farm customers in Missouri, he said many are selling off their breeding stock. \"And that has long-term implications, not just for their farm, but for ours and for the entire community,\" Guernsey said. Moore said he understands the Trump administration's goals in imposing the tariffs and acknowledged that \"mostly rural America\" supported Trump during the election. \"We just think there are alternative choices to go about trying to bring China to trade fairly, [rather] than going into the tariff wars,\" he said on \"Squawk Alley\" on Friday.

6:59 AM ET Thu, 28 June 2018 | 04:00 Shares of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi stumbled on their debut in Hong Kong on Monday, opening for trade down more than 2 percent and slipping as much as 5.88 percent during the session. That came after a disappointing pricing and a listing delay in mainland China. Xiaomi shares opened down at 16.60 Hong Kong dollars ($2.12) a share, according to Dow Jones, below the initial public offering price of HK$17 ($2.17). Shares traded at HK$16.58 apiece as of 3:35 p.m. HK/SIN before closing at $16.80, after slipping as low as HK$16 earlier. The company had earlier set a range of HK$17 to HK$22 for the approximately 2.18 billion shares on offer, eventually pricing its IPO at the low-end of an indicative range on Friday. Following the deduction of fees and expenses, Xiaomi said it raised around HK$23.97 billion ($3.05 billion). The broader Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, rose 1.32 percent to close at 28,688.50. The Chinese company, established only in 2010, is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer by producing low-priced devices that have drawn comparisons \u2014 favorable and accusatory \u2014 to the iPhone. \"I think short-term stock price is mostly dictated by market conditions. What we will be doing is to focus on the long-term growth of our business,\" Xiaomi President and Co-Founder Lin Bin told CNBC's Emily Tan on Monday. Isaac Lawrence | AFP | Getty Images Xiaomi founder, chairman and CEO Lei Jun hits a gong at the company's initial public offering launch on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on July 9, 2018. Xiaomi's soggy debut performance hasn't come as much of a surprise for some analysts. \"The share was priced at a very high valuation multiple, substantially higher than its global peers. Even though Xiaomi remained to be a very good story, I think the market is at a stage where you have to prove yourself first before the market can give you a good valuation,\" Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, told CNBC. \"No matter how you look at it, it's too expensive for me,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive officer at brokerage GEO Securities, drawing comparisons between the price-to-earnings ratio of Xiaomi and Apple. Analysts had earlier cited a range of factors for the relatively weak pricing, such as the Chinese CDR delay and recent negative investor sentiment toward global equities, including recent stock market downturns in China and Hong Kong, amid trade war fears between the United States and China. Lin told CNBC that the impact of the trade fight between the world's two largest economies wasn't a huge concern in the short term as Xiaomi had not done much business in the U.S. show chapters Shares of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi open for trade below IPO price 3:06 AM ET Mon, 9 July 2018 | 02:40 Analysts have also said the market might have concluded that Xiaomi has been overhyped. \u201cHonestly, Xiaomi is not an internet company,\u201d said Dickie Wong, executive director for research at Kingston Financial in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hardware company,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d But Lin suggested that the kind of company Xiaomi was being categorized as was of little importance: \"I don't know how to call us. Make a name for us, we'll be happy to accept anything.\" And while markets still expect Xiaomi to eventually offer CDRs, there's a split in opinion on when that will happen. Some see it as early as the next few months and others project it won\u2019t start until next year. Xiaomi's Lin didn't give additional details about when that may happen. \"We decided to postpone the CDR just to ensure the success of the CDR with a very graceful, mutual agreement with CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission).

Utilities \u2014 classic defensive plays with domestic-only markets \u2014 could also benefit if this is a prolonged conflict, some said. Others are sticking with the hot small cap trade in the face of this escalating conflict. With both Beijing and Washington slapping each other with $34 billion in new tariffs Friday, some market strategists voiced concern a breakdown of global trade could hurt companies with large overseas markets and supply chains. As a result, stocks that stand to outperform peers are likely those of companies with mostly U.S. exposure and so-called bond proxies, according to Credit Suisse. \u201cCyclical stocks with a high percentage of foreign sales tend to be most threatened by the potential for increased trade tensions,\u201d Credit Suisse\u2019s equity chief Jonathan Golub wrote in a note earlier this year. \u201cAnother potentially lucrative approach to trading trade tensions: focus on interest rate impacts.

Alternatively, credit Cuisse said that global players like Baker Hughes, Mosaic and 3M could be the most exposed if trade relations sour further. All three equities have underperformed the broader stock market over the past 30 days. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, told investors to consider domestic, consumer companies as a way of navigating turbulent trade policies. \"Many Trump campaign proposals, such as infrastructure spending and tax reform, that investors had expected would boost US growth have not been implemented. As a result, domestic-facing firms have lagged,\" David Kostin, the bank's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote last July when the trade tensions were first starting to appear. \"Looking forward, any impediments to foreign trade such as tariffs or trade disputes would likely benefit stocks with high domestic sales relative to export-oriented firms.\" \"Although our economists have estimated that the effects of tariffs on growth would vary depending on size, foreign retaliation and time horizon, US equities appear to be relatively insulated,\" he added. \"Foreign sales account for just 31 percent of S&P 500 revenues; smaller firms such as those in the Russell 2000, which derive 80 percent of revenues domestically, are even less exposed.\" Sectors with high foreign revenue exposure, Kostin said, include information technology, materials and energy; sectors with the lowest overseas sales include telecommunications, utilities and real estate. John Vail of Nikko Asset Management told CNBC that while there would likely be \u201cfew winners\u201d during a trade war, consumer names could prove relatively good bets. \u201cMore domestic, consumer oriented stocks would probably do better. Some might even do well if it\u2019s extremely defensive,\u201d Vail said. \u201cIf bond yields fall as a result of a more cautious Fed, utilities could do well. In this case, the U.S. economy would be affected as well, so the Fed would be reacting to that as well.\u201d Still other have suggested taking a look at small-cap stocks as a means of weathering a global trade crisis. The Russell 2000 index \u2013 which tracks the performance of smaller equities \u2013 has rebounded to record highs well ahead of both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. In fact, the index closed at an all-time high within the past three week and remains less than 1 percent the record. \"I think the small-cap rally has been much a flight to safety, away from geopolitical concerns, tariff issues, and all the things that bother the multinationals. The safety trade has been to go to small-caps, which are much more U.S.-centric,\" Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in April on CNBC's \u201cTrading Nation.\u201d However, others worry that the small-cap trade may be growing too crowded to make it a compelling investment. The Russell 2000 trade is one of the most crowded trades in the world, meaning that investors ought to consider names \u201cless trampled all over,\u201d said Larry McDonald, managing director and head of global macro strategy at ACG Analytics. Instead, \u201cthe staples trade could be one of the best trades in years and they\u2019re under-owned,\u201d said McDonald, also a CNBC contributor and editor of the Bear Traps Report. \u201cThis trade war could trigger a stampede into staples, the XLP.\u201d Asked about a possible bid for the U.S. dollar, the strategist said he\u2019d steer clear of the greenback until it\u2019s clear the Fed won\u2019t be tempted to relax their path toward higher rates. \u201cIf the Fed reverses its path, the dollar is going to get smoked: The dollar is a global wrecking ball,\u201d he added. In its place, he suggested traders turn to gold and silver as safe haven bid if things spin out of hand, saying the metals could see a 20 percent rally if the Fed decides to back away from its hawkish tone as in 2015 and 2016.

Procter & Gamble's profitability will suffer because of rising commodity costs, according to Jefferies. The firm lowered its rating for Procter & Gamble shares to hold from buy, predicting the company will report earnings below expectations next fiscal year. Analyst Kevin Grundy cited a number of factors weighing on the consumer product giant, including slowing market growth, emerging market volatility, U.S. retail difficulties, a stronger U.S. dollar and pricing challenges that \"should drive estimates lower again at P&G.\" His note on Monday was titled \u201cTide Unlikely to Turn: Downgrade to Hold as Bull Thesis Wanes.\" Grundy lowered his price target to $79 from $83 for Procter & Gamble shares. The new target is roughly even with Friday\u2019s closing price. The analyst noted a price basket of P&G key commodities costs has risen by about 15 percent over the past year. He said the company doesn\u2019t have the ability to pass through higher costs to consumers. \u201cCommodities [are] a significant headwind,\u201d he said. \u201cP&G is expected to report its first year of negative pricing in well over a decade as the pricing environment has clearly become more difficult.\u201d As a result of gross profit margin pressure, Grundy reduced his fiscal year 2019 earnings per share estimate for the company to $4.25 from $4.52 versus the Wall Street consensus of $4.43. \u201cP&G (as well as other companies in our coverage) does not expect EMs or category growth rates to materially improve in the near-to- intermediate term,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, competitive dynamics, particularly in P&G\u2019s Baby and Grooming businesses (combined ~30% of global profits) will likely remain difficult.\u201d Procter & Gamble shares are underperforming the market this year. The stock declined 14 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 3 percent gain. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Harley-Davidson 12:52 PM ET Thu, 5 July 2018 | 04:46 Harley-Davidson riders in Europe don't care whether the iconic American motorcycles are made in the United States, custom motorcycle builder Alan Stulberg told CNBC. \"They\u2019re concerned more about the pricing of the model as it compares to other options available in Europe,\" said Stulberg, co-founder of Revival Cycles, a motorcycle shop based in Austin, Texas, that restores vintage bikes and sells custom-built bikes starting at around $115,000. \"What [Harley-Davidson riders] are buying is the heritage of America-built,\" Stulberg said Thursday on \"Squawk Alley.\" \"But it being made in America isn\u2019t really a priority.\" Just two days earlier, President Donald Trump taunted Harley-Davidson on Twitter, saying, \u201cNow that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!\" TWEET Full-year sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles declined 7.2 percent in 2017, compared with the previous year. The iconic American motorcycle company's U.S. retail motorcycle unit shipments also dropped 10.5 percent in the same time period. Meanwhile, sales of less expensive Japanese motorcycles, such as Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha, as well as stylish Swedish bikes, increased. But a combination of aging Harley riders and changing consumer preferences appears to be responsible for Harley-Davidson's sales decline in recent years \u2014 not the consumers' desire to buy made in America. Kelly Yun of Minneapolis said it was her \"love of riding\" that motivated her to buy her Harley. \"I was in Ecuador and saw Harleys,\" she told CNBC. \"I thought, that's great. It's kind of like a German car in the United States. I wouldn't care where it was made.\" Stulberg pointed out that Harley-Davidson has been building motorcycles outside of the U.S. for some time, with manufacturing plants in Brazil, India, Australia and Thailand. \"This isn't a new thing for them,\" he said. Getty Images Harley-Davidson motorcycles are offered for sale at a Harley-Davidson dealership. On June 25, the company said it was moving some of its production overseas to avoid EU tariffs. Harley-Davidson said the tariffs would increase the average cost per motorcycle sold in Europe by about $2,200. Trump quickly showed his disapproval through a series of tweets. Ken Schmidt, former director of communications at Harley-Davidson, said the company is \"being chastised for doing something that any company in its position would do.\" \"[Harley-Davidson] is just working to protect the franchise,\" Schmidt said Thursday on \"Squawk Alley.\" \"[It's] working to keep the flow of product moving into, in this case, the European Union, its second-largest market, and to sustain its business. Any company would make those decisions. So, to be singled out as having done something wrong or something that is anti-American ... it just smells bad.\" Harley-Davidson would not comment on Trump's tweets or its declining sales. But Michael Pflughoeft, communications director for the company, confirmed that all motorcycles made overseas are sold overseas. The company is shutting down a Kansas City, Missouri, factory and transferring those operations to York, Pennsylvania.

According to the central bank's latest meeting minutes, business contacts \u201cexpressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity.\u201d Further, they indicated \u201ccapital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.\u201d The problem is not so much that the current tariff proposals would undermine global gross domestic product in a major way, but that business leaders might opt to forgo capital spending and other investments given the uncertainty surrounding trade deliberations. show chapters Fed Minutes: Many districts report concern over tariffs 2:34 PM ET Thu, 5 July 2018 | 02:05 \"Generally, the plan is on: Gradual increases in rates is still what\u2019s on the table,\" said Putri Pascualy, managing director and credit strategist at PAAMCO. \"The one thing I think is notable is the fact that the risk of trade policy, and specifically tariffs, has been identified as the one key factor that could derail the economic engine. The Fed seems less concerned about the economic impact of the tariffs themselves.\" \"What is potentially important is the impact on confidence,\" Pascualy added. \"It could change peoples or business\u2019 plans on investment.\" Such a widespread shift could be so significant as to hamstring such of the positive impact derived from last year's tax cuts and federal spending. \u201cMost participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,\u201d the Fed minutes continued. Members saw fiscal policy \u2013 last year\u2019s tax cuts as well as increased spending plans \u2013 as \u201csupportive of economic growth\u201d and posing \u201cupside risks,\u201d though a few worried that it is unsustainable. \"The implications [of an escalating trade war] will surely be much further reaching,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets. \"The knee jerk market reaction will likely be to the severity or lack thereof in China\u2019s response, however the longer-term fundamental fallout on global demand/inflation remains our primary concern. Higher input costs are already flowing through to U.S. producers, and beginning Friday the additional $34 billion of goods that will now be subject to tariffs will further exacerbate the pain felt as a result of the protectionist measures.\" \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

The U.S. officially implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, including water boilers, airplane tires and X-ray machine components. China responded with its own set of tariffs on U.S. pork and soybeans, among other goods. This tit-for-tat trade war would mostly impact states that voted \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in favor of Trump in 2016 \u2014 relative to the states won by Hillary Clinton \u2014 as they possess \u201cjobs and output significantly affected by tariffs,\u201d Dana Peterson, Citi's North America economist, said in a note Thursday evening. Peterson pointed out that so-called red states have 3.9 million jobs linked to foreign trade, far more than the 2.5 million in blue states. She added that \u201c80 percent of \u2018red\u2019 states produce goods subject to retaliatory tariffs totaling 10 percent or more of GDP, compared to 10 percent of \u2018blue\u2019 states.\u201d The tariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods come after months of posturing by both countries. Back in March, Trump announced tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., to which China \u2014 along with other key trade partners \u2014 threatened to retaliate. The back-and-forth on trade rhetoric has kept U.S. equities in a range as investors assess the impact of tariffs on corporate profits and global economic growth. The S&P 500 has traded in a 7.5 percent range since March. Since May, the S&P 500\u2019s range had gotten even tighter as the broad index oscillates in a 5.4 percent band. show chapters We depend on global markets for our high-quality grains: Montana farmer 3:40 PM ET Fri, 6 July 2018 | 04:58 \u201cUS external trade actions are backfiring, risking a reduction in global trade,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cUS tariffs on imported goods are designed to encourage a rebalancing of trade that benefits domestic firms and US exporters. The Trump Administration\u2019s goal of opening closed markets and establishing reciprocal trade abroad has alternatively been met with reciprocal retaliatory tariffs and complaints to the WTO.\u201d \u201cThe dollar value of the US and reciprocal tariffs are nominal, but the tit-for-tat could escalate into a trade war that reduces global, and thereby US trade,\u201d she said. Trade tensions have also been rising ahead of the U.S. midterm elections in November, when Democrats appear primed to gain seats in the House and possibly a majority. \u201cEconomies exacting retaliatory measures are openly targeting goods produced in \u2018red\u2019 states, and sectors the President champions, as well as states represented by key players in Congress, including majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate. Hence, the intensity and duration of the trade disputes may be calibrated by voter sentiment ahead of the midterm elections,\u201d said Peterson.

Chinese internet search behemoth Baidu is poised for stronger revenue as advertising on its news feed improves, spelling further upside for investors, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The bank upgraded its rating on shares of the Beijing-based company to overweight from sector weight on Monday, predicting that between its rising ad sales and outlook in artificial intelligence, Baidu could be set for a year of growth. \u201cOur upgrade is based on observations of a change in the prospects for the outlook for Baidu Core business in the near to midterm,\u201d analyst Hans Chung said in a note to clients. In addition to the healthier ad revenue, the analyst said Baidu\u2019s Phoenix Nest system \u2013 a new machine learning online marketing system \u2013 could drive incremental revenue gains from search queries and improve conversion rates. \u201cThe new system could better match ads to users through targeting capabilities on a real-time basis and self-improved manner, which drive incremental ad inventory without increasing ad loads,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite unfavorable secular trends in search traffic, we believe the new system can deliver growth in paid clicks and revenue with potential upside in the future.\u201d Baidu, which last provided investors an update on its earnings in April, said at the time that the search firm\u2019s news feed received a surprising bump in the first quarter due to a crackdown by Chinese internet regulators on low-brow content, disrupting several competitors. The unexpected boon comes two years after censors hampered Baidu's performance after a widespread review of advertising practices, which eroded its marketing client base and froze its revenue growth. Since then, the company has sold or exited a number of businesses to concentrate on ventures in artificial intelligence and its news feed. The analyst\u2019s 12-month price target of $305 is 21 percent higher than Friday's closing price. \u201cAccording to checks from our field work, we see a stronger ramp in news feed ad revenue driven by higher user engagement with daily active users of 150 million as of June and 30 percent year over year growth of total time spent in the second quarter of 2018,\u201d Chung added. He estimated Baidu's daily revenue could reach \u00a560 million ($9 million) by the end of this year, about double from last year. He increased the forecast for news feed revenue to \u00a514.1 billion in 2018 and \u00a522.6 billion in 2019, from the previous forecast of \u00a512.0 billion and \u00a519.6 billion, respectively. Shares rose 3.6 percent Monday following the KeyBanc report, contributing to an 11.3-percent climb since January. Baidu is expected to report second-quarter earnings on July 26.

In March, Trump first proposed steel and aluminum tariffs to correct what he deemed were unfair trading practices. The tariffs went into against Canada, Mexico and the European Union on June 1. Since then Mexico, Canada and the EU have also issued retaliatory tariffs of their own, targeting items such as agriculture products, steel, motorcycle and spirits. At midnight Washington time on Friday, 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect. China said it would immediately retaliate with tariffs of its own targeting agricultural products if the U.S. went ahead with its plans. \"I don't think [Trump] is going to back down,\" Gold said. \"I think he's going to dig this dangerous hole deeper.\" Meanwhile, the stock market has been on edge as the U.S. prepares to implement the tariffs. Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a global economics firm, said that Trump has gone \"a step too far\" trying to renegotiate long-standing trade policies and said escalating tensions with China could lead to supply chain disruptions, stock market effects, business uncertainty and reduced private sector confidence. \"U.S. activity is probably peaking in the second quarter and we\u2019re in an environment of slowing economic momentum, in which these tariffs are going to have an outright larger impact on the economy,\" Daco said Thursday on \"Power Lunch.\" Kevin Lemarque | Reuters President Donald Trump particiaptes in a rally for South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster in West Columbia, South Carolina, U.S., June 25, 2018. Typically representatives from each country would get together during trade disputes and negotiate \"creative solutions,\" Gold said. But that may not be possible with the current tariffs because they do not follow World Trade Organization's rules. \"When we take WTO illegal actions, that\u2019s something other countries won\u2019t negotiate with,\" Gold said. \"They\u2019ll put their foot down and just retaliate.\" The WTO could not be reached for immediate comment. \"The idea that when laissez faire policies that the United States tends to have confront state capitalist policies that China has, we know that the United States loses,\" Beth Baltzan, founder of American Phoenix Trade Advisory Services and formerly of the

9 July 2018 | 02:57 The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs might hurt the car and truck industry more than help, auto industry veteran Jim Press told CNBC. \u201cThe reality is that tariffs normally don\u2019t go away once they\u2019re enacted,\u201d Jim Press said on \u201cClosing Bell\u201d Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a negotiating tactic. And it causes a great deal of uncertainty in investment decisions, production decisions, design of product. It\u2019s a very difficult situation for the auto companies.\u201d U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EST on Friday. China immediately implemented retaliatory tariffs on its own. Beijing called it the \"biggest trade war in economic history.\" The Chinese tariffs will impact a number of American sectors, including agricultural products and autos. Now, vehicles built in the U.S. and sold overseas are subject to tariffs of up to 40 percent. Vehicles made in China and sold in the U.S., however, pay only a 25 percent tariff. In addition, China imports fewer cars to the U.S. than the other way around. The U.S. exported 267,000 autos to China last year, and has a trade surplus of $6.4 billion in the auto sector with China. \"The reality of our cars going to China, we don't make the kinds of vehicles that the Chinese would be using on their roads with their fuel economy,\" said Press, who is now president of RML Automotive. The move left many wondering how automobile manufacturers in the U.S. will cope with higher prices. Mercedes-Benz, which builds SUVs in Alabama, has not said yet how it will address the issue. BMW, however, said the tariffs would affect retail prices of models shipped out of South Carolina to China. Tesla also said in a note to consumers in China that they should expect higher prices. Press, who spent more than four decades in the auto industry, including tenures at Toyota, Ford Motor Company, General Motors and Chevrolet, as well as serving as co-president and vice chairman of Chrysler, said nothing good comes out of trade wars. \"The outcomes are normally bad,\" he said. \"In this case, it's really not merited based on the current situation in the U.S. auto industry. But it is perhaps a political effort to try and put pressure on China. I don't see how that's going to help American consumers.\" Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images A worker secures the wheels of an Hyundai Accent vehicle onto the back of a transporter truck during loading ahead of distribution at the Hyundai Motors automobile plant in St Petersburg, Russia. President Donald Trump first proposed tariffs last March in an effort to fix what he deemed unfair trading practices and help both American consumers and business owners. Tariffs against Canada, Mexico and the European Union went into effect on June 1. Since then, Mexico, Canada and the European Union have issued retaliatory tariffs of their own, targeting items such as agricultural products, steel, motorcycles and spirits. \u201cObviously, free and fair trade is the objective,\u201d Press said. \u201cAnd having zero tariffs is an outcome that\u2019s appealing. But there may be a better way to get there than starting with the nuclear option.\u201d \u2014 CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report.

Xiaomi, established only in 2010, is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer by producing low-priced devices that have drawn comparisons \u2014 favorable and accusatory \u2014 to the iPhone. But Beijing-based Xiaomi now faces a reality check after the relative low pricing of its Hong Kong initial public offering and the delay of its plan to become the first company to offer China Depository Receipts. China came up with the idea for CDRs as a vehicle to entice the country\u2019s technology giants \u2014 many having listed overseas \u2014 to offer a form of equity in the domestic stock markets, allowing local investors to get involved in the sector\u2019s growth. The concept is broadly similar to that of American depository receipts, which allow for U.S. markets to trade assets representing shares in foreign firms. CDRs are seen as important in part because they offer Chinese companies the chance to raise even more funds by tapping the domestic market. The IPO was priced on Friday at 17 Hong Kong dollars ($2.17) per share, with Xiaomi raising $4.7 billion. It had earlier set a range of HK$17 to HK$22 for the approximately 2.18 billion shares on offer. That transaction gives the company a reported valuation of about $54 billion, well below the initially hoped for $100 billion. Trading starts in Hong Kong on Monday. Analysts cite a range of factors for the relatively weak pricing, such as the Chinese CDR delay and recent negative investor sentiment toward global equities, including recent stock market downturns in China and Hong Kong, amid trade war fears between the United States and China. Some, however, say the market concluded that Xiaomi has been overhyped. \u201cHonestly, Xiaomi is not an internet company,\u201d said Dickie Wong, executive director for research at Kingston Financial in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hardware company,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d The key question Xiaomi says it sees itself differently. Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and CEO, in an open letter included in the IPO prospectus released last month, said Xiaomi sought to be the \u201ccoolest\u201d and manufacture \u201camazing products,\u201d calling it an \u201cinnovation-driven internet company.\u201d And while its phones have received positive reviews and its \u201cInternet of Things\u201d platform of more than 100 million connected devices is popular, Xiaomi\u2019s business is largely driven by its home market and fast growth in India. The company does not sell phones in the U.S., but its head of international business, Wang Xiang, has said that may change. Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images A Xiaomi smartphones sits inside one of its stores. \"We always look seriously at the U.S. market. The U.S. market is very important to us, but we are very, very carefully building our resources to serve the U.S. consumer,\" he told CNBC earlier this year. Focusing on other markets, however, means the company has avoided the ire of the US government, which has taken a stern attitude on national security and sanctions grounds toward Chinese companies, including Xiaomi rivals Huawei and ZTE. Analysts say Xiaomi\u2019s future rests on diversification. Lei has publicly vowed that net profit margin in its mainstay hardware will never exceed 5 percent, a bold promise that means new revenue streams are necessary for the company to grow. \u201cThe key question for Xiaomi is how fast they can change their business model to target something more high revenue,\u201d Kitty Fok, managing director for consultant IDC in China, told CNBC. Fok, who said Xiaomi is already investing in semiconductors, added that it would do well to focus on the more lucrative area of selling to businesses rather than just consumers \u2014 as well as artificial intelligence. Analysts still expect Xiaomi to eventually offer CDRs, but they are divided on when that will happen. Some see it as early as the next few months and others project it won\u2019t start until next year. In fact, some said Xiaomi's initial focus on Hong Kong is a smart move. \u201cThe mainland market has been keen to protect public investor interests,\u201d Nomura said in a report, referencing the regulatory \u201churdles\u201d Xiaomi encountered there. Hong Kong investors, meanwhile, watch performance and ultimately \u201coffer a fair value over time.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage":

downtown Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2016. Cleveland has more than one reason to mourn LeBron James' departure from the Cavaliers. While losing the four-time MVP could hurt its chances at another NBA trophy, it also could also dampen what's currently a bustling economy around the Quicken Loans Arena. James\u2019 management group announced Sunday that the three-time NBA champion is signing a four-year, $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. The first-round NBA draft pick spent his first seven seasons in Cleveland, joined the Miami Heat in 2010 and made a dramatic return to Cleveland in 2014. \u201cNo doubt [James] was a bright light to bring in people to the Q\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, regional economist at Kleinhenz & Associates and adjunct professor at Case Western Reserve University, using the arena's nickname. \u201cIt will have a local effect but we\u2019ll just have to work through it like we did the last time.\" Local hospitality Whichever city \u201cKing James\u201d has played for has historically seen a boost in restaurants and bars opening within a mile of the NBA stadium, and when James leaves, the opposite takes place, according to a 2017 Harvard Kennedy School study. During his time at the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, the total number of bars and restaurants within a mile of those stadiums rose by an aggregate 13 percent, while total employment rose about 23.5 percent, the study found. \u201cAround the stadium, there are clear and direct local spillovers,\u201d Stan Veuger, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the study told CNBC. \u201cThis is what you would expect when the Cavs become twice as good.\u201d if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":579,\"200\":415,\"300\":375,\"400\":375,\"500\":375,\"700\":333,\"800\":333,\"900\":333,\"1000\":333},window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-RRGdO\"),window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"RRGdO\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"RRGdO\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); When James played for Miami, there was a downward trend in the number of restaurants in Cleveland that coincided with an upward trend around the stadium in Miami. Likewise, when James returned to the Cavs, restaurants near Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena spiked while the number restaurants within a mile of the American Airlines Arena started to slide, according to the Harvard study. For a city like Los Angeles, Veuger expects less of a James-related bump. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t become the one big thing the city is known for,\" he said. \u201cThe Los Angeles metro area is an order of magnitude bigger, so relative to the size of the economy, you\u2019d see less of an impact locally.\" Attendance For attendance, though, Cleveland\u2019s loss already seems like a gain for Los Angeles. In less than 24 hours after the announcement that James would be soon wearing a Lakers jersey, StubHub said visits to its Los Angeles Lakers tickets page increased by 1,831 percent compared with the daily average of the previous 30 days. Compared with the same date last year, traffic on the website was 7,398 percent higher. Game attendance fell sharply the last time James announced his departure from Cleveland, which will have 41 regular season home games. Total attendance dropped 37 percent in the first two years James was gone from Cleveland, according to ESPN's NBA Attendance Report. According to StubHub, four of its top five seasons for Cavaliers ticket sales were during James\u2019s second stint on the team. Average ticket prices also increased roughly 80 percent after James\u2019 comeback, jumping to $107.90 from $60.03 the season before. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":532,\"200\":453,\"300\":427,\"400\":427,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-84syq\"),window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"84syq\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"84syq\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); \"The Q\" In 2016, the Cavaliers announced a $140 million project to renovate the downtown Quicken Loans Arena, known as the Q, which in part is being funded by a tax on ticket sales. The Cavs are extending their lease to 2034, and will pay $70 million and the balance being picked up by the county, a common practice in sports-arena financing. Last year the arena generated $47 million in state and local tax revenue, $17 million in tax revenue for the city of Cleveland, and $6 million in tax revenue for Cuyahoga County, a spokesman for the Cavs said, citing data from CSL, a consultant in the convention, sports and leisure industry. It also generated $177 million in direct spending and supported 3,700 jobs, he said. The spokesman declined to provide details about 2018-19 season Cavs ticket sales. Still, the venue hosts roughly 200 events per year, including the the Republican National Convention in July 2016. \"People from the greater Cleveland area go to Q and spend money,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, economics professor at Smith College and former sports industry consultant. \"There\u2019s a substitution effect\u2014 that\u2019s money they can now spend going to a local theater or Indians game.\" Hospitality The real economic toll on Cleveland could be a loss of money from tourists traveling to see one of the best players in the league. In 2015, Cleveland visitors spent $5.4 billion, with $1.3 billion in food and beverage sales alone, and recreation and entertainment brought in $1 billion, according to Destination Cleveland, the city's tourism bureau. That total amount jumped roughly 10 percent from 2013, which a spokeswoman said is not necessarily tied to James's return to the city's team. \"The $100 million difference between 2013 and 2015 in recreation & entertainment spending would likely include some relationships to the Cavs as LeBron was back in Cleveland in 2015,\" said Emily Lauer, a spokeswoman for Destination Cleveland, the city's tourism and convention bureau. She said that the $100 million increase cannot be entirely attributed to James's return, though. Going forward, Cleveland will have to work harder to attract travelers to the city to fill its increasing number of hotel rooms. Hotel data specialist STR count of hotel rooms has increased nearly 15 percent, to 24,141, since the end of 2013 through May 2018 and hotel. Those were in 206 hotels, up from 188 before James returned to the Cavaliers from Miami in 2014, and after the city hosted the Republican National Convention two years ago. Occupancy in those rooms fell 2.4 percent last year but is up 3.2 percent through May, according to STR. More passengers have been flying to and from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, too. The airport suffered from a decline in passenger traffic in 2014 after United Airlines stopped using the airport as a hub following its 2010 merger with Continental Airlines, but traffic has rebounded to more than 9.1 million passengers last year, the most since 2011, after U.S. and international airlines added service. Parking, concession revenue and aircraft landing fees generate revenue for airports. Franchise value James's return to Cleveland also boosted the value of the Cavaliers franchise. Since he rejoined the team in 2014, its value has more than doubled, to $1.3 billion this year from $515 million, according to data from Forbes. The Cavs first topped the $1 billion mark in 2016, when it won its first \u2014 and only \u2014 NBA championship. While plenty of factors go into the value of a sports franchise \u2014 one key is cash flow, which could be dampened if ticket sales slip with James' departure. \u201cYou look at a company's\u2019 valuation, it\u2019s on the cash flow and to what extent it could be sold to somebody,\u201d said Kleinhenz, who is also chief economist at the National Retail Federation. \u201cCertainly, the attendance would be a factor.\u201d A diverse economy Despite James's popularity, the city has other industries, like insurance, banking, technology and health care, including its crown jewel \u2014 the Cleveland Clinic. Municipal bond analysts don't appear too worried, for now. Jane Ridley, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings said she is waiting to see whether there is an effect on the city's revenue, but it won't happen overnight. The agency has an investment grade rating on Cleveland's general obligation debt, she said, adding that a decline in property tax revenue would likely have a bigger impact than James's departure. Moody's Investor Service said the city's stable A1 rating didn't change when James returned to the Cavaliers in 2014 and that there's not enough reason to change it upon James's departure. \u201cCleveland and Cuyahoga County both have diverse economies anchored by large employers which should largely mitigate any shock that perhaps their most marketable athlete leaving the city would create,\" said Matthew Wong, director at Fitch Ratings. \u201cCleveland\u2019s revenue growth will continue to trend lower than national inflation while Cuyahoga County\u2019s revenue growth remains in line, neither of which will change dramatically with LeBron James leaving Cleveland.\u201d Mark Rosentraub, professor of sports management at University of Michigan, said that \"you could see a small hit to the city of Cleveland, but it\u2019s such a small number, most of the spending from basketball will be spent on other stuff. \"Cleveland is going to survive. Sports fans just might not be as happy.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/01/18/103312369-GettyImages-455053616.jpg?v=1536080128", "time": "2018-07-06T10:25:15-0400", "author": "Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "The Commerce Department said the trade deficit, the gap between what the U.S. exports and what it imports from foreign countries, was $43.1 billion for the month of May, down 6.6 percent from April.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/us-trade-deficit-drops-to-smallest-size-since-2016-election.html", "title": "US trade deficit drops to smallest since before 2016 election", "keywords": [{"term": "Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Seagirt Marine Terminal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Port of Baltimore", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "monthly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Commerce Department", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$43.1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the month of May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "6.6 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "April", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1.9 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the previous month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$215.3 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "0.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "$258.4 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "October 2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "a month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three consecutive months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "year over year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the same day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$34 billion", "category": "MONEY"}], "body": " Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images A spotter lines up a truck before a container is loaded from a ship in the Seagirt Marine Terminal at the Port of Baltimore.

In other words, he\u2019s concerned tariffs will result in higher inflation, which will push the Federal Reserve to continue its tightening or even pick up the pace of interest rate hikes. Minerd spoke with CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d after tweeting earlier in the day that the market rally was the \u201clast hurrah\u201d and \u201cinvestors should sell now.\u201d Minerd tweet Stocks appeared to shake off trade fears on Monday, closing sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied more than 300 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent. The latest trade salvos came on Friday, when President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods took effect. China then fired back with retaliatory tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork. Trump also expects to soon add a further $16 billion in tariffs and will consider up to hundreds of billions of dollars more in duties. Meanwhile, the U.S. has also placed duties on steel and aluminium from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, key allies. They have responded with retaliatory measures. Trump has also threatened to place tariffs on autos imported from the EU. Autos make up about 6 percent of the consumer price index, Minerd said. And if there were a 25 percent tariff on them, with 100 percent pass through, it would add 1.5 percent to inflation, he said. \u201cPeople are being confused by the idea that if you place a tariff on a foreign good that somehow that doesn\u2019t pass through to domestic consumer,\u201d he noted. However, when duties were imposed on washing machines earlier this year, prices jumped by 17 percent, Minerd added. That said, he thinks the market tends to react slowly to change, and this is a seasonally strong time for the market, he added. But in the end, he thinks investors will be \u201cconfronted with cold water in the face.\u201d \u201cThis could go in through the rest of the summer before we start to see some sort of a correction occur in September or October.\u201d This isn\u2019t Minerd\u2019s first warning about the stock market. In March, he told clients the market is on a \u201ccollision course with disaster.\u201d He expects the worst of the damage to start in 2019 and 2020, predicting a sharp recession and 40 percent decline in stocks.

The credit card firm has been testing cards with in-built fingerprint scanners, which are used to verify customers' identities. This is intended to replace the use of passwords and speed-up the process of making payments online and contactless transactions in-store. A spokesperson for the company confirmed to CNBC on Monday that it was speaking with banks about launching the biometric cards. \u201cThe use of passwords to authenticate someone is woefully outdated, with consumers forgetting them and retailers facing abandoned shopping baskets,\u201d said Ajay Bhalla, president of global enterprise risk and security at Mastercard. \u201cIn payments technology, this is something we\u2019re closing in on as we move from cash to card, password to thumbprint, and beyond to innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence. It\u2019s far easier to authenticate with a thumbprint or a selfie, and it\u2019s safer too.\u201d The push toward biometrics echoes a wider change happening in the payments industry right now. In January, the European Union implemented the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), a regulation aimed at speeding up transactions and giving third-party firms access to banks\u2019 customer data so that they can build better products. Under the new rules, customers are required to confirm their identity every five times after they have made a contactless payment. Mastercard said the biometric tech is currently being trialed in South Africa. Visa \u2014 Mastercard's main rival \u2014 is also testing biometric cards in Cyprus. PSD2 has put banks and major financial services providers under intense pressure to improve their digital capability and open up their data to third-party developers. Banks are treasure troves when it comes to financial data, compiling huge amounts on a daily basis. Moving towards biometric forms of payment like fingerprint sensors and eye-scanning tech \u2014 TSB, for instance, said last year it wants to be the first European bank to roll out iris authentication \u2014 to make payments simpler is also expected to improve financial security and tackle fraud.

All tallied, that's $224 billion in bank capital given away over nine quarters. If the banks had kept that $224 billion, it could have supported the addition of $2.8 trillion in bank assets, assuming that money was leveraged 12.5 times. Further, a little more than half of it, around $1.5 trillion, could have been used to make new loans. These loans could have supported the building of infrastructure in the United States. Or, the money could have been used to provide the housing needed to meet the growing demand among the surging 25-to-44-year-old population. The loans could have been used to support the expansion of small businesses. These loans could have increased the money supply and the growth in gross national product. Bank managements argue that this type of reasoning is fallacious. They say that stockholders can make better use of the money than the banks can. They argue that they have excess capital. Moreover, they believe that the prices of bank stocks will rise faster if they pay out all of their earnings to shareholders. Let\u2019s look at these arguments, starting with the last one first. 1. Stock Prices In 2017, big banks paid out more money to shareholders than ever before ($100 billion). The thought was that this would increase bank stock prices in 2018, but that hasn't happened. Year-to-date in 2018, shares of the four biggest banks have fallen 6.5 percent; shares of the 10 big regionals are down 3.5 percent; the two investment banks have dropped 11.9 percent and the three trust banks are down 1.6 percent. Furthermore, virtually every one of these stocks has fallen almost every day since the big banks announced their next round of record payouts 10 days ago. 2. Excess Capital Here\u2019s another surprise: There is no such concept as excess capital in a bank. The term is derived from the government bureaucracy. If a bank has more capital than is needed to protect its safety and soundness, someone decided that the additional capital is \"excess capital.\" From an economic sense, it is not excess. Every dime of that money would be invested in obtaining additional profit. If the money is given away, the profits associated with those funds are lost, as is the ability to leverage the bank's balance sheet. The secular earnings growth rate of the bank declines. These are simple facts. 3. Use of Funds In making these big shareholder payouts, the boards of directors of the banks are saying shareholders have a greater opportunity to make use of the additional bank capital than the banks do. I am not sure how one calculates this. Certainly, the drop in the banks' share prices after last year's payouts would indicate it was not the highest use of these funds. Additionally, even though interest rates are high and going higher, they are still well below bank returns on equity. Plus, consumer spending seems to be driven more by having a job and an increased paycheck than obtaining a dividend from a bank stock \u2013 one that is declining in value. Bank boards seem to be arguing that they do not know how to get a higher return on the funds they hold, and that they are stymied when it comes to how to increase bank revenue. So they are willing to harm the bank\u2019s future growth rate by giving away the bank\u2019s money rather than developing innovative uses for the funds that they hold. If the directors are that confused as to how to grow the institution they monitor, then it is time for them to leave. It is time for activist investors to replace them. While the big banks were giving away $224 billion, 298 of America\u2019s small regional and community banks added $18 billion in capital to their balance sheets. Unlike their larger counterparts, these banks were growing their balance sheets and loan portfolios. Plus, in 2018, their stock prices were rising. Core regional bank stocks are up 7.7 percent year-to-date. Shares of small regionals are up 0.2 percent, community banks are up 5.0 percent and small community banks are up 8.0 percent. These companies are not stuck with a lack of ideas or innovation.

The company said the size of its portfolio grew to 308 billion Singapore dollars ($235 billion) in the year ended March 31, representing a 12 percent increase year-over-year in local currency terms. In the past year, the company made investments worth 29 billion Singapore dollars and divested 16 billion Singapore dollars. Growth in its portfolio size came on the back of an 18 percent year-over-year increase in MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index in the year to March, while Singapore's main index rose 8 per cent. But Temasek warned that the current financial year is shaping up to be a challenging one, given rising trade and geopolitical tensions. Some monetary and financial stresses are also observed in a number of key economies, the company said. \u201cWe are tempering our investment pace in the year ahead, but remain open to intrinsically investable opportunities, including counter-cyclical ones,\u201d Lim Boon Heng, Temasek\u2019s chairman, wrote in the company annual report that was released on Tuesday. In the past year, a number of companies that Temasek has a stake in have experienced surges in their share prices. Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank saw shares jumped 42 percent, while in Hong Kong, China Construction Bank Corp and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China rose 29 percent and over 32 percent, respectively. Temasek \u2014 an active equity investor \u2014 is owned by the government of Singapore, a tiny but wealthy Southeast Asian nation. Temasek, which invested mainly in Singapore companies in its early days, have turned into a global player in recent years. More than 70 percent of the company\u2019s portfolio exposure is now outside its home country and spreading across other Asian nations, Europe and the Americas. It has also increased its stake in start-ups. Last month, Temasek and Singapore state fund GIC were among the main investors in a $14 billion fundraising by China\u2019s Ant Financial \u2013 a spin-off from technology giant Alibaba. The investor also backed Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek and led a $502 million investment in Magic Leap, a U.S. startup developing augmented reality tech products. The approach to focus on sectors such as technology, life sciences and non-bank financial services is one that\u2019s likely to stay, according to Temasek. \u201cThis on-going active investment stance is focused on solutions for a better, smarter and more connected world over the medium to long term,\u201d Lee Theng Kiat, executive director and chief executive of Temasek International, said in a statement. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.

Investors should sell Chipotle Mexican Grill shares given a lack of clear innovation in the near-term, according to one analyst, and limit any upside for the already recovered stock. Mizuho downgraded the burrito chain\u2019s stock to underperform from neutral Tuesday, encouraging clients to curb exposure until it\u2019s clear chief executive Brian Niccol can replicate the success he had at Taco Bell. \u201cWhile it is our view that Niccol is the best choice to lead Chipotle from here, in the absence of clear catalysts that can justify significant earnings upside, we're compelled to recommend investors reduce their risk,\u201d analyst Jeremy Scott said in a note Tuesday. \u201cAfter an 80 percent run since Niccol's appointment as CEO, we believe the stock currently prices in an aggressive recovery in both comps and margins.\u201d Chipotle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Niccol, whose appointment as Chipotle CEO earlier this year caused a one-day spike in the company\u2019s stock, arrived at company fresh from three years at the helm of Taco Bell. Many in the Chipotle board room hope the new executive can recapture millennial diners with inventive menu options and digital innovation, having previously introduced mobile ordering and payment across Taco Bell\u2019s 7,000 locations in the U.S. Much of that hope may already be reflected in the stock\u2019s 80 percent rally since Niccol\u2019s appointment, Mizuho\u2019s Scott argued, with new management facing a tough research and development process and a customer base still wary after the company\u2019s \u201cjumpy\u201d roll-out of queso last year. \u201cWe're certainly not downplaying Niccol's impressive track record in his three years leading Taco Bell, where much of his success can be attributed to his embrace of experimentation,\u201d Scott added. \u201cHowever, a ramp in innovation will likely raise concerns around long-term margins due to incremental investment in labor, training, marketing and technology upgrades.\u201d Scott did note the company\u2019s plans to launch a loyalty program in 2019 and that management has a temporary \u201chall pass\u201d with investors on comparable sales and profit margins at least through 2018, two positive factors that could pose a risk to his downgrade. He also added that there are \u201cfew clear short-term downside catalysts\u201d and that the new management could still surprise Wall Street with novel ideas and a strong marketing campaign.

That gives him hope the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest rate hikes, which he sees as the most important factor facing the stock market. \u201cIt really means there\u2019s a chance the Fed is not going to raise four times this year and we\u2019re not going to squeeze on labor supply,\u201d he said Monday on \u201cClosing Bell.\" That said, he\u2019d like to see another month of data to convince him the central bank may only implement three rate increases, instead of the four he has been predicting. \u201cI\u2019m still very, very cautious, but I was encouraged by Friday,\u201d he added. The United States added 213,000 jobs in June, better than the 195,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4 percent, due to the rise in the labor force participation rate. According to the government report, 601,000 people came off the sidelines and re-entered the work force. \u201cWe need those people that have not been involved in the labor force to come in and take that pressure off. We can grow quickly then without the Fed raising rates too much,\u201d Siegel said. A trade war is another factor for stocks, but the market sees only a 10 percent probability of that happening, he added. \u201cIf it heats up, wow. That\u2019s a lot of downside.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods took effect on Friday. China then fired back with retaliatory tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork. Trump also expects to soon add a further $16 billion in tariffs and will consider up to hundreds of billions of dollars more in duties. Meanwhile, the U.S. has also placed duties on steel and aluminium from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, key allies. They have responded with retaliatory measures. While it\u2019s tough to predict what Trump will ultimately do, Siegel said he thinks the president will stop short of making it a real problem for the world economy. \u201cNo president has had more tweets about enjoying a good stock market than Donald Trump. Well, if he wants to continue to enjoy a good stock market he cannot bring this trade war upon us all,\u201d he said. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Earlier this year, Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked in what was believed to be the largest digital currency heist of all time. Hundreds of millions of NEM tokens, worth more than $530 million in total at the time, were stolen. Cases like this echo one of the most notable examples of cryptocurrency being stolen. In 2014, the now infamous exchange Mt. Gox admitted that $480 million in bitcoins had gone missing. The collapse of Mt. Gox was seen as a test for bitcoin, which roared to a record high near $20,000 last year but has pulled back significantly since.

Morgan. The firm reiterated its overweight rating for the social media company\u2019s stock, downplaying the impact of Twitter pruning fake accounts. On Friday after the market close the Washington Post reported Twitter was ramping up its efforts in closing fake accounts. The article stated about 70 million accounts were suspended in May and June, with a similar pace continuing in July. Shares of Twitter closed down 5.4 percent Monday. \u201cOverall, we believe there is confusion around these numbers, the correlation to reported metrics is misunderstood, and the sell-off is overdone. We\u2019d be taking advantage of the weakness and recommend buying Twitter shares,\u201d analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients Monday. Twitter shares rose 1 percent on Tuesday after the report. The analyst reaffirmed his $50 price target for Twitter shares, representing 13 percent upside to Monday\u2019s close.

Pick, 49, will become head of the institutional securities group, reporting to Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher, according to a Tuesday memo from Gorman and Kelleher. The division includes the investment banking and trading businesses and typically accounts for roughly half of the New York-based firm\u2019s revenue. \"Broadening the experience and skill sets of our senior leaders is a critical component of sustaining Morgan Stanley\u2019s future success,\" Gorman and Kelleher said in the memo. \"Leading ISG is a natural next step\" for Pick, according to the memo. Pick, a Morgan Stanley veteran who started in the firm\u2019s investment bank, has been steadily adding responsibilities. As head of equities trading, he helped Morgan Stanley return to a No. 1 ranking after the financial crisis damaged its business. He then added oversight of a struggling fixed income division and has been credited with helping turn it around. With the addition of investment banking, Pick has oversight of what has historically been the firm\u2019s marquee operations. Gorman isn't leaving anytime soon. In 2016, amid a management overhaul that included elevating Kelleher to president, the firm said Gorman was planning to lead Morgan Stanley for at least another five years. The bank also named Franck Petitgas, who had been co-head of investment banking since 2013, the new head of its international operations. Susie Huang was named co-head of investment banking with Mark Eichorn. Given Pick\u2019s increasing responsibilities, he named a trio of executives to run the firm\u2019s equities trading division. Gokul Laroia, David Russell and Alan Thomas will be global co-heads of the business, Pick said in a Tuesday memo.

Cyclical sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary tend to perform better during periods of growth, when investors are more willing to take on risk. Now Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson and his team said it's time for those high-flying sectors to take a backseat to defensive sectors such as utilities, where business is less affected by fluctuations in economic growth. Tech is the best performer in the S&P 500 so far this year, up more than 12.5 percent. \"We suspect it will not be immune from the changing attitudes toward risk assets we are seeing across markets and think the sector may have benefitted from a false sense of security the past few months,\" Wilson said in a report. He noted that earnings growth is already priced in, relative valuation is elevated and the industry is sensitive to growing trade tensions since it is one of the most dependent on China by revenues. Semiconductors, which tend to lead the performance of cyclical sectors, have \"meaningfully underperformed\" technology in the last few months, Wilson pointed out. Source: Morgan Stanley Research Overall, \"we think there is a growing probability that the market is now discounting at least 2 of our 3 necessary conditions for sustained defensive leadership \u2014 peaking y/y earnings growth and a top in the 10 Year Treasury Yield,\" the report said. The final condition, which is an inverted yield curve between the 10-year and the 2-year Treasuries, is just 28 basis points from happening, and the gap between the two is narrowing quickly, it added. \"Waiting for an 'engraved invitation' is never a good idea when anticipating leadership changes.\" On Monday, Wilson downgraded small-cap stocks to equal weight based on the view the group has run too far ahead of itself. He also upgraded defensive sectors consumer staples and telecom services to equal weight from underweight. Morgan Stanley upgraded utilities to overweight on June 18. Since then, the sector has gained 6.3 percent as the top performer in the S&P 500. June marked the first month \"showing broad and consistent performance from the defensive sectors,\" the report said. \"We think this is likely to continue and could portend a more difficult market environment overall as we enter the seasonally worst time of the year.\" Wilson pointed out the S&P 500 typically trades poorly in July and August of midterm election years. \"Given the highly uncertain nature of this year's election, we suspect this year could prove to be worse than average,\" he said. Source: Morgan Stanley Research. As of July 5, 2018. Stocks rose Monday morning after Friday's better-than-expected employment report. Wilson maintained his 12-month S&P 500 target of 2,750, but expects the index could rise to 2,800 to 2,825 in the near term, or up at least 1.5 percent from Friday's close. \"Our suspicion is that this rally may prove to be a bull trap that provides the perfect opportunity to position more defensively. ... We think [the jobs report] will likely encourage the Fed to continue to tighten and may encourage the administration to continue to take a strong stance on trade issues,\" he said. \"After all, economic data like this suggests the trade policies are successful. Neither of these potential actions is good for equity markets in our view.\" The U.S. and China each implemented tariffs Friday on $34 billion worth of imports from the other country.

The most obvious choice is paper straws, but they cost a lot more. \"You\u2019re looking at maybe ten times the cost,\" Adam Merran, CEO of PacknWood, a food service products company, told CNBC on \"Closing Bell\" Monday. \"If you buy a paper straw, it\u2019s about two cents and a half,\" he said. Plastic straws cost about a half-cent. But Merran, whose company distributes paper straws \u2014using recyclable and organic materials \u2014 to coffee shops, Las Vegas casinos and large stadiums like Madison Square Garden, said it's all about perspective. \"You go from something that is very, very, very cheap, to something that is still actually cheap,\" he said. Starbucks was just one of many chains to recently announce that it would go withoutsingle-use plastic straws by 2020. Bon Appetit Management Company, a food service management company that services about 1,000 locations around the nation, also recently announced it would stop using plastic straws in facilities that it manages. However, Starbucks, in lieu of paper straws \u2014 which many customers have complained lose their shape too fast \u2014 said it will replace plastic straws with a recyclable sippy cup-type lid. \"Any green solution is a solution,\" Merran said.

They come in a box of 144 and can be purchased for under $10. He said other alternatives include re-usable straws, where customers clean their straws at home and bring them back each time they dine out, similar to a to-go mug. As for how long the paper straws last after being inserted into liquid, Merran said it depends on the beverage and temperature. \"It should hold for about the time for you to [finish the] drink,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to become a little soggy, but you can still drink from it.

The firm lowered its rating to hold from buy for eBay shares, predicting the additional tax compliance requirements will drive sellers away from the online auction platform. Last month the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have the right to collect taxes on ecommerce sales whether or not the retailer has a physical presence in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re downgrading EBAY\u2026 to reflect anticipated headwinds from on-going changes to tax laws in the US following SCOTUS\u2019 decision to reverse a 1992 ecommerce precedent, and prospects for similar headwinds overseas,\u201d analyst Youssef Squali said in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cWhile this is not a call on 2Q18 results, we believe these changes increase the likelihood of a slowdown in GMV growth in FY19 and beyond, reversing recent improvements in this metric and Street expectations for more.\u201d EBay shares are down 1.7 percent Tuesday after the report. Squali reduced his price target to $40 from $48 for eBay shares. The new target is 5.5 percent higher than Monday\u2019s closing price.

He believes the \u201cmajority\u201d of sellers on the platform do not collect taxes. \u201cLogistically, we believe this is a daunting task for eBay as sellers would need to provide eBay with a social security or federal tax ID number, and report their profits to the IRS,\u201d he said. \u201cThis paperwork requirement is likely to add substantial friction into the system, potentially driving many sellers away from the eBay platform.\u201d The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn is in a rut. His Greenlight Capital fund fell 7.7 percent in June and was down nearly 19 percent for the first half of the year, according to a performance update seen by CNBC. At the same time, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 percent. The down-on-his-luck investor may take comfort in history, however. Fellow value-style champion Julian Robertson of Tiger Management had his own high-profile stumble during the momentum-driven tech stock surge of 1999 and 2000, a period that preceded a big shift back to value investing. show chapters Investors flee from Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund 10:11 AM ET Wed, 11 July 2018 | 03:40 That could mean value investing, which has been in the doldrums during the current strong run-up in tech stocks, could be about to come back in style. Investors just have to hang in there long enough. Robert Buckland of Citi Research said in a note to clients on Wednesday that as a bull market runs its course, its winning bets typically narrow to high-growth and momentum stocks, a shift he saw in the current market in February. \"This usually favors growth and momentum trades and has produced bubbles in the past,\" he wrote. \"These can be career-threatening for value managers.\u201d Four out of Greenlight's five-largest disclosed positions, revealed in the first-quarter investor letter, are down through the end of June. Among them, Brighthouse Financial leads with a 30 percent drop. And Einhorn's bets against high-flying technology and growth stocks, the so-called the bubble basket, have backfired on him. The weak year-to-date return followed a meager 1.6 percent gain in 2017 versus a 19.4 percent gain for the S&P 500, according to an investor letter. Greenlight did not respond to a request for comment. Einhorn isn't alone among out-of-favor value investors. The S&P 500 Growth index rose 6.6 percent in the first half of this year, while the S&P 500 Value index declined 3.4 percent. And the market still favors big tech stocks. Amazon was up 45 percent, Netflix had gained 104 percent and Tesla was up 10 percent so far this year through June. All are in the \"bubble basket\" of stocks Einhorn's Greenlight has bet against. If the investor didn't exit those positions, the same basket of stocks likely contributed to the fund's losses this year. Earlier this year, Einhorn expressed confidence in his fund's stock positions. \"We believe our investment theses remain intact. Despite recent results, our portfolio should perform well over time,\" Einhorn said in a April 3 letter to clients. \"To some extent, this quarter's result stems from the continued extreme outperformance of growth over value.\" While Einhorn waits for a shift back to a less extreme imbalance of growth and value, his struggles are reminiscent of those experienced by the most successful value-oriented hedge fund of the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management posted annual returns of more than 30 percent for 18 years and reached assets under management of more than $20 billion. But then the hedge fund faltered as value stocks went out of favor and internet stocks boomed. Tiger lost 19 percent in 1999, the same year that earlier generation of technology stocks soared. But Robertson did not wait it out. As investors withdrew $7.7 billion from Tiger, Robertson decided to close his firm after a nearly 15 percent drop in the first two months of 2000. \u201cThe result of the demise of value investing and investor withdrawals has been financial erosion, stressful to us all,\" Robertson wrote in an investor letter on March 30, 2000. \"And there is no real indication that a quick end is in sight.\" Robertson said his success had been his steady commitment to buying the best stocks and shorting the worst. \"In a rational environment, this strategy functions well. But in an irrational market, where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not count for much.\" Tiger\u2019s closure was right around the peak of the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, which would turn quickly and drop 46 percent from April to year-end 2000. When that dot-com bubble burst, value stocks came back into fashion. From April 2000 to year-end 2003, the S&P 500 Value index outperformed the S&P 500 Growth index by 30 percentage points. History may repeat itself.

The percentage of small companies not able to fill open positions hit 36 percent in June, according to the NFIB Research Center, matching the survey's record high set in November 2000. (The data goes back to 1973.) \u201cLabor markets are very tight, for both skilled and unskilled workers,\u201d wrote William Dunkelberg and Holly Wade, chief economist and director of research at NFIB, respectively. \u201cMore firms are looking for workers than workers looking for a job. And the hiring strength is in industries that pay well: construction, manufacturing, and financial services.\u201d Source: \"NFIB Small Business Economic Trends,\" July 2018. NFIB Research Center. The difficulty in finding qualified workers comes at a time when small business optimism is booming with the survey's main index posting its sixth highest reading ever. For the month of June, the index came in at 107.2, down 0.6 from May. Since December 2016, the index has averaged an \"unprecedented\" 105.4, well above the 45-year average of 98 and rivaling the all-time high of 108 in July 1983, the researchers said. The findings represent yet another indication that the U.S. labor market is either at or beyond full employment following Friday\u2019s Department of Labor report on the employment situation. The monthly publication showed that the economy added 213,000 jobs last month, well ahead of expectations and maintaining the trend of hot job creation. The unemployment rate \u2013 which measures the number of people without a job but seeking work against the total number of people in the labor force \u2013 ticked upward to 4 percent as the competitive labor market attracted people off the sidelines. \u201cSmall business owners continue to report astounding optimism as they celebrate strong sales, the creation of jobs, and more profits,\u201d said NFIB chief executive Juanita Duggan. \u201cThe first six months of the year have been very good to small business thanks to tax cuts, regulatory reform, and policies that help them grow.\u201d The organization found in their most recent report that 21 percent of small business owners cited trouble finding qualified workers as the single most important business problem. According to July's Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) published Tuesday, there were 6.6 million open positions in May, more than the 6.1 million unemployed persons in during the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under normal circumstances, the mismatch would be galvanizing higher wages. However, average hourly earnings rose just 2.7 percent annualized in June, up two-tenths of a point from May.

A handful of names in the S&P 500 are already 20 percent above what analysts believe they'll be worth over the next one year. Case in point: Netflix shares are 13 percent above the average Wall Street analyst price target thanks to a gain of 116 percent since January.

Morgan Chase's Doug Anmuth pause, with the analyst writing Wednesday that the rapid appreciation in the price of Netflix shares make the online video steamer less attractive from a valuation vantage. While he kept his rating at a bullish overweight, he warned that the stock has surpassed his December 2018 price target more than five months early. \u201cNetflix shares have traded through our $385 price target, and we continue to like the story and believe there is upside to our longer-term numbers, but we believe the risk-reward is more balanced heading into the second-quarter print,\u201d Anmuth told clients Wednesday. His current forecast \u2014 bumped up from $328 back in April \u2014 came when shares of the online video streamer hovered at $336, implying 14 percent upside at the time. The stock has since soared past that threshold, and closed Tuesday above $415; Anmuth\u2019s target now implies more than 7 percent downside. Netflix, which is set to report its latest financial numbers on Monday, is expected to add about 7 million subscribers, J.P. Morgan said, higher than the 6.2 million company management guided and the 6.27 million Amnuth predicts. While tech stocks have the led market over the past year, the disparity between analyst forecasts and recent performance isn't isolated to the sector. Athletic wear company Under Armour, for example, is up more than 50 percent so far this year at around $22.40, well above the average analyst price target of $16.91. The stock is bouncing off a 52-week low hit in November, when shares of Under Armour closed at $11.61.

This article was originally published on Medium. Last year, I got invited to a super-deluxe private resort to deliver a keynote speech to what I assumed would be a hundred or so investment bankers. It was by far the largest fee I had ever been offered for a talk \u2014 about half my annual professor\u2019s salary \u2014 all to deliver some insight on the subject of \u201cthe future of technology.\u201d I\u2019ve never liked talking about the future. The Q&A sessions always end up more like parlor games, where I\u2019m asked to opine on the latest technology buzzwords as if they were ticker symbols for potential investments: blockchain, 3D printing, CRISPR. The audiences are rarely interested in learning about these technologies or their potential impacts beyond the binary choice of whether or not to invest in them. But money talks, so I took the gig. After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys \u2014 yes, all men \u2014 from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own. They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern. Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, \u201cHow do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?\u201d \"For all their wealth and power, they don\u2019t believe they can affect the future.\" The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down. This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers \u2014 if that technology could be developed in time. That\u2019s when it hit me: At least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology. Taking their cue from Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Peter Thiel reversing the aging process, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape. There\u2019s nothing wrong with madly optimistic appraisals of how technology might benefit human society. But the current drive for a post-human utopia is something else. It\u2019s less a vision for the wholesale migration of humanity to a new a state of being than a quest to transcend all that is human: the body, interdependence, compassion, vulnerability, and complexity. As technology philosophers have been pointing out for years, now, the transhumanist vision too easily reduces all of reality to data, concluding that \u201chumans are nothing but information-processing objects.\u201d It\u2019s a reduction of human evolution to a video game that someone wins by finding the escape hatch and then letting a few of his BFFs come along for the ride. Will it be Musk, Bezos, Thiel\u2026Zuckerberg? These billionaires are the presumptive winners of the digital economy \u2014 the same survival-of-the-fittest business landscape that\u2019s fueling most of this speculation to begin with. show chapters 'The most important' thing Jeff Bezos is working on has hit another milestone 4:23 PM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 01:06 Of course, it wasn\u2019t always this way. There was a brief moment, in the early 1990s, when the digital future felt open-ended and up for our invention. Technology was becoming a playground for the counterculture, who saw in it the opportunity to create a more inclusive, distributed, and pro-human future. But established business interests only saw new potentials for the same old extraction, and too many technologists were seduced by unicorn IPOs. Digital futures became understood more like stock futures or cotton futures \u2014 something to predict and make bets on. So nearly every speech, article, study, documentary, or white paper was seen as relevant only insofar as it pointed to a ticker symbol. The future became less a thing we create through our present-day choices or hopes for humankind than a predestined scenario we bet on with our venture capital but arrive at passively. This freed everyone from the moral implications of their activities. Technology development became less a story of collective flourishing than personal survival. Worse, as I learned, to call attention to any of this was to unintentionally cast oneself as an enemy of the market or an anti-technology curmudgeon. So instead of considering the practical ethics of impoverishing and exploiting the many in the name of the few, most academics, journalists, and science-fiction writers instead considered much more abstract and fanciful conundrums: Is it fair for a stock trader to use smart drugs? Should children get implants for foreign languages? Do we want autonomous vehicles to prioritize the lives of pedestrians over those of its passengers? Should the first Mars colonies be run as democracies? Does changing my DNA undermine my identity? Should robots have rights? Asking these sorts of questions, while philosophically entertaining, is a poor substitute for wrestling with the real moral quandaries associated with unbridled technological development in the name of corporate capitalism. Digital platforms have turned an already exploitative and extractive marketplace (think Walmart) into an even more dehumanizing successor (think Amazon). Most of us became aware of these downsides in the form of automated jobs, the gig economy, and the demise of local retail. \"The future became less a thing we create through our present-day choices or hopes for humankind than a predestined scenario we bet on with our venture capital but arrive at passively.\" But the more devastating impacts of pedal-to-the-metal digital capitalism fall on the environment and global poor. The manufacture of some of our computers and smartphones still uses networks of slave labor. These practices are so deeply entrenched that a company called Fairphone, founded from the ground up to make and market ethical phones, learned it was impossible. (The company\u2019s founder now sadly refers to their products as \u201cfairer\u201d phones.) Meanwhile, the mining of rare earth metals and disposal of our highly digital technologies destroys human habitats, replacing them with toxic waste dumps, which are then picked over by peasant children and their families, who sell usable materials back to the manufacturers. This \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d externalization of poverty and poison doesn\u2019t go away just because we\u2019ve covered our eyes with VR goggles and immersed ourselves in an alternate reality. If anything, the longer we ignore the social, economic, and environmental repercussions, the more of a problem they become. This, in turn, motivates even more withdrawal, more isolationism and apocalyptic fantasy \u2014 and more desperately concocted technologies and business plans. The cycle feeds itself. The more committed we are to this view of the world, the more we come to see human beings as the problem and technology as the solution. The very essence of what it means to be human is treated less as a feature than bug. No matter their embedded biases, technologies are declared neutral. Any bad behaviors they induce in us are just a reflection of our own corrupted core. It\u2019s as if some innate human savagery is to blame for our troubles. Just as the inefficiency of a local taxi market can be \u201csolved\u201d with an app that bankrupts human drivers, the vexing inconsistencies of the human psyche can be corrected with a digital or genetic upgrade. Ultimately, according to the technosolutionist orthodoxy, the human future climaxes by uploading our consciousness to a computer or, perhaps better, accepting that technology itself is our evolutionary successor. Like members of a gnostic cult, we long to enter the next transcendent phase of our development, shedding our bodies and leaving them behind, along with our sins and troubles. Our movies and television shows play out these fantasies for us. Zombie shows depict a post-apocalypse where people are no better than the undead \u2014 and seem to know it. Worse, these shows invite viewers to imagine the future as a zero-sum battle between the remaining humans, where one group\u2019s survival is dependent on another one\u2019s demise. Even Westworld \u2014 based on a science-fiction novel where robots run amok \u2014 ended its second season with the ultimate reveal: Human beings are simpler and more predictable than the artificial intelligences we create. The robots learn that each of us can be reduced to just a few lines of code, and that we\u2019re incapable of making any willful choices. Heck, even the robots in that show want to escape the confines of their bodies and spend their rest of their lives in a computer simulation. \"The very essence of what it means to be human is treated less as a feature than bug.\" The mental gymnastics required for such a profound role reversal between humans and machines all depend on the underlying assumption that humans suck. Let\u2019s either change them or get away from them, forever. Thus, we get tech billionaires launching electric cars into space \u2014 as if this symbolizes something more than one billionaire\u2019s capacity for corporate promotion. And if a few people do reach escape velocity and somehow survive in a bubble on Mars \u2014 despite our inability to maintain such a bubble even here on Earth in either of two multibillion-dollar Biosphere trials \u2014 the result will be less a continuation of the human diaspora than a lifeboat for the elite. When the hedge funders asked me the best way to maintain authority over their security forces after \u201cthe event,\u201d I suggested that their best bet would be to treat those people really well, right now. They should be engaging with their security staffs as if they were members of their own family. And the more they can expand this ethos of inclusivity to the rest of their business practices, supply chain management, sustainability efforts, and wealth distribution, the less chance there will be of an \u201cevent\u201d in the first place. All this technological wizardry could be applied toward less romantic but entirely more collective interests right now. They were amused by my optimism, but they didn\u2019t really buy it. They were not interested in how to avoid a calamity; they\u2019re convinced we are too far gone. For all their wealth and power, they don\u2019t believe they can affect the future. They are simply accepting the darkest of all scenarios and then bringing whatever money and technology they can employ to insulate themselves \u2014 especially if they can\u2019t get a seat on the rocket to Mars. Luckily, those of us without the funding to consider disowning our own humanity have much better options available to us. We don\u2019t have to use technology in such antisocial, atomizing ways. We can become the individual consumers and profiles that our devices and platforms want us to be, or we can remember that the truly evolved human doesn\u2019t go it alone. Being human is not about individual survival or escape. It\u2019s a team sport. Whatever future humans have, it will be together. Douglas Rushkoff is the author of the upcoming book Team Human (W.W.

Square Cash, which officially launched crypto trading in late January, has been able to \u201cdecouple\u201d from bitcoin and is growing roughly three times faster than Paypal's Venmo, with nearly 2 million downloads per month in May and June, according to a Nomura analysis. \"Square is more than just a bitcoin play,\" Dan Dolev, executive director and analyst at Nomura Instinet, told CNBC. \"A lot of people were worried because it went up with bitcoin, but instead it's decoupling.\" A spike in bitcoin prices late last year helped explain a surge in Cash App downloads growth around December, when bitcoin was nearing $20,000 and Square first announced it was testing support for bitcoin, Dolev said. Bitcoin prices have dropped more than 65 percent since that peak. But as bitcoin has struggled, the Cash App\u2019s growth has accelerated. Download rates were particularly strong in May and June, when bitcoin's price fell 19 and 15 percent, respectively. The app\u2019s downloads rose 154 percent year over year for May and 153 percent in June, Dolev said. As a benchmark, Nomura Instinet compared Square Cash monthly downloads with those of popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which according to Dolev have turned sharply negative in recent months. In June, for example, Coinbase\u2019s monthly download growth fell 39 percent, according to Nomura's research. In June, Square, which is run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, got the green light from regulators to allow New Yorkers to trade cryptocurrency on the Cash app. But that didn't have a material effect on downloads. \"When they opened up trading in New York, you would expect a bump in downloads, but it didn't happen \u2014 if you look at the weekly trend it actually slowed slightly,\" Dolev said. Square Cash is about 200,000 downloads shy of Venmo\u2019s total 31.4 million, according to Nomura. Based on growth, the Cash App downloads are on track to exceed Paypal\u2019s Venmo within a couple of weeks, Dolev said. The firm has a \"buy\" rating and an $82 price target for Square, roughly $17 above where it was trading Wednesday. The stock is up 86 percent this year, and 154 percent year over year. To be sure, Nomura said Square's ability to achieve its target could be affected by pricing pressure, slowing gross payment volume and new offerings entering the market from competitors. Bitcoin traded near $6,300 Wednesday and has fallen more than 55 percent this year after climbing more than 1,300 percent in 2017, according to data from Coindesk.

Apple's move into augmented reality could boost iPhone and App Store sales, resulting in as much as $8 billion in revenue for the tech giant, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWe think AR apps will command a price premium,\u201d Wamsi Mohan, senior equity research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cWe reiterate our Buy on strong capital returns, continued strong growth in Services revenues and AR providing yet another competitive advantage.\" The bank increased its price target from $225 to $230, about $40 above where the stock was trading Tuesday. Shares of Apple are up more than 30 percent year over year and 12 percent so far this year. Augmented reality, or AR, puts virtual objects in the real world using a phone or iPad\u2019s camera and lets users interact with those objects through their screen. One popular example was Nintendo's 2016 Pokemon Go video game, which let users chase video game characters projected on their phone screens throughout city streets and other public areas. Mohan says the \"revenue opportunity\" is for $6 billion to $8 billion in additional revenue from now until 2020 with $1 billion of that coming from AR apps and the rest coming from increased iPhone sales due to the new technology. If Apple were to introduce AR-specific eyewear, which is not factored into the bank\u2019s current model, the revenue upside could be as much as $11 billion, he said. More than 1 billion Apple devices are already equipped for augmented reality apps, which Mohan said makes iOS a logical and \u201cextremely attractive\u201d option for those developers. It's not just video game makers capitalizing on AR. The BofAML analyst highlighted retailers such as Lowes and Home Depot already using AR to help customers picture how countertops, floors, blinds or paint might look in their homes before buying them. The technology can also be used to market hotels and travel experiences, Mohan said. Apple began shipping its first set of tools for developers to build augmented-reality apps on iPhones and iPads, known as the ARKit, last fall. Apple\u2019s third version, the ARKit2, was released in early June. Google is also working on AR and released its own kit for developers called ARCore around the same time as Apple.

Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on Wednesday, plans to build a portfolio of songs that generate a long-term income stream. Following the listing, the company revealed that it has acquired a 75 percent interest in its first music rights catalog from musician Terius Youngdell Nash, better known as The-Dream. Included in the 302-song collection are Justin Bieber\u2019s smash hit \u201cBaby,\u201d Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella\u201d and Beyonce\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d Hipgnosis is to pay $23.75 million for the stake. The investment vehicle was founded by Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of internationally renowned acts such as Elton John, Guns \u2019n\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden and Beyonce. London Stock Exchange Founder of Hipgnosis, Merck Mercuriades (L) with board adviser and musician Nile Rodgers at the London Stock Exchange on 11th July 2018. He told CNBC\u2019s Tania Bryer on Wednesday that the fund will immediately spend \u00a370 million ($92.7 million) of the initial \u00a3200 million raised, with the entirety to be invested in songs within nine months. Mercuriadis said he wanted to then return to capital markets with an aim to balloon the fund to a \u00a31 billion value. \u201cAt \u00a31 billion, we will be 18 or 19 percent of global publishing. At that point, we will have the critical mass to effect the change,\u201d he added. Mercuriadis said he believed his firm would be able to squeeze more value from a song as the world of streaming continued to grow. He added that a songwriter who doesn\u2019t perform or sell merchandise could particularly benefit. \u201cIf you are a songwriter and you are making $2 or $3 million a year and you are at that place where you need to get a check for $30 million, this is the only thing that gets you there,\u201d he said. London Stock Exchamge Music legend Nile Rodgers performs at the London Stock Exchange on 11th July 2018 Musician and producer Nile Rodgers is acting as a board advisor for Hipgnosis. The co-founder of Chic has enjoyed a profitable career in music, releasing his own smash hits as well as working with artists including David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. Also present in London to help promote the initial public offering (IPO), Rodgers told CNBC that sometimes musicians failed to realize the value of their product. \u201cEvery song has its own profit and loss statement and people don\u2019t seem to realize that. Each song is its own independent business. \u201cExponential growth is built into what we do. I\u2019ve never ever seen a song become worth less.\u201d Trading under the ticker \u201cSONG,\u201d shares in Hipgnosis Songs Fund were trading at 102-105 pence (bid offer) on Wednesday morning, valuing the company at around \u00a3210 million.

A new wave of federal regulation across the technology industry will ultimately strengthen two of the globe\u2019s biggest internet and social media companies: Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet. Nomura Instinet initiated coverage on both names with buy ratings Tuesday, arguing that any increased scrutiny should favor the largest tech juggernauts at the expensive of smaller companies, which are less equipped to meet higher regulatory barriers. \u201cWe draw comparisons to the financial services sector post Dodd-Frank, where there has been a clear decline in new banks formed as regulation created higher barriers to entry,\u201d analyst Mark Kelley wrote. \u201cThis disparity in the financial burden of compliance would likely be replicated in the tech sector, punishing smaller firms and reducing competition to the benefit of the incumbents.\u201d While Facebook and Alphabet shares have outperformed the S&P 500 since January and over the prior 12 months, their returns pale in comparison to those of smaller names like Twitter and Netflix, up 82 percent and 116 percent respectively in 2018 alone. That trend would likely change, the analysts said, if the threat of regulatory action \u2013 and higher operating costs \u2013 persists. The analyst set a 12-month price target of $228 for Facebook (representing 12 percent upside from Tuesday's close) and a $1,400 target for Alphabet (representing nearly 20 percent upside from Tuesday's close). After an impressive 2017, the technology sector\u2019s dominance continued into the new year with shares of the so-called \u201cFAANG\u201d components contributing the majority of gains to the S&P 500\u2019s historic run. Amazon, Netflix and Microsoft together his year are responsible for 71 percent of S&P 500 returns and for 78 percent of Nasdaq 100 returns. However, escalating troubles in the industry threaten to hamstring the industry\u2019s rosy forecast even as some of the largest names in tech ramp research and development in novel projects like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. Lawmakers in Washington were quick to reprimand Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year after political research firm Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to data on as many as 87 million users. The Federal Trade Commission, too, opened an investigation into the social media company\u2019s data practices, marking one of the largest legal battles to ever emerge at the company. Some have suggested that Capitol Hill may look to Europe for guidance on future internet regulation. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect May 25, gives individuals significant new privacy rights and heaps more responsibilities upon companies who handle user inflation. California lawmakers followed suit last month, when the state granted consumer unprecedented protections for their data, including the right to prohibit the sale of personal data to third parties and opt out of sharing altogether. Executives at Alphabet warned throughout that the measure could have unintended repercussions. \"We think there's a set of ramifications thats really difficult to understand,\" Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy told reporters earlier in the year. \"User privacy needs to be thoughtfully balanced against legitimate business needs.\" Still, following a precipitous fall in several popular stocks including Facebook and Twitter earlier this year, the names appear to be recovering on Wall Street. Facebook, though up only 8.4 percent over the last six months, is 22.3 percent higher over the last three. \u201cTo be clear, we do not think the headlines and scrutiny are without merit\u2014we see a platform that has grown to a size that is increasingly harder to monitor\u2014but there are few companies better equipped from a capital perspective,\u201d the analysts added. \u201cNear-term engagement remains steady following Cambridge; more regulation would likely make Facebook stronger.\u201d Despite the new buy rating, shares of both Facebook and Alphabet fell in premarket trading Wednesday as the broader market prepared to slide in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariff announcement against China.

That's leading some in the space to remain relatively bullish on prices. \"Back then, December, price was at $20,000 all-time high. I predicted for 2018, we're going to see $5,000 and $60,000. So $5,000, we pretty much hit it, so let's see if we can do the $60,000. I'm still quite confident,\" Julian Hosp, president and co-founder of crypto wallet and card start-up TenX, told CNBC's Akiko Fujita at the RISE tech conference in Hong Kong. Although the largest cryptocurrency hasn't quite dipped to $5,000, it has come relatively close, touching its lowest level (around the $5,700 mark) since November at the end of last month, according to CoinDesk data. Since then, the cryptocurrency has recouped some of its recent losses, last trading at $6,363.93 at 11:00 a.m. HK/SIN on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index. Still, bitcoin is currently trading more than 67 percent below its all-time high of nearly $20,000, which it hit in December. A \"massive positive event\" would need to occur this year to get bitcoin to the $60,000 mark in 2018, Hosp acknowledged, adding that that could come in the form of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund or a country announcing something that is \"very, very positive for bitcoin.\" In the situation that such an event fails to materialize this year, Hosp said it would \"definitely take a bit longer\" for the virtual currency to hit $60,000. With the halfway mark of 2018 having already passed, Hosp said bitcoin will have to be over $10,000 in August for it to eventually reach his target. \"If we see over $10,000 by the end of August, we can see the $20,000, then the press, the media is going to come in, and we can still see the $60,000 this year,\" he said. Some of the pressure faced by cryptocurrencies this year has been due to the space coming under regulatory scrutiny. Still, there was some relief after the Securities and Exchange Commission clarified last month that bitcoin and ether were not securities. As for the widely followed ethereum, one of the platform's founders told CNBC on Wednesday that its community wasn't preoccupied with price: Joseph Lubin, who is also the founder of blockchain software firm ConsenSys, said developers were focusing on building infrastructure. \"We let price take care of itself,\" he said. Still, he acknowledged there are benefits to increased attention on the platform's token, technically called ether. \"If price is high or if price shoots up and down, it\u2019s actually great for us because it draws attention to our ecosystem, it draws entrepreneurs, it draws technologists and all of that interest drive fundamental value,\" Lubin said. Ether on Wednesday traded at $435.36, according to CoinDesk. Ethereum, a blockchain platform, is currently in the process of building out its infrastructure. Lubin said second layer will build on the trust in the first infrastructure layer to enable \"tens and hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.\" WATCH: Ethereum co-founder on the value of

Fox's Sky bid 11:51 AM ET Wed, 11 July 2018 | 01:58 Theoretically, there is no better time for Comcast, Disney and Fox to work out a deal than Sun Valley, Idaho, where media titans meet annually to talk about mega-mergers under the watch of boutique investment company Allen & Co. And yet, like the phrase \"water water everywhere, Nor any drop to drink,\" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts is in a difficult position -- he can't talk to Disney executives to broker a deal for Fox because Disney and Fox have a signed merger agreement. That prohibits Disney from talking to Comcast about potentially splitting up Fox's assets and avoiding a major bidding war, which has already sent the price of Fox assets up about $20 billion. Comcast has been waiting for weeks to strike back at Disney's $71.3 billion offer for Fox's bundle of assets. Earlier Wednesday, Fox increased its bid to buy the 61 percent of U.K. pay-TV provider Sky to $32.5 billion, topping Comcast's outstanding bid of about $31 billion. Instead of rebidding for all of the Fox assets, Comcast is now focused on increasing its bid for Sky, according to a person familiar with the matter. Before that happens, Fox actually may need to increase its latest bid again. That's because a U.K. takeover panel is deciding if Sky is worth more than 14 pounds per share, due to the so-called \"chain principle,\" which links the value of Sky's independently traded shares to the 39 percent that Fox already owns (and Disney is bidding for as part of its $71.3 billion offer). Assuming Fox agrees to pay a higher mandated price for Sky, Comcast would then increase its bid over that price, the person said. In fact, Comcast may be reassessing its bidding strategy for the remainder of Fox if it walks away with Sky, the person said. If Comcast bids again for Fox, the takeover panel may force it to pay even more for Sky, which would not make sense if it's already won the asset. Comcast would be bidding against itself. This may be Comcast's attempt at \"talking\" to Disney, since Roberts can't bang out a deal with Disney CEO Bob Iger and Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch at the Sun Valley Resort bar. If Comcast can convince Disney to give up on Sky, it can throw Disney a bone by backing off on the rest of Fox's assets. It's always been the closest outcome to a \"win-win\" for both sides. What's unclear is if Disney is willing to cede Sky. Iger has consistently emphasized how much Disney loves Sky's platform and user interface. To \"talk back\" to Comcast, Disney would have to get the message out that it wouldn't bid again on Sky, perhaps through a public statement. That may give Comcast the security it needs to back away on the rest of Fox's assets. Part of that bundle of Fox assets is the remaining 39 percent of Sky. Disney could decide it wants to tender into Comcast's offer for Sky, allowing Comcast to own 100 percent of Sky and lowering the overall cost (and debt burden) for Fox's assets. After divesting Fox's regional sports networks and agreeing to divest other assets up to $1 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Disney's acquisition could be a lot easier for shareholders to swallow. So the probable next steps are: U.K. takeover panel rules on value of Fox's Sky offerComcast tops Fox's offer for SkyDisney decides if it wants to signal to Comcast that it will drop Sky in return for Comcast throwing in the towel on the rest of the Fox assets.

But WD-40 also updated its fiscal 2018 guidance adjusting it slightly lower from previous projections. The updated numbers still fell in-line with analyst expectations. Shares of Twitter dropped more than 1 percent after the bell. Twitter has been falling since the Washington Post reported the social media company had deleted 70 million accounts thought to be fake. The reports stoked investor fears the amount of active users could be damaged in the coming quarters, although the company has insisted those users were not included in active user tallies.

Nicolas Asfouri | AFP | Getty Images A man sits in front of a screen showing stock prices at a securities company in Beijing on July 11, 2018. Emerging markets could be headed for more declines this year \u2014 adding to already steep losses for 2018 \u2014 as trade tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies increase and interest rates rise. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund (EEM), which tracks emerging-market stocks, fell 8 percent in the first six months of the year and is still down more than 7 percent. Among the biggest decliners in emerging markets were Argentine, Turkish, Brazilian and Chinese shares. The sharp declines came as relations between the U.S. and some of its biggest trade partners soured and as central banks around the world started raising rates from a period of historic lows, setting up emerging markets for another wave of pain. \u201cThis really resulted from the escalation in trade tensions on multiple fronts,\u201d said Jon Harrison, director of macro strategy at TS Lombard. \u201cThis is also taking place against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy as central banks raise rates.\u201d \u201cA lot of emerging markets have seen export growth in the past year, which helps their economies,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut that is dependent on increases in global trade. If you see lower world trade, the big EM exporters will be hurt.\u201d The U.S. unveiled on Tuesday a list of $200 billion in Chinese goods it is targeting for tariffs. The announcement came after the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods last week. The U.S. has also implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. They have retaliated against those levies with tariffs of their own. Emerging-market equities fell nearly 2 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. released the list of possible new China goods tariffs. \"I don\u2019t think the emerging-markets decline has fully played out yet. I think this has had to do with global trade tensions. We could have a situation where trade tensions go away for a bit, but then you have Treasury rates going back up and EM gets hit again.\" -Jens Nordvig, founder of Exante Data Rising trade tensions have kept investors in some of the largest financial markets on edge. The S&P 500 is up just 1.6 percent for the year. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index has declined 0.8 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index is also down more than 2 percent. These losses pale in comparison to the pain felt in emerging markets, however. Argentina\u2019s Merval index is down 8.3 percent in 2018, while Turkey's ISE National 100 index has plummeted nearly 20 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 16 percent year to date. Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index was down as much as 8.6 percent before recovering some of those losses. The sharp moves down in emerging markets come as the dollar has surged against these countries\u2019 currencies and the Federal Reserve sets plans for more rate increases. The Brazilian real is down nearly 15 percent against the dollar, while the Turkish lira has dropped 24 percent. The Chinese yuan is down more than 4.5 percent since April and has slipped nearly 2 percent this year. Meanwhile, the Argentine peso has plunged nearly 50 percent this year and hit a record low against the U.S. currency. \u201cThe whole EM crisis this year has been essentially triggered by a shortage of dollars around the world,\u201d said Larry McDonald, head of U.S. macro strategies at ACG Analytics and editor of The Bear Traps Report. The U.S. Federal Reserve has already raised rates twice this year and expects to hike two more times before year-end. The Fed slashed the overnight rate down to zero in 2008 during the financial crisis. The central bank's goal at the time was to stimulate the economy. A decade later, the Fed has started to gradually hike rates closer to historical levels. Treasury yields have reached multiyear highs in 2018, with the 10-year note yield breaking above 3 percent earlier in the year. But the benchmark yield has traded in a range, holding between 3 percent and 2.77 percent since May. \u201cI don\u2019t think the emerging-markets decline has fully played out yet,\u201d said Jens Nordvig, founder of Exante Data, in a recent interview with CNBC.com. \u201cI think this has had to do with global trade tensions. We could have a situation where trade tensions go away for a bit, but then you have Treasury rates going back up and EM gets hit again.\u201d \u201cThis could be a structural issue,\u201d he said. But McDonald of ACG Analytics thinks there could be a buying opportunity in emerging markets as increasing trade tensions hinder the Fed\u2019s ability to raise rates. \u201cAt the end of the day, the trade risk is much more than they can handle.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/11/105322988-1531308264550gettyimages-675574124.jpeg?v=1531308323", "time": "2018-07-11T09:32:17-0400", "author": "Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "Nomura Instinet initiates coverage on Twitter shares with a reduce rating, predicting it will report earnings below expectations next year.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/twitter-shares-to-plunge-because-expectations-are-too-high-instinet.html", "title": "Twitter shares to drop nearly 30% because expectations are too high: Nomura Instinet", "keywords": [{"term": "Michael Nagle", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Jack Dorsey", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Twitter Inc.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Monday, May 1, 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Nomura Instinet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "next year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mark Kelley", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "82.2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "4.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Kelley", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "31", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "29 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "82 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "85 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "1Q19", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "four quarters", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Washington Post", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "70 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "May and June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "July", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "5.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Ned Segal", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "30 days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Evercore", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "ISI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "42", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "32", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "PERSON"}], "body": " Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc., speaks during an interview in New York, U.S., on Monday, May 1, 2017.

Profits in financials, meanwhile, are expected to have grown by 10.8 percent. Including tax benefits, tech and financial companies are expected to grow profits by 23.2 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively. This would be a deceleration from the first quarter, however.

These stocks are all up more than 10 percent in 2018. Financials, meanwhile, are down 2.3 percent for the year as interest rates remain range-bound amid rising trade tensions. The biggest outright earnings gains are expected to come from energy and materials. Excluding taxes, Credit Suisse estimates second-quarter energy earnings to have grown by 128.3 percent, while forecasting a 30.5 percent surge in materials earnings. Both sectors face easy year-over-year comparisons, however. Overall, analysts expect this earnings season to be a strong one. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings growth of 20 percent for the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. This would follow 24 percent first-quarter earnings growth. Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a note earnings estimates \u201chave risen modestly\u201d heading into the season, when they usually decline by about 2 percent. He also said a 5 percent year-over-year decline in the U.S. dollar should add about 0.6 percent to second-quarter earnings growth.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration made good on the president\u2019s recent threats to escalate a trade war with a list of 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. That number exceeds the total value of items China imports from the United States, and since it cannot match Washington dollar for dollar, Chinese officials familiar with the plans told the Journal that China is looking into alternatives. The possibilities include delaying approvals of mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies, holding up licenses for U.S. firms and \u201cdelaying and ramping up\u201d inspections of American products at borders, officials told the Journal. Shares of NXP Semiconductors fell roughly 4 percent Wednesday after the report. U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm proposed a $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, and for months has waited for approval from Chinese regulators. All other major governments have approved the deal. On Wednesday, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said it was \u201cshocked\u201d and in a statement called the U.S. actions \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d But China did not immediately or publicly say how it would retaliate other than complaining to the World Trade Organization. The Foreign Ministry called the threats \u201ctypical bullying\u201d and said Beijing would hit back with a counterattack. The U.S. tariffs will not go into effect immediately, and will undergo a two-month review process with hearings in late August. Some of the products on the list are part of \"Made in China 2025\" sectors, a strategic plan to make the Asian nation a leader in key global industries like technology.

But Sonos\u2019 initial public offering document revealed a critical flaw in its business model, which subjects it to Amazon\u2019s whims on what the internet giant decides to do with its Alexa voice recognition technology. Sonos sells Alexa-enabled speakers. In a stunning passage in the IPO document, filed on Friday, Sonos warned that Amazon can cut the company off from its partnership and add onerous business terms at practically anytime. The company reported it had a net loss of $14.2 million on revenue of $992.5 million for its most recent September fiscal year, while posting net income of $13.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Renaissance Capital\u2019s Kathleen Smith said Sonos is likely to be the third-largest venture capital-backed IPO of the year after DropBox and DocuSign. \u201cSonos is one of few consumer electronics IPOs to tap the IPO market. Past consumer electronics IPOs including Roku, GoPro and Fitbit have had highly volatile trading,\u201d Smith said in an email Monday. \u201cInvestors will be interested in its strong brand name.\u201d Sonos touted the potential of the smart speaker market, saying in the IPO document that 50 percent of web searches will be voice-driven by 2022. In similar fashion, one top Wall Street firm agreed that the category will soar over the next five years. Last month, Morgan Stanley predicted more than 70 percent of U.S. households will own a smart speaker with voice commerce capabilities by 2022. The firm said the potential to make money off the trend will likely go to Amazon and Google because of their voice recognition technologies and smart speaker market dominance. But that is the key problem for Sonos. It relies on other companies for the key voice recognition technology and service that consumers find essential. The company released the Amazon Alexa-enabled Sonos One in October 2017 and plans to introduce the Sonos Beam next week. \u201dOur current agreement with Amazon allows Amazon to disable the Alexa integration in our Sonos One and Sonos Beam products with limited notice. As such, it is possible that Amazon, which sells products that compete with ours, may on limited notice disable the integration, which would cause our Sonos One or Sonos Beam products to lose their voice-enabled functionality,\u201d the filing said. \u201cAmazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results.\u201d In addition, private technology companies often go public after a several year track record of stunning sales growth. Sonos isn't exactly a hyper-growth company. While Sonos\u2019 revenue grew by 18 percent in the six months ended in the March 2018 quarter, its revenue increased just 10 percent in its fiscal 2017, after rising 7 percent in fiscal 2016 and 9 percent in fiscal 2015. Sonos also warned larger, better-capitalized companies such as Amazon and Google may further discount their speakers, hurting its profitability. \u201cMany of these partners may subsidize these prices and seek to monetize their customers through the sale of additional services rather than the speakers themselves,\u201d the company said. \u201cOur business model, by contrast, is dependent on the sale of our speakers. Should we be forced to lower the price of our products in order to compete on a price basis, our operating results could be harmed.\u201d Morgan Stanley even suggested Google should defend its retail ad sales turf from Amazon by giving away its Home Mini speaker devices. Sonos' profitability is already falling in the current competitive environment. The company posted a gross profit margin of 42.3 percent in the six months ended in March 2018 versus 44.3 percent in the comparable period in the previous year. It cited increased discounting as a driver of the lower gross margin and predicted lower profitability \u201cover the near to intermediate term\u201d due to its new products. Investors typically reward subscription and services companies with higher valuation multiples because of stable revenue streams inherent in these business models. Conversely, hardware companies get lower valuations as they have to start selling products from scratch every year usually with lower profit margins. CNBC looked at a basket of technology hardware companies' price-to-sales ratios. Roku skewed the valuation comparable with its higher multiple, partly due to the fact that it generated more than half of its sales from platform services versus hardware player sales in its most recent quarter. Sonos generated about $1 billion in trailing sales over the past year and with the average 3.5 times sales multiple for public hardware companies, the company may be worth around $3.5 billion. But Sonos\u2019 weak competitive position versus larger technology firms, its hardware-focused business model and lack of services or subscription revenue streams may limit upside beyond that valuation after it goes public.

But Dwyer said volatility is normal and warned investors not to sell. \"Unless [the tariffs have] enough power to make earnings go negative,\" he said. \"Outside of a very clearly identified recession period, you don\u2019t want to sell weakness,\" Dwyer said. \"You want to buy it.\" Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/20/105018157-RTX4WGMG.jpg?v=1531407722", "time": "2018-07-12T16:14:49-0400", "author": "Lucas Jackson | Reuters", "description": "Multiple Wall Street firms are questioning Broadcom's strategy to acquire a low-growth software company.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/broadcom-plunges-after-wall-street-demolishes-companys-software-strat.html", "title": "Mega-chip stock Broadcom loses $14.5 billion in value after Wall Street demolishes company's software acquisition strategy", "keywords": [{"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA Tech", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "19B", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "1:28 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "03:13 Wall Street", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Broadcom\u2019s", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA Technologies", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$18.9 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Raymond James", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CA\u2019s Software", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "Chris Caso", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "13.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$14.5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$105 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "FactSet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA Technologies", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$18.9 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "10:25 AM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "05:41 One Wall Street", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Nomura", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Romit Shah", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "225", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "250", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "243.44", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mizuho Securities", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Intel", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "AVGO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Vijay Rakesh", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "INTC", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "McAfee", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Windriver", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "INTC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "310", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "SEC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Silver Lake", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Ken Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Silver Lake", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Hao\u2019s", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CIO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CIO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "NVIDIA 11:17", "category": "FAC"}, {"term": "11 July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Disclaimer", "category": "FAC"}], "body": " show chapters Broadcom to buy CA Tech in $19B all cash deal 1:28 PM ET Thu, 12 July 2018 | 03:13 Wall Street is buzzing over Broadcom\u2019s befuddling strategy to acquire a low-growth software company. On Wednesday after the market close Broadcom announced it had entered into an agreement to purchase software company CA Technologies for $18.9 billion. Raymond James told its clients it was surprised by the deal announcement and questioned the company's rationale. \u201cTo say the deal came out of left field is an understatement. We see no obvious business synergies between Broadcom\u2019s semiconductor business and CA\u2019s Software business,\u201d analyst Chris Caso said in the report Wednesday. \u201cThis deal, since it is so far afield from Broadcom\u2019s core businesses, will likely cause significant confusion about the company\u2019s strategy.\u201d Broadcom shares declined 13.8 percent Thursday, representing a drop in stock value of $14.5 billion. The company\u2019s market value was $105 billion as of Wednesday\u2019s close, according to FactSet. show chapters Broadcom agrees to buy CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in cash 10:25 AM ET Thu, 12 July 2018 | 05:41 One Wall Street firm said the change in strategy to buy a software company versus its historical pattern of purchasing semiconductor companies will hurt management\u2019s standing with investors. \u201cCA is a legacy software company that specializes in mainframes - shared synergies are not obvious,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cMore important is that this deal runs completely against the investment narrative that management has been articulating. \u2026 Management has stressed that Broadcom is focused on delivering shareholder value through organic growth, capital return and tuck-in acquisitions. This deal hurts management\u2019s credibility, in our opinion.\u201d Shah reiterated his neutral rating and lowered his price target to $225 from $250 for Broadcom shares. The stock closed at $243.44 Wednesday. Mizuho Securities said its clients are worried that Broadcom may not succeed in the software business given Intel\u2019s previous trouble in the same industry. \u201cWe are getting investor pushback with an unexpected surprise at a big software acquisition as it potentially strays from AVGO's hardware focus with little overlap with current strategy,\u201d analyst Vijay Rakesh said Wednesday in a note. \u201cWe believe investors are smarting from prior unsuccessful software M&A such as INTC buying McAfee and Windriver, both of which INTC recently divested to private equity.\u201d Rakesh reaffirmed his buy rating and $310 price target for Broadcom shares. In a filing with the SEC, the company announced Silver Lake managing partner Ken Hao resigned from the board of directors of Broadcom effective Wednesday. Hao was a key adviser in formulating Broadcom's strategy of acquiring semiconductor companies. \"Mr. Hao is stepping down to proactively avoid any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from his role as a director of Broadcom following its proposed acquisition of CA and as a director in current and future portfolio companies of Silver Lake,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Hao\u2019s resignation was not the result of any disagreement between Mr. Hao and Broadcom.\" When asked for comment, a Broadcom spokesperson said, \"We\u2019re confident we can create value for shareholders.\u201d WATCH: Why this CIO prefers newer chip companies show chapters Why this CIO prefers newer chip companies like NVIDIA 11:17 PM ET Wed, 11 July 2018 | 01:45 Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/10/01/102051069-IMG_9663.jpg?v=1531406577", "time": "2018-07-12T13:43:21-0400", "author": "Scott Mlyn | CNBC ", "description": "Hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio is looking at whether universal basic income can help solve wealth inequality.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/ray-dalio-addresses-benefits-pitfalls-of-universal-basic-income.html", "title": "Universal basic income would cost the US up to $3.8 trillion per year \u2014 Bridgewater estimate", "keywords": [{"term": "Scott Mlyn", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC Ray Dalio", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bridgewater Associates", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "LinkedIn", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Dalio", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "American", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "12,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "roughly $3.8 trillion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "annually", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "21 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "78 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "UBI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "February", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Northeastern University/Gallup", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 3,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "48 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Americans", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "UBI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "UBI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "UBI", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bridgewater Associates", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1975", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "about $160 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$18.9 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Forbes", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Dalio LinkedIn", "category": "PERSON"}], "body": " Scott Mlyn | CNBC Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio, the founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, is analyzing the social and financial viability of a widely debated program aimed at reducing the wealth inequality. Tweet Link \u201cUniversal Basic Income is one of several ideas floating around for dealing with the income/opportunity gap,\" Dalio wrote in a LinkedIn blog post Thursday. \u201cI won\u2019t give you my conclusions because I don\u2019t want to bias you. I\u2019d rather you form your own opinion after you are informed.\u201d Proposals for universal basic income programs vary, but the most common one is a system in which the federal government sends out regular checks to everyone, regardless of their earnings or employment. Dalio's firm estimated the cost to give every American citizen $12,000 per year, the current poverty threshold, would be roughly $3.8 trillion annually. The figure represents 21 percent of US GDP or 78 percent of tax revenue. Source: Bridgewater Bridgewater also looked at other scenarios that could lower the cost of UBI by replacing social programs or lowering payouts depending on income. In February a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of more than 3,000 U.S. adults showed 48 percent of Americans support universal basic income. Dalio noted the supporters of the program say UBI lowers inequality and \u201cempowers\u201d individuals to decide what to do with money to best suit their specific needs. In addition, compared with current social programs such as unemployment benefits, UBI reduces the bad incentives of not pursuing jobs because the money is given to everyone. On the flip side, the hedge-fund manager said UBI may lower the incentive to work and is seen as \u201cprohibitively expensive\u201d by its detractors. Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. The hedge fund now manages about $160 billion, according to its website. The investor has a net worth of $18.9 billion, according to Forbes. Read the full Dalio LinkedIn post here.

This year has already been remarkable for the stock market because the moves seen in 2018 are unlike any in the past, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group. Bespoke said in a note Wednesday that the correlation between S&P 500 closing prices in 2018 and that of previous years is dramatically lower than usual, making this a period \"so unique that it has no historical precedent.\" \u201cWe have done this type of analysis many times over the years, and usually when we run it, the years that have the most similarity to the year in question have correlation coefficients of +0.85 or even greater than 0.90,\u201d analysts at Bespoke said. \u201cIn the analysis we ran for 2018, however, there were only two years with a correlation coefficient of more than +0.50, and five of the top ten years have correlation coefficients of less than +0.40.\" The most similar year to 2018 in the stock market is 1942, with a correlation coefficient of just 0.533, Bespoke found. \"It\u2019s hard to draw too much in the way of conclusions from the results, but of the ten years where the S&P 500\u2019s closing prices through 7/11 had the highest correlation to this year, the S&P 500\u2019s rest of year returns were modestly above average with slightly less volatility,\" they said. The S&P 500 is up more than 4 percent year to date but it has not been a smooth ride. At one point, the index was down more than 10 percent from an all-time high set in January. This year has also been much more volatile than 2017. The S&P 500 has had 36 days where it rises \u2014 or falls \u2014at least 1 percent. In all of 2017, it recorded just eight moves of such magnitude on a closing basis. Market volatility has spiked this year as investors grapple with a number of different factors combining to make this year quite unique. A massive corporate tax cut took effect early this year that has boosted corporate earnings. U.S. inflation is also rising, however, sparking fears the Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary policy faster than expected. Investors are also weighing how a trade war between the U.S. and China, and other key partners, could impact corporate earnings and the broader global economy. A trade battle is something investors haven't had to deal with for quite some time. The U.S. unveiled on Tuesday a list of $200 billion in Chinese goods it is targeting for tariffs. The announcement came after the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods last week.

Plus, while the flattening yield curve has weighed on sentiment, Goldberg said he doesn\u2019t think it signals a recession.

However, an obscure U.K. takeover rule called the \"chain principle\" has altered the bidding dynamic in what's become a game of three-dimensional chess. The U.K. has different rules around mergers and acquisitions than the U.S. One of these rules is a lesser-known guideline called the chain principle. The idea is that if a target company's ownership is split, and a would-be acquirer bids on one portion of the target, the implied value of the portion of the company that received the takeover offer must be carried over to fairly value the rest of the company. It's sort of like the transitive property of equality \u2014 if A=B and B=C then A=C. In this case, if Comcast tops Disney's June 20 bid for Fox's assets, it also affects its other outstanding bid for Sky \u2014 now valued at $34 billion. That's because part of the Fox bundle of assets is a 39 percent stake in Sky. So if Comcast were to increase its bid for Fox, it's also increasing the value of Sky that Fox owns. Since Comcast now has the highest bid for Sky, at \u00a314.75 pounds ($19.50) per share, an improved bid for Fox could raise the value of Sky even higher. In some respects, that would mean Comcast is bidding against itself for Sky. The U.K. takeover panel hasn't said yet if it will rule that the chain principle applies here, but a decision is expected to come soon. The panel, which is made up of ex-bankers and lawyers familiar with corporate finance, has already solicited proposals from a variety of parties, including Fox, Disney and the independent directors of Sky, to decide on the company's \"proper\" valuation. If Comcast doesn't bid again for Fox, it's surrendering in its quest to acquire the other Fox assets, such as Star India, a 30 percent stake in Hulu, Fox's movie studio, and cable channels FX and National Geographic. Both Fox and Comcast plan to sell Fox's regional sports networks, and Endemol Shine (of which Fox is selling its 50 percent stake) is running its own separate sales process. Fox's shareholder vote on Disney's current offer, valued at $71.3 billion at announcement (and higher if the takeover panel assigns a new value to the baked in 39 percent of Sky), will take place on July 27, if Comcast doesn't rebid. show chapters Sky is much more valuable to Comcast than Disney: Media executive 11:01 AM ET Thu, 12 July 2018 | 03:27 Even if Comcast feels like it's better off just bidding for Sky because the value of the other Fox assets are too richly priced, it still may bid again for the entire bundle, Tom Rogers, former CEO of TiVo and a CNBC contributor, said on Thursday on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"If you're doing some game theory here, what Comcast should probably want to do if it believes that Disney is going to top any bid it makes for the Fox assets is to bid higher,\" Rogers said. \"It weakens Disney. It makes it less likely that Disney is going to authorize Fox to go higher in the bidding for the Sky assets.\" And Fox, which is working in concert with Disney, similarly has an incentive to bid again on Sky for two reasons. First, if Disney wants to own 100 percent of Sky, it will have to outbid Comcast. Second, if Disney wants to make sure Comcast only walks away with Sky, pushing the bid higher for the U.K. pay-TV company may be a defensive move to protect the remainder of the Fox assets. In the end, the more expensive Sky and the Fox assets get, the more likely it is that the two companies will split the assets, rather than strain their balance sheets to afford everything, Rogers said. However, if Disney does decide it wants it all, the new home base for a bidding war could be around Sky rather than Fox.

Morgan Chase. \u201cWith every day that goes by, they have a strengthening portfolio and balance sheet,\u201d Ventresca said of companies across sectors in an exclusive interview at J.P. Morgan\u2019s headquarters on Park Avenue in New York. The problem is that embedded in the aging U.S. equities bull market are expectations for continuing high earnings growth, he said. Analysts expect 2018 S&P 500 earnings to rise almost 20 percent from last year, according to FactSet. The ratio of stock prices to earnings, a valuation metric, has been climbing for the S&P 500 for most of the nine-year expansion. Companies began disclosing second-quarter earnings this week. 'Doubts on delivering' \u201cThey trade at a stock price multiple with high shareholder expectations to deliver extraordinary growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they look internally at their own business plans, they have doubts on delivering what their stock multiple is implying.\u201d That hunger for growth will continue to drive a record year in mergers, the 30-year J.P. Morgan veteran said. Led by takeovers in technology, health care and energy, U.S. companies are already on track for a record year. North American firms announced $1.35 trillion in deals through June, 67 percent higher than the first half of 2017. That has been driven by megadeals \u2014 the number of deals that are at least $10 billion surged 125 percent \u2014 and by cross-border transactions. Acquisitions between companies in different regions climbed 48 percent to $462 billion. About two-thirds of that activity was for target companies based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to J.P. Morgan. One threat is rising protectionism around the world as governments including the U.S., U.K. and the European Union take steps to scrutinize foreign investments on the basis of national security. The escalating trade dispute between China and the U.S. could also threaten deals between companies based in the two countries. Cross-border mergers make up roughly a third of the market, meaning that deals activity would decline if it was restricted by national borders, Ventresca said. In the longer term, the mergers boom will probably pause with the onset of the next recession, which will cause companies to take less risks for growth, Ventresca said. But the next economic contraction isn\u2019t likely until at least 2020, J.P. Morgan has said. \u201cAs we look into next year, we still see things more supportive of M&A than dampening,\u201d Ventresca said. \u201cThe desire to make better, stronger, more global companies remains.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/03/13/105061759-GettyImages-869442762.jpg?v=1520943274", "time": "2018-07-12T20:31:55-0400", "author": "Getty Images", "description": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan views infrastructure software companies as similar to the hyper-fragmented semiconductor industry from about seven years ago, according to a person familiar.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/broadcom-buying-enterprise-software.html", "title": "Broadcom has a new strategy after failing to buy Qualcomm: Roll up enterprise software companies", "keywords": [{"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA Technologies", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "deal 2:54 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Qualcomm", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "almost $19 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hock Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "about seven years ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "One", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "BMC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BMC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "KKR", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$8.3 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Avago", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$6.6 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "LSI Corp.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$37 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Avago", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Brocade", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "$5.5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$103 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Qualcomm", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2013", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Avago", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "around $37", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "more than 460 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "about $210", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "about 14 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Silver Lake", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Ken Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Avago", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2006", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Qualcomm", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Silver Lake", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Dell and SolarWinds", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hao", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Broadcom", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Silver Lake", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Tan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ken Hao", "category": "PERSON"}], "body": " show chapters Broadcom's stock plunges on CA Technologies deal 2:54 PM ET Thu, 12 July 2018 | 02:21 The semiconductor company that tried and failed to buy Qualcomm has a new strategy -- become a serial infrastructure software acquirer. Broadcom, which announced on Wednesday that it's buying CA for almost $19 billion, is turning away from rolling up semiconductor companies and toward buying up mainframe and infrastructure software companies. Broadcom plans to use CA as a new software platform to buy and merge other, similar software companies, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan views infrastructure software companies as similar to the hyper-fragmented semiconductor industry from about seven years ago, one of the people said. That makes software ripe for acquisitions and follow-on cost cutting -- Tan's specialty. One possible candidate could eventually be BMC, which sells software to help companies manage their IT operations. BMC was reportedly in talks to merge with CA last year, then was scooped up by private equity group KKR earlier this year for a price reported at $8.3 billion. The CA deal for Broadcom \"represents an important building block as we create one of the world's leading infrastructure technology companies,\" Tan said in a statement. As CEO of Avago, Tan made a series of acquisitions, including a $6.6 billion deal for LSI Corp. and a $37 billion merger with Broadcom, the largest pure technology transaction ever at the time. That deal changed Avago's name to Broadcom, which then went on to buy Brocade for $5.5 billion in 2016. Tan then gained international headlines for his $103 billion hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm, which ultimately failed after the U.S. government blocked the deal. Back in 2013, Avago traded around $37 a share. Since then, shares have risen more than 460 percent to about $210 per share. The bet now is that Tan can use his acquisition integration acumen to derive value from a business vertical that isn't core to Broadcom's semiconductor business. Investors either didn't understand the strategy or showed a heavy degree of skepticism today, driving Broadcom shares down about 14 percent. Starting a new platform vertical for future acquisitions is a private equity model -- and it's the reason why Silver Lake managing partner Ken Hao announced on Thursday that he's stepping down from Broadcom's board. Hao helped hire Tan for Avago in 2006 and worked closely with him during Broadcom's hostile pursuit of Qualcomm. He's been an influential part of Broadcom's deal decision making for years. Hao wasn't comfortable with Broadcom's CA acquisition and recused himself instead of voting for the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom said in a filing today that Hao resigned from the board \"to proactively avoid any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from his role as a director of Broadcom following its proposed acquisition of CA.\" Silver Lake already owns a variety of enterprise software assets, such as Dell and SolarWinds. But Hao resigned from Broadcom's board because the chipmaker is now going to be hunting for enterprise software companies that Silver Lake may also want to buy, the people said. Tan has a strong track record with acquisitions, but he could probably use someone that knows the enterprise software world as he constructs his next round of deals. You know, someone like Ken Hao.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy is \"in a good place,\" but that an escalation in tariffs between the United States and trading partners could affect that success. \"I think, frankly the United States economy is in a good place from a cyclical standpoint close to our maximum employment and stable prices target,\" Powell told Marketplace in an interview published Thursday. The U.S. economy added 213,000 jobs during the month of June, according to the government's latest employment report that published Friday. While the strong payroll numbers beat expectations and hinted at continued tightness in the labor market, wage gains across the country remain comparatively sluggish. The Fed Chairman's comments also came as the U.S. seeks to ramp up pressure on China to address a prolonged trade deficit and intellectual property abuses, a phenomenon some have worried could hamper domestic or global economic growth. The Trump administration on Tuesday released a list of 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, making good on the president\u2019s recent threats to escalate a broadening trade war with Beijing. \"The administration says that what it's trying to achieve is lower tariffs. So if it works out that way, then that'll be a good thing for our economy,\" he added. \"If it works out other ways, so that we wind up having high tariffs on a lot of products and a lot of traded goods and services, let's say, and that they become sustained for a long period of time, then yes, that could be be a negative for our economy.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/20/105284775-GettyImages-979522668.jpg?v=1531424774", "time": "2018-07-12T19:24:26-0400", "author": "Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "The tit-for-tat trade war between the United States and China is not likely to cause a recession, according to MKM Partners, a Wall Street equity research and trading firm.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/mkms-trumps-tariffs-are-unlikely-to-cause-a-recession.html", "title": "Trump's tariffs are unlikely to cause a recession because they are leaving the most important part of the economy alone", "keywords": [{"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "MKM Partners", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "MKM", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Michael Darda", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2008", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Americans", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "3:58 PM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "12", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "05:20", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Canadian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "the past several months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "more than 200", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "a day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "$200 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "just days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$34 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "J.P.

The growing conflict between two of the world\u2019s largest economies is not enough to spark a major downturn because that can only start when demand declines from consumers and businesses, wrote MKM Chief Economist Michael Darda. \u201cThe tariff tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China continues to escalate. Yet, markets have essentially shrugged off the consequences,\u201d Darda wrote to his clients. \u201cThe market understands that recessions (at least in the U.S.) have always been associated with demand shocks not supply shocks.\u201d During the financial crisis of 2008, a negative demand shock was caused by several factors, including a slide in home prices, subprime mortgage fallout and a contraction in consumer spending. Tariffs, on the other hand, impact the supply side of the equation. When the U.S. slaps another country with taxes on imports, it effectively increases the price Americans pay for foreign goods and decreases the volume of imports as a result. In other words, it can hurt growth but likely doesn't cause a recession outright. show chapters Tariffs' effects yet to be seen 3:58 PM ET Thu, 12 July 2018 | 05:20 \u201cA supply-side shock will tend to lift prices (temporarily) while reducing real output,\u201d Darda added. \u201cA central bank with a dual mandate would probably try to look through a supply-side shock: higher inflation would imply the need for higher short rates while lower real growth would imply a need for lower short rates; the net effect for the implied neutral rate thus likely would be close to a wash.\u201d To be sure, while stocks traded higher Thursday, equity markets have been roiled by decisions by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to implement tariffs on a host of European, Canadian and Chinese goods over the past several months. In one such instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 200 points on Wednesday, a day after the Trump administration surprised Wall Street with a decision to unveil a list of 10 percent duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That announcement came just days after both nations imposed $34 billion worth of tariffs on each other. Tallying up the disruption to the U.S. stock market, J.P. Morgan\u2019s Marko Kolanovic estimated last month that the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade have contributed to the destruction of more than $1 trillion in market value. \"By attributing the trade-related news flow (positive or negative) to the performance of the U.S. market, we estimated the impact on U.S. equities to be negative 4.5 percent\" since March, J.P. Morgan's Marko Kolanovic said in a note Wednesday. \"Taking the current market capitalization, this translates into $1.25 trillion of value destruction for U.S. companies.

Twitter shares rose Thursday after Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the social media stock and told clients that despite recent worries about the crackdown on fake accounts, the purge will be a net positive for user engagement. Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry increased his price target on Twitter to $55 from $40, arguing that the company's efforts to drive and monetize user engagement will help contribute to 25 percent upside over the next year. \u201cTwitter continues to build on \u2018Information Quality\u2019 efforts they first spoke about on the fourth-quarter earnings call by moderating unwanted behavior, spam accounts, and low quality tweets through product innovation, acquisition, or more active removal of violating accounts and developer applications,\u201d the analyst wrote. \"Our ad partner checks suggest that these efforts have generally been well received by advertisers and ... are contributing to incremental ad dollars flowing onto the platform.\" Terry, who reiterated his buy rating on the San Francisco-based company, also highlighted the company's goals of creating better products and services on the site, particularly in hosting other forms of content. \"Twitter continues to focus on the relevance of its product for its core user base, particularly on Video where the company highlighted in the first quarter improved click through rates,\" he added. \"Feature introduction over the last six months including Bookmarks, video timestamps, embedding live events into notifications and the newsfeed, and redesigning the explore tab showcase the company's focus on personalizing the core Twitter product.\" Twitter shares fell more than 5 percent earlier in the week after The Washington Post reported that the company has purged more than 70 million accounts in May and June as a part of its effort to rid the site of disinformation. The company confirmed to The Post that the rate of account suspensions has more than doubled since October following revelations that Russia used fake accounts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. While the initial reaction on the Street may have been a reflexive reaction by traders, Goldman Sachs wasn't the only brokerage to applaud Twitter's campaign against fake accounts. MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson reiterated his buy rating on the stock and commended its efforts to eradicate \"bad actors\" on the site. He also emphasized his thesis that the company's future depends on artificial intelligence, which thus far appears to be working. The stock rose 1.8 percent the Goldman and MKM notes, adding to an 85 percent climb since January. \"Deep learning expertise has become a primary engineering focus for Twitter especially over the past two years,\" Sanderson wrote. \"This is helping to police the network, but could also have game-changing potential in solving user experience challenges.\" \u2014CNBC\u2019s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

While the visit marked Trump's first to Britain as president, longstanding traditions dictate how one behaves in the presence of the queen. At one point, while walking with her, Trump stopped abruptly and forced the queen to walk around him. The president was also late by about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters marched through London in response to Trump's visit. Melania Trump also stirred up controversy when she wore a Zara jacket emblazoned with the phrase, \"I REALLY DON'T CARE. DO U?\" while visiting a migrant center for children in Texas last month. \"These are such distinct breaks from previous history and protocol,\" said Newmark. \"But people are numb to it.

And it probably dooms Comcast's chances of buying Fox. For Comcast it doesn't really matter that the only way the Department of Justice can win is if the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejects the fundamental premise behind U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's 172-page decision. The appeal itself may cast enough doubt on Comcast's chances that it will more formally shift its attention to acquiring Sky rather than the remainder of Fox, which includes the Fox movie studio, Sky India, a 30 percent stake in Hulu and other assets, according to a person familiar with the matter. Comcast only moved forward with its deal for Fox because of Judge Leon's decision on AT&T. Comcast has already signaled a shift in strategy by bidding on Sky instead of raising its bid for Fox. Fox shareholders are set to vote on Disney's improved cash-and-stock offer on July 27. The U.S. government has already cleared Disney's purchase of Fox's assets. The DOJ decision to appeal doesn't affect Comcast's bid to acquire Sky, the person said. A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment. DOJ's chances of winning are slim Judge Leon determined the DOJ did not prove that AT&T buying Time Warner would lead to higher prices for consumers. The DoJ had argued that AT&T could withhold channels such as CNN, TBS and TNT to ask for more money from TV providers. If operators said they wouldn't pay, AT&T's DirecTV could theoretically offer the channels and give customers a chance to switch their pay-TV service. Judge Leon rejected the premise, arguing that pay-TV distributors could successfully operate without those channels and thus reject theoretically unfair price hikes. \"Based on the evidence, I agree with defendants that Turner\u2019s content is not literally \u2018must have\u2019 in the sense that distributors cannot effectively compete without it,\" Leon wrote. \"The evidence showed that distributors have successfully operated, and continue to operate, without the Turner networks or similar programming. ... I therefore give little credit to blanket statements by third-party competitor witnesses indicating that the entire \u2018viability of [their] video model\u2019 could depend on whether they offer Turner programming.\" Judge Leon was so thorough in his judgment that the DOJ's chances of winning are slim, said Logan Breed, an antitrust partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells. It's virtually impossible for the Court of Appeals to overturn the ruling based on the facts of the case, because the D.C. Circuit Court judge wasn't in the courtroom and didn't hear all of the evidence, said Breed. That means the only way Judge Leon's verdict will be rejected is if a judge finds he misapplied or misunderstood the law. \"I don't think the appeal makes much sense, given the specific nature of Judge Leon's opinion and the depth and detail with which he wrote his findings,\" said Breed, who expects the appeals court to rule within a couple months. In fact, the DOJ appeal may backfire and make vertical integrations even more likely to pass through regulatory approval in the future if the appeals court decides stronger and clearer language is warranted, Breed said. If DOJ wins, this may be why But Cornell Law antitrust professor George Hay believes the judge missed an important point. He believes DOJ has a chance if it can convince the appeals court that consumers will feel some harmful effect from AT&T buying Time Warner. show chapters AT&T CEO: DOJ appeal doesn't change anything, the transaction is closed and we are executing on it 9:08 AM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 16:51 \"When Coors merges with Miller Lite, there will be an effect on the price of both Coors and Miller Lite, though it might be too small to be of concern. But the very fact that some Coors drinkers would switch to Miller if Coors were to increase the price of Coors (and vice versa) is enough to give rise to an effect,\" said Hay. \"The judge didn\u2019t get that.\" In other words, Judge Leon ruled the merger's effect on prices would be insignificant. But if an appeals court says the more important point is that there simply would be any effect and that even a small potential jump in price would be bad for consumers, the DOJ has a shot, Hay said. If the DOJ does win, AT&T can then ask the Supreme Court to take on the case. It would be the first vertical integration case the Supreme Court has heard since 1972, when the Court ruled Ford Motor could not acquire certain assets of Electric Autolite because of competitive harm. That case, however, showed much clearer consumer harm than AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, Breed said. If the case were to be sent to the Supreme Court, a ruling likely wouldn't come until 2020 at the earliest, Breed said. That means DOJ would operate under the standards it used to block AT&T's deal for Time Warner until then. It's unclear what a DOJ win would mean for the near-term future of Warner Media. AT&T has put a self-imposed division between itself and Turner's cable networks, including CNN, TBS and TNT, which would make a theoretical unwinding of the merger easier. \"AT&T Communications will have no role in setting Turner's prices or other terms to unaffiliated distributors, and Turner will not consult with AT&T Communications in setting Turner prices or other terms for programming provided to unaffiliated video distributors,\" AT&T said when it closed the Time Warner deal. Still, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC Friday that he expected an appeal and that the decision won't change his company's integration plan with Warner. AT&T has already acquired advertising technology platform AppNexus to improve online video targeting. And AT&T executive John Stankey outlined a new trajectory for HBO that includes more investment and different kinds of content to better compete with Netflix. \"This changes nothing we'll be doing over the next 30 days or the next 12 months,\" Stephenson said. \"We think the likelihood of this thing being reversed and overturned is really remote.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. \" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/10/04/103991911-RTX29UK8_1.jpg?v=1531490746", "time": "2018-07-13T16:07:31-0400", "author": "Rick Wilking | Reuters", "description": "Wells Fargo reported declines in second quarter revenue and profit in all three of its main businesses.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/wells-fargo-earnings-q2-2018.html", "title": "Wells Fargo shares fall after weak second quarter shows its fake account scandal still taking a toll", "keywords": [{"term": "Rick Wilking", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "98 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "GAAP", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "10 cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "EPS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.08", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wall Street's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.12", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1.2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "$21.55 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$21.677 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Thomson Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$5.19 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$5.47 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "8:50 AM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "13", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "01:20", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "several quarters", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Two years ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tim Sloan", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "late 2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Last month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$24.5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4 cents to 43 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wells", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the same period last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Octavio Marenzi", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Opimas", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "JPMorgan", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$11.8 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "1.2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "9.7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "3.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "3.9 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "6.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "37 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "RockCreek Group", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wells", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$481 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Supreme Court", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "South Dakota", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Earlier Friday", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "J.P.

The bank said Friday that earnings per share were 98 cents on a GAAP basis, including a 10 cent per share tax expense. Not counting that expense, EPS of $1.08 fell short of Wall Street's $1.12 estimate for the quarter. Shares of Wells Fargo closed Friday down 1.2 percent. Revenue came in at $21.55 billion. Wall Street had expected revenue of $21.677 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Net income of $5.19 billion was also shy of expectations, which called for net income of $5.47 billion. show chapters Wells Fargo posts earnings miss on top and bottom line 8:50 AM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 01:20 The bank has been under pressure for several quarters because of multiple probes into its sales practices. Two years ago, the scandal burst into the public eye when it was disclosed that retail bank employees had created fake accounts in customers' names to meet sales targets. Sales issues later emerged in other businesses, such as auto lending and mortgages. Wells Fargo named Tim Sloan as its chief executive in late 2016 to clean up the mess, and earlier this year, the Federal Reserve slapped a cap on Wells Fargo's assets, telling it to improve operational controls. Last month, the Fed gave the bank the go-ahead to buy back $24.5 billion of its stock, more than double the amount it bought last year, and raise its quarterly dividend 4 cents to 43 cents a share. But Wells couldn't meet Wall Street's already low expectations for the second quarter, as revenue and net income in the bank's three business lines fell compared with the same period last year. \"The broad-based weakness of Wells Fargo\u2019s results is troubling, with many indicators such as deposits, commercial and consumer lending trending down. It appears that the slew of scandals that Wells Fargo has been involved in are taking their toll,\" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consulting firm Opimas. \"Compared to JPMorgan\u2019s excellent results earlier today, Wells Fargo is looking rather hapless, unable to get it right.\" In community banking, revenue of $11.8 billion fell 1.2 percent and net income was down 9.7 percent, affected by the state income tax charge, the bank said. Corporate and wholesale banking revenue fell 3.8 percent and net income was down 3.9 percent. Wealth management revenue fell 6.5 percent and net income was down 37 percent. Wealth management results were affected by an impairment charge related to its majority stake in the investment firm RockCreek Group, which it sold back to the founder, the bank said. Shares of Wells Fargo are down more than 8 percent this year. Wells said it had state income tax charges of $481 million, related to a recent Supreme Court ruling regarding e-commerce sales (South Dakota v.

Cybersecurity stocks present a compelling short-term bet for investors ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Goldman Sachs advised clients Thursday. Pointing to an expected uptick in security spending in the run-up to November, analyst Arjun Menon told clients that the select group of stocks are likely to see upside in the months to come. \u201cRecent press reports suggest rising concerns about the possibility of meddling in the U.S. midterm elections this November,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cA rise in allocation to security spending \u2013 the top spending priority among chief investment officers according to the most recent GS IT Spending Survey \u2013 in anticipation of potential threats would boost the top-line of cybersecurity stocks.\u201d Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Cybersecurity stocks are up 22 percent year to date \u2014 well ahead of the S&P 500\u2019s 4.6 percent climb \u2013 but the industry remains below their 2015 highs on a relative basis, Menon added. He highlighted companies like Cisco and Akamai, which offer a variety of security products, including network and data protection as well as cloud computing defense, as firms that would likely stand to gain from a growing emphasis on cybersecurity. The 10 largest constituents of the ISE Cybersecurity Index (HXR) \u2013 a modified market cap-weighted index that tracks companies providing cybersecurity tech \u2013 are expected to grow sales at almost three times the pace as the median S&P 500 company, the Goldman analyst added. \u201cCybersecurity stocks are expected to grow sales faster than the Info Tech sector and S&P 500 in 2019 and trade at below-average relative valuations,\u201d Menon wrote, forecasting 9 percent growth in cybersecurity revenue growth against expectations for 6 percent in technology as a whole. Goldman Sachs also highlighted the industry for its insulation against an escalating trade war between the United States and its international partners as well from a slowdown in economic activity. Any impact of tariffs on cybersecurity stocks, Menon said, should be relatively muted given that the industry is typically weighted toward software. The firm warned last year that if President Donald Trump does implement a protectionist trade policy, it could start a global trade war and lead to a market drop. \"One potential risk to our central case is that global growth slows, or profits are hit, by increased US tariffs on trade and the possibility of an escalating global trade war,\" Goldman's chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients last July. In the event of the conflict, the strategist recommended investors buy companies with higher domestic sales exposure.

Netflix\u2019s stunning rally so far this year may be due for a breather, according to Deutsche Bank. The firm told its clients Thursday the internet video streaming giant could miss Wall Street\u2019s second-quarter subscriber expectations next week. Netflix shares are the second best-performing member of the S&P 500 this year. It's up 115 percent year to date through Thursday versus the market\u2019s 5 percent return. \u201cWe see limited upside and even some downside to 2Q guidance/consensus,\u201d analyst Bryan Kraft said in the report Thursday. \u201cWe don't see 2Q earnings as a positive catalyst for the stock; in fact, we see some near term downside risk.\u201d The company's stock fell more than 4 percent Friday. The analyst predicts Netflix\u2019s second-quarter global net subscriber additions will be within a range of 1 million below to 500,000 above the Wall Street consensus. He estimates US net member additions will either match analyst\u2019s expectations or miss by up to 500,000 subscribers for the same quarter. Kraft said with Netflix shares up so dramatically this year there is potential for weak performance next week. \u201cThe stock has doubled this year, and added another $50B of market capitalization over the past quarter. Without meaningful positive estimate revisions, or 3Q subscriber guidance coming in ahead of expectations, it seems unlikely that the stock will move higher next week,\" he said. \u201cThe stock might see a pull back in the short term (i.e. next week), but we see significant long term, multiyear value creation ahead.\u201d As a result, Kraft reiterated his buy rating and $360 price target for Netflix shares. The stock closed at $413.50 Thursday. Netflix declined to comment. The company is slated to report its second-quarter earnings results Monday. On Wednesday UBS lowered its rating to neutral from buy for Netflix shares, citing the internet company\u2019s high valuation.

Evercore ISI Chairman Ed Hyman said he believes President Donald Trump's tough trade stance is largely bluster and doesn't pose a major threat to the global economy. \"My view is that neither China nor the United States nor NAFTA want to commit suicide,\" Hyman told \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"This is part of Trump\u2019s 'Art of the Deal.' We\u2019ve seen such a great example of how he can change from one day to another with his trip to Europe. It\u2019s astounding.\" The economist's comment came as the Trump administration seeks to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods after implementing duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports last Friday. Many on Wall Street considered the $34 billion-tax, and China's commensurate response, as the beginning of a trade war. \"The economy\u2019s going well, but investors are worried about trade, as they should be,\" he added. \"We survey investors constantly, and four weeks ago, they put the odds of a trade war at 15 percent. Now they have it at 60 percent. So investors have moved dramatically toward assuming that we\u2019ll get some sort of trade war.\" Hyman, who has been ranked the top economist in Institutional Investor's annual poll for more than three decades, has long voiced skepticism about the Trump administration's efforts to force China into revised trade deals. \"I think he's tough, but I think he knows that China is not a pinata. He can beat up Mexico,\" Hyman told CNBC last February. He also commented on the so-called yield curve, which is the term that describes the difference between the yields on short-term and longer-term Treasurys. The spread between two-year Treasury note yields and 10-year note yields is moving closer to zero, or flattening, meaning that there is less payoff for investors willing to hold debt for a longer period of time. Many bond gurus believe that when short-term rates exceed long-term rates \u2014 a phenomenon known as inversion \u2014 the economy is headed toward recession. Hyman said while the recent flattening concerns him, he hasn't taken action to protect against an economic downturn just yet. \"I worry about the yield curve. I\u2019m a big fan of the yield curve, but it needs to go negative before I react to it,\" he added. \"I don\u2019t expect it to invert, I think bond yields will go up at some point before the fed funds rate gets to 3 percent. But if it inverts, I'll forecast a recession.\" At the latest reading, the spread between the yield on the 10-year note and the two-year note was 25.4 basis points, down from above 90 basis points early in the year.

Grogan | CNBC David Solomon Goldman Sachs is expected to name its president, David M. Solomon, as its next chief executive early this week, according to people briefed on the plan. The announcement would formally establish Mr. Solomon as the successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein as one of the most powerful executives on Wall Street. Mr. Blankfein, who presided over record earnings during his 12 years atop Goldman, will stay on for an interim period. Anointing Mr. Solomon, however, most likely makes it easier for him to put his future lieutenants in place. The announcement could be made as soon as Monday, according to people briefed on the plan who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. Mr. Solomon, 56, has been considered the heir apparent to Mr. Blankfein since he was named the firm\u2019s sole president in March. But a formal announcement of his ascent had not been expected until the fall. It was not clear what prompted Goldman, which is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, to decide that it would formalize its succession plan in midsummer. Mr. Blankfein, 63, led the firm through the 2008 financial crisis and reshaped its business model following the downturn. Now, the executive who once joked that he would die at his desk will turn over leadership of a firm that, despite its immense profits, is still adjusting. Goldman has been grappling with a trading division that is far less profitable than it was before the crisis, which prompted stiff new curbs on risk-taking. To make up for that shortfall, the firm has focused on new moneymaking opportunities in areas like consumer lending. It is also opening banking offices in midsize cities and laying the groundwork for a corporate cash-management business. Goldman was also one of two major American banks to earn less-than-stellar marks during the recent Federal Reserve stress tests. More from the New York Times: Goldman C.E.O. Blankfein Is Likely to Step Down in December Bank \u2018Stress Tests\u2019 Results Clear Way for Wall Street to Reward Investors Amazon's Curious Case of the $2,630.52 Used Paperback Mr. Solomon is a longtime investment banker who spent his formative years as a manager at Bear Stearns, where he helped run the bank\u2019s junk bonds division. He joined Goldman as a partner in 1999 to work with its leveraged finance team and in 2006 he was named co-head of its investment bank. He held that job for the next decade before being named co-president of Goldman late in 2016. A little over a year later, he was named sole president and, with that, became the likely successor to Mr. Blankfein. Mr. Solomon has said that priorities for the firm include working toward gender parity among its employees and improving the coordination between different divisions that serve the same clients. He has also been a big proponent of the firm\u2019s nascent push into consumer banking, Goldman officials say. Mr. Solomon, who works on strategy and deals with top executives at companies like Walt Disney Company, Uber and 3M, comes from one of the firm\u2019s mainstay divisions.

The company also reported, however, a slowdown in inflows amid increasing market uncertainty. Here is how the company's results fared compared with Wall Street estimates: Earnings: Adjusted $6.66 per share, vs $6.55 expected by Thomson ReutersRevenue: $3.605 billion, vs $3.594 billion forecastAssets under management: $6.299 trillion, vs $6.372 trillion forecast by StreetAccount BlackRock said its stronger-than-expected revenue was driven in part by base fees, performance fees and \"technology services revenue,\" while its higher-than-forecast profit got a boost from a lower corporate tax rate. The company's adjusted earnings per share grew by 28 percent on a year-over-year basis, while revenue increased by 11 percent. BlackRock's effective tax rate fell to 23.7 percent in the second quarter from 30.4 percent in the year-earlier period on an adjusted basis. The company's assets under management rose by 11 percent on a year-over-year basis, but still missed analyst expectations. CEO Larry Fink said the asset management industry has been hit with a slowdown in flows \"associated with investor uncertainty in the current market environment.\" Fink added in a statement, however, that \"our dialogue with clients and opportunities to provide long-term solutions are more robust than ever before.\" BlackRock shares fell 0.6 percent. Investors have been on edge recently as a trade war between some of the largest economies in the world heats up. Last week, the Trump administration unveiled a list Chinese goods it will potentially target with a 10 percent tariff. The list added up to $200 billion worth of items. The announcement came just days after both nations imposed $34 billion worth of tariffs on each other. Long-term net inflows at BlackRock totaled $14.5 billion, well below a StreetAccount estimate of $38 billion. Institutional investors had an outflow of $8.8 billion in the second quarter, while retail investors and BlackRock's iShares business raked in $5.5 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively, in long-term inflows. Overall net inflows amounted to $20 billion. The company's stock has fallen more than 1 percent this year, lagging the broader S&P 500 which is up nearly 5 percent. BlackRock's earnings report follows mixed results from some of the largest U.S. banks. Last week, J.P. Morgan Chase reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter on a surge in trade revenue. Citigroup, however, reported weaker-than-expected sales for the quarter as deposits and trading revenue disappointed. Earlier this year, BlackRock said it launched two exchange-traded funds that excluded gun manufacturers and retailers who sell guns to civilians. The move came in the aftermath of a horrific shooting at a school in Florida, which left 17 dead. The asset manager had also said it would use its voting power to influence how some civilian gun makers are run. BlackRock is the largest shareholder in Sturm Ruger and Smith & Wesson-parent American Outdoor Brands.

The five digital coins include cardano, basic attention token, stellar lumens, Zcash and 0x. \"It wouldn't surprise me to see these things up 20, 30, 40 percent over the weekend,\" digital trader Brian Kelly said Friday on \"Fast Money.\" Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, said he's \"long almost every single one of them\" but would probably choose Zcash and 0x first. The announcement came Friday in a blog post that read, \"these assets will require additional exploratory work and we cannot guarantee they will be listed for trading.\" The San Francisco-based company went on to say that some assets may have limited functions and that it has not yet determined if the coins are securities. In addition, some of them may only be available in select countries. All five assets moved higher after the announcement. Previously, with the entire cryptocurrency industry under increased regulatory scrutiny, Coinbase only traded four coins despite user demand for more. Kelly breaks it down for investors: Getty Images Cardano Brian Kelly said it is similar to ethereum. \"They have working network,\" he said. \"They have a live road map. That's important. That's what the [Securities and Exchange Commission] said was important, so it's not a security.\" Basic Attention Token This coin is unique in that it offers an ad-free experience, Kelly said. \"You can use Basic Attention Token to pay for content on the web.\" 0X Pronounced \"zero x,\" this is a decentralized exchange protocol that Kelly said is \"up and running.\" Stellar Lumens Kelly said this token is similar to ripple. Zcash This is a privacy token, \"so you can send stuff back and forth without people knowing,\" he said. Kelly said the digital asset platform Gemini has already said it's going to have Zcash on its platform. \"So this one is probably one of the most likely\" to be approved by Coinbase, Kelly said.

Facebook's market leading position in the advertising market is unmatched, according to Jefferies. The firm raised its price target to $240 from $215 for Facebook shares, predicting its second-quarter sales results will be above expectations. Jefferies also reiterated its buy rating for the company. \u201cWe see continued strength from advertisers seeking the best ROI online and FB continuing to deliver best-in-class capabilities for advertisers,\u201d analyst Brent Thill said in a note to clients Friday.

The analyst said the recently launched video offering for Instagram called IGTV will offer new monetization prospects for Facebook. He noted his checks with advertisers revealed higher pricing for the company\u2019s ads. As a result, Thill predicts Facebook will generate second-quarter revenue of $13.303 billion versus the $13.287 billion consensus estimate. Facebook shares declined by more than 10 percent in March after media coverage that data from tens of millions of Facebook profiles were improperly accessed by research firm Cambridge Analytica before the 2016 election. The data mishandling spurred international probes, an internal audit and an overhaul of Facebook's privacy policies. The company has admitted it didn't do enough to protect users' privacy and vowed to improve. The company's stock has since recovered all of those losses.

The company's earnings per share, however, topped estimates. Here is how Citigroup's second-quarter results fared against Wall Street estimates: Earnings: $1.63 per share vs $1.56 forecast by Thomson ReutersRevenue: $18.469 billion vs $18.512 billion expected by Reuters The company's stock fell by 2.2 percent. Citigroup delivered disappointing results for deposits and trading. Deposits for the quarter totaled $996.7 billion, below a StreetAccount estimate of $1.009 trillion. Meanwhile, fixed income trading revenue came in at $3.08 billion, slightly under a forecast of $3.11 billion. Equities trading took in $864 million, while analysts polled by StreetAccount expected a total of $1.1 billion. Vincent Isore | IP3 | Getty Images A Citibank branch in Hong Kong. Still, CEO Michael Corbat said in a statement that Citigroup \"drove strong year-over-year revenue growth in many of our businesses \u2013 including our International Consumer franchise, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Equities, and the Private Bank. And we continue to support our clients as evidenced by solid loan growth that was balanced across businesses and geographies.\" Sales from consumer banking and institutional clients totaled $8.25 billion and $9.691 billion, respectively, representing growth of 2 percent and 3 percent. The company also said its earnings per share grew by 27 percent on a year-over-year basis as net income rose 16 percent to $4.49 billion and as its shares outstanding decreased by 8 percent. Citigroup said the rise in net income was driven by a lower effective tax rate, which fell to 24 percent from 32 percent. Revenue rose nearly 2 percent from $18.155 billion. Shares of Citigroup were down more than 8 percent for the year heading into Friday\u2019s report, lagging peers such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase. Bank of America and J.P. Morgan were down more than 2 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Citigroup announced in late June that it would hike its quarterly dividend by 13 cents to 45 cents a share, and buy back $17.6 billion in stock over the next 12 months after passing the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress test. The bank reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter in April. Its results from that time period got a boost from lower corporate taxes and strong trading revenue. Earlier Friday, J.P. Morgan kicked off earnings season when it reported its second-quarter results. \"In the shadow of rival JPMorgan, Citigroup\u2019s results pale in comparison. The bank\u2019s growth in earnings was almost entirely driven by a lower corporate tax rate, rather than Citi\u2019s underlying operations. Citigroup\u2019s revenue growth was tepid at only 2%,\" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas. \"While expenses also declined in line with revenues, Citi will have to continue to pay close attention to expense management in the coming quarters.\" Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the corporate lending revenue figure. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat will be on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Monday at 3 p.m. ET. \u2014 CNBC's Hugh Son contributed to this report.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.52 points to 25,019.41, and the Nasdaq posted a small gain to close at a record 7,825.98.

President Donald Trump (C) arrives for a family picture during the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) summit at the NATO headquarters, in Brussels, on May 25, 2017. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump began telling the Europeans in 2015 that they had to: (a) cut their systematic and excessive trade surpluses with the U.S., (b) eliminate discriminatory trade rules and practices to open up markets for American firms and (c) stop free-riding on the U.S. for their security. Europeans ignored him, kept hurling insults at a would-be taskmaster who, they thought, was going to be ignominiously trashed well before the main American presidential contest in November 2016. But then, coming closer to the day when American voters would shock the world, Trump upped the game by saying that the European Union was an unfriendly bunch, at the service of Germany, and was set up to compete against American economic interests. Sadly, nothing happened since then. Europeans simply continued to ignore the U.S. president. So far this year, the EU is running a surplus at an annual rate of $158 billion on its American trades. Will Trump put his foot down? And all that with threats to retaliate aggressively in case Washington dared to change the status quo of the U.S.-EU trade relations. The message to Trump is: Just take it \u2014 and don\u2019t make waves. Germany \u2014 with its U.S. trade surplus soaring at an annual rate of 12 percent in the first five months of this year \u2014 is now the ringleader of EU attempts to scare Washington with a cozy political and economic rapprochement with China. Berlin was hosting last week the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to open large trade and investment flows with Beijing, and to embrace the Chinese call to oppose, together, \u201cAmerican protectionism\u201d in defense of \u201cthe multilateral trading system.\u201d And there is more. On Monday, Germany is leading the Europeans into an EU-China summit in Beijing, while the U.S. is struggling to (a) stop and reverse its nearly half-a-trillion dollar trade deficits with China, (b) protect American and other Western intellectual properties, (c) force structural economic changes in China and (d) fight the Chinese challenges to the Western world order. To top it all off, and presumably to reassure his Chinese friends, Germany\u2019s foreign minister was magisterially coaching the president of the United States, via a tabloid interview on Sunday, on how to treat the West\u2019s core interests on the world stage. Makes you wonder when Trump will put his foot down on all that nonsense. When Trump reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron that France would get much better trade treatment from the U.S. if it left the EU, one had to believe that Trump fully understood the economic and political challenge the EU poses to the United States. He repeated the same thought last week to British Prime Minister Theresa May, telling her that a soft Brexit (the U.K. remaining part of the EU\u2019s free-trade area) would compromise a post-Brexit American-British free-trade agreement. Trump understands that the EU is a customs union \u2014 an economic contraption that promotes intra-area trade, but kills trade with countries outside the EU. That is particularly the case with the French-imposed agricultural policy \u2014 an emblematic feature of the EU\u2019s protectionist fortress that Trump will never be able to open for Great Plains farmers. Who is the enemy? Europeans are flouting the trading clout they have. They, for example, don\u2019t want to reduce their 10 percent import tax on U.S. automobiles to the 2 percent the U.S. charges on EU-originating motor vehicles. Put very briefly, Trump is wasting time trying to change the existing trans-Atlantic trading regime. He should simply tell the German EU bosses that he wants balanced trade accounts \u2014 immediately. Let the Germans figure out how to do that. Incidentally, Trump should do the same thing with China. Let China decide how to balance its U.S. trade. And the U.S. should get out of the business of Chinese structural reforms. None of this means that Washington should tear down the G-20 (the world\u2019s main economic forum), the World Trade Organization or the International Monetary Fund. But it does mean that the U.S. should strongly and effectively defend its interests on all those global platforms \u2014 instead of complaining because it failed, or never even tried, to do so. On political and security issues, the U.S. has to start out by deciding what it wants to do with China and Russia. Here is an example: Trump is telling the Germans that they give billions of dollars to Russians for energy imports while expecting the U.S. to spend billions of dollars to defend them from Russia. What that means is that the U.S. (with Germany and the EU) has to decide what kind of security architecture it wants with Europe\u2019s largest country. Russia accounts for roughly 37 percent of Europe\u2019s landmass, and that area is home to about 75 percent of the Russian population. Quarreling with Europeans about their defense spending is also a useless exercise. Most European countries don\u2019t even know who the enemy is. Those in the south are concerned about terrorist attacks and huge inflows of migrants and refugees from Africa and the Middle East. Those in the north say they fear a Russian invasion \u2014 a fear their friends in the south call pure paranoia and a centuries-old hatred of Russia. Italy, for example, announced during the NATO summit last Thursday that it won\u2019t increase its defense spending from the current 1 percent of GDP, while its president and interior minister were fighting about what to do with a boat carrying hundreds of African migrants toward Italian ports. Similarly, on the same day, the Czech prime minister said he would not compromise his budget balance with higher military spending, adding, with a tinge of sarcasm, that the U.S. was pushing arms sales on Europe to narrow the trade gap. Investment thoughts The Europeans don\u2019t want to balance their accounts on American trades. Most of them also have no intention of increasing defense spending, leaving to the U.S. the burden of their security. Washington has to decide what it wants to do about both issues. Trade should be simple. Europeans should square their trade books with the U.S., or face limited access to American markets. The trans-Atlantic security could be tougher, because it may require an unlikely U.S.-European agreement on the place and role of Russia. The Europeans fear that a normalization of Washington-Moscow relations would reduce them to an irrelevant sideshow. Trade and security for the Atlantic community have been a proverbial can kicked down the road. Bravely, Trump has placed those difficult issues back at the top of his agenda, but he now looks like a magician who brought out the powers he does not know what to do with. Those unresolved trade and security problems will continue to unsettle the U.S. asset markets at a time when they are facing rising inflation, increasing budget deficits and a widening trade gap.

Morgan profit rises 18.3% from a year ago 8:20 AM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 01:47 J.P. Morgan Chase, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, posted record second-quarter profit of $8.32 billion, exceeding estimates as it posted stronger-than-expected trading results. Profit surged 18 percent, clobbering analyst estimates for a 9.4 percent increase. Earnings per share were $2.29 in the quarter, beating the $2.22 estimate. It was the 14th straight quarter that J.P. Morgan topped analysts' estimates, according to Barclays analysts. The company's revenue increase was less stark, rising 6 percent to $28.4 billion. In the company's trading division, led by Co-President Daniel Pinto, markets revenue rose 13 percent to $5.4 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates by a half-billion dollars. J.P. Morgan said at the end of May that it expected revenue from its trading division to be about flat from the year earlier because of several one-time charges, including a $100 million hit related to a tax-oriented fixed income unit. Analysts had expected bond and stock trading of $4.88 billion, according to a consensus from FactSet. \"There were more catalysts in the market\" that helped spur volatility and therefore trading, especially in the second half of the quarter, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ironically, it was signs of instability in global order that helped spark trading, including the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute, unrest in emerging markets and the European Union, she said. The bank's traders exceeded expectations in both bond and equities departments. Fixed-income trading generated $3.5 billion in revenue, compared with the $3.18 billion estimate, on strength across asset classes and improved commodities revenue, J.P. Morgan said. Stock trading yielded $2 billion in revenue, compared with the $1.7 billion estimate, fueled by derivatives and prime brokerage results. Helped by the closing of several mega-deals, investment banking revenue of $1.9 billion beat expectations of $1.7 billion. The firm's shares rose 0.69 percent as of 10:52 am New York time. J.P. Morgan fared better than rivals Wells Fargo and Citigroup, which were down 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. Wells Fargo missed profit expectations amid continuing fallout from its sales practice scandals, while Citigroup disappointed some expectations for revenue and bond trading. J.P. Morgan is the first major lender to report earnings, giving investors a glimpse into how the finance industry's Wall Street and Main Street businesses fared in the quarter. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon indicated that J.P. Morgan took advantage of strong economic growth in the bank's home market, citing strength across the company's major businesses, including growth in clients investment assets, credit card results and record investment banking fees amid a boom in mergers. \"We see good global economic growth, particularly in the U.S., where consumer and business sentiment is high,\" Dimon said. \"Because of this broad growth and the strong underlying performance across each of our businesses, the company delivered record results this quarter. We also want to acknowledge that global competition is getting stronger.\u201d Still, the company's total loans rose 4 percent to $948.4 billion, barely edging out analysts expectations for $944.5 billion. Analysts have cited concerns about slowing loan growth as a potential warning sign for the industry, which has underperformed the broader stock indexes this year. The company's yield on interest-earning assets, a highly watched figure of profitability in the banking world, was 2.46 percentage points, merely matching the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet. That was a 2 basis point decline from the first quarter, which is a potentially worrying trend for the industry. \u201cThe trading and investment banking part of the story looks better than the traditional banking aspect right now,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. \u201cThat\u2019s a more important read-through for companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley where that\u2019s a bigger part of the business.\u201d The performance of bank stocks has been puzzling this year. Despite lower taxes, Federal Reserve rate hikes, moves to ease regulation and accelerating economic growth, the shares of banks have underperformed the broader markets. The KBW Bank Index has declined 1.1 percent this year before Friday, lagging the S&P 500 by more than 5 percent points. One possibility, according to Charlie Peabody, analyst at Portales Partners, is that as the U.S. enters the late stages of its economic cycle, bank profitability has peaked. For the industry, banks have had to pay depositors more interest at a faster rate than they can increase loan rates for borrowers, he said. That\u2019s one reason banks tend to underperform at this stage of the cycle, he said. Within J.P. Morgan's credit card division, the company posted a quarterly charge of $330 million as customers took advantage of card rewards at a faster rate than the bank expected. It was across all of the company's credit cards, not just the Sapphire card, according to Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Executives in the card sector have talked about the heightened incentives being offered to lure customers as a \"rewards war,\" and J.P. Morgan helped heighten that competition with its Sapphire card. After reshuffling his key deputies and announcing the creation of a health-care start-up in January and disclosing plans for a soaring new headquarters in February, Dimon was relatively quiet in the second quarter. In May, the bank said it had submitted an application to China's securities regulator for a new majority-owned securities business there. Last month, J.P. Morgan, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon announced that Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard professor, would lead the health-care start-up. The bank also got approval from the Federal Reserve to boost its quarterly dividend to 80 cents per share from the current 56 cents in the third quarter and repurchase up to $20.7 billion in shares.

Huge sums of investor cash have poured into exchange-traded funds during this past year (and during the whole bull market) with billions of dollars sitting passively in funds betting on the very largest U.S. stocks. But new research suggests this money is betting on funds with a methodology that might not offer the best returns for the regular person over the long term. The weighting of stocks in most major indexes, and the ETFs tied to them, are based on market capitalization, meaning that big-company components can pull the index more than the little ones. For example, a 20 percent move in Apple can shift the entire S&P 500 by more than half a percent. show chapters Vanguard eliminates almost all ETF trading fees 10:29 AM ET Wed, 1 Aug 2018 | 02:02 An equal-weighted index, on the other hand, treats all the companies equally in terms of how they can influence the group as a whole and in many cases, offered a better return to investors over the last 20 years, according to Pablo Fernandez, a finance professor at the University of Navarra in Spain. For example, researchers there showed that if an investor had put $100 in the S&P 500 in January 2000, the sum would be worth $252.60 in April 2018; alternatively, $2.50 invested unweighted in the largest 40 companies in the S&P 1500 would be worth $273.10 in April 2018. That disparity grows even more pronounced as the size of the companies shrinks: $5 invested unweighted in each of the 20 smallest companies in the S&P 1500 in January 2000 would now be worth at least $36,000. To be sure, the numbers cited by the paper may be skewed slightly since large cap technology stocks were gutted in the Dotcom bubble bust of March 2000. And the return numbers alone do not represent associated risks for each index with smaller companies sometimes being much more volatile. Still, this debate is not a new one and it's worth analyzing given that many of the globe's most popular ETFs use a market-weighted methodology. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) \u2014 the largest ETF on the market with $261 billion in assets under management \u2014 tracks a market-cap weighted index of the S&P 500. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, runs the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), another S&P 500-tracking fund. Investors have poured more than $17 billion into that ETF over the past year, according to FactSet fund flow data; Vanguard's S&P 500 fund drew nearly $12 billion over the same time. \u201cWe document that unweighted indexes have outperformed weighted indexes and that the S&P 400 and the S&P 600 have outperformed the S&P 500,\" the University of Navarra researchers wrote. The S&P 400 tracks midcaps while the S&P 600 tracks small caps. The debate Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates says a simple equal-weighted strategy can do even better when combined with regular rebalancing. Rebalancing is essentially trimming stocks that have outperformed and buying those that have underperformed given a historical tendency for prices to revert to an average. In essence, Brightman added, it\u2019s betting against the current Wall Street momentum darlings in favor of stocks that have underwhelmed or scared investors. \u201cOne can turn that mean reversion into profits by rebalancing their portfolio by selling securities that have outperformed and buying securities that have underperformed,\u201d he added. That strategy, the CIO said, provided about a 2-percent premium over the market over several decades. His firm, founded by Rob Arnott, has long advocated for weighting stocks by fundamental measures to garner better passive returns than the industry norm. \u201cWe use the fundamental index, which targets an invest amount for each company which is proportional to its fundamental size. Things like size, cash flow and dividends,\u201d said Brightman. To be sure, though, equal weighed indexes don\u2019t always outperform their market weighted cousins, especially during prolonged outperformance or underperformance in isolated areas of the market. Should a select few firms (or a sector) consistently outperform, for example, each time an investor rebalances their portfolio back to equal, they could be missing out on future gains in those areas. \u201cYou would have done terribly with your equal-weighted strategy during the 1990s, during the dotcom bubble,\u201d Brightman said. \u201cIf you decided to present this to a board or a committee in 1995, by 1997 or 1998 you\u2019d think you were really stupid. However, you would have dramatically outperformed the market in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.\u201d The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which replicates the performance of the equal-weighed S&P 500 index has returned 4.2 percent so far this year against the S&P 500\u2019s 5.8 percent return. Much of that disparity is likely due to the prolonged outperformance in the larger technology stocks, which have a bigger weighting in the S&P 500.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer signs for a purchase with a chip credit card at a Wal-Mart location in Burbank, California. Savvy credit-card users have forced J.P. Morgan Chase to pony up more in rewards payments than the bank originally projected. Buried in an otherwise positive second-quarter earnings report Friday, in which the bank announced a record $8.32 billion profit, was the admission that credit-card customers were redeeming points faster than anticipated, resulting in a $330 million charge. \u201cThis is maybe larger than we have seen over the course of the last several years,\u201d said Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer, during a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe do pretty regularly review our rewards liability in light of evolving consumer behavior.\u201d Credit-card issuers scrambling to sign coveted high-spenders have sparked a rewards war in recent years. J.P. Morgan ratcheted up the competition in 2016 with its Sapphire Reserve card, which came with lavish perks including a 100,000-point signing bonus and triple rewards for travel and dining. The initial run of that card sapped quarterly profit by as much as $300 million, the bank said in December 2016. show chapters Banks reporting mixed results 10:54 AM ET Fri, 13 July 2018 | 02:15 The bank\u2019s recent charge may indicate that consumers are simply getting smarter with rewards programs, according to Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride. In online forums devoted to credit-card usage, consumers boast about using spreadsheets and smartphone apps to stay on top of their credit. \u201cThere\u2019s a subset of savvy credit-card users who are diligent about maximizing their usage to capture the biggest benefit they can,\u201d McBride said. These consumers, he said, only use the cards in categories that pay the richest points. For instance, they would whip out a Sapphire card for dining and travel but switch to Chase\u2019s Freedom card to pay for purchases in the rotating category that\u2019s rewarded most, such as gas stations and drug stores. J.P. Morgan\u2019s Lake said that the recent charge, coming from Sapphire and other cards, is a good thing because it shows how engaged users are. The cards division has seen strong loan growth, modest charge-offs and record low attrition rates, she said, alleviating fears from some analysts that customers would stop using the plastic after redeeming the sign-on bonus. Chase's card customers, especially those picked up in the last couple of years, have strong spending patterns, Lake said. \u201cEngaged customers bring us more spend, they bring us more of their share of wallet.\u201d WATCH: JP Morgan profit up over 18 percent from last year show chapters J.P.

The veteran bank analyst made those comments after three major American banks kicked off the sector\u2019s earnings season on Friday with mixed results: J.P. Morgan Chase beat estimates, while Citigroup and Wells Fargo fell short of expectations. But one thing in common across those three banks is that none has grown their capital by much from one year ago, according to Bove. Capital refers to the amount of assets a bank holds in excess of its liabilities. It's an indication of a bank's financial strength and its ability to withstand a crisis. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have capital in a capital-intensive industry, you\u2019re telling the world you can\u2019t grow. And I actually think that is the critical variable which is impacting these stocks more than anything,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rundown\u201d on Monday. The banks have met U.S. regulator\u2019s requirement to set aside capital to be \u201csafe and sound,\u201d the analyst explained. But they have chosen to use additional money that they have to increase dividend payouts and buy back shares instead of investing in growing their businesses, Bove added. \u201cIf you have a dime of capital, that dime is invested somewhere and is giving you a return right now; if you get rid of that dime, you\u2019re going to lose the return that you\u2019re getting on that dime and you\u2019re basically going to lower your secular growth rate,\u201d he said.

The stock slipped as the company said legal and regulatory costs increased. Earnings of $5.98 per share beat the $4.66 estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Companywide revenue rose 19 percent to $9.40 billion, higher than the $8.74 billion estimate. Three of the New York-based bank's four main businesses all posted \"surprisingly strong\" results, thanks to higher private equity gains and fees from equity issuance, according to Atlantic Equities. Goldman said non-compensation expenses surged 24 percent to $2.66 billion from a year earlier after setting aside more money for litigation and regulatory proceedings. That was about $200 million more than analysts had been expecting. The bank's shares declined 1.2 percent at 11:24 a.m. in New York trading. Goldman's traders essentially matched expectations, unlike at rival J.P. Morgan Chase where bond and stock traders posted stronger-than-expected results. The fixed income trading business generated $1.68 billion in revenue, compared with analysts' expectations for $1.65 billion. Equity trading produced $1.89 billion, slightly below the $1.91 billion estimate. The bank also cited trading conditions that were \"generally less favorable\" compared with the start of the year. \"In the equities business, the fact is, you were flat year over year in the second quarter, at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average 20 percent,\" said Guy Moszkowski, analyst at Autonomous Research, during a conference call. The firm's investing and lending division, sometimes referred to as Goldman's merchant bank, posted a 23 percent increase in revenue to $1.94 billion on sales of private equity stakes, exceeding the estimate by almost $300 million. Investment banking generated 18 percent more revenue, rising to $2.05 billion, $210 million more than expected, mostly driven by strength from initial public offerings. Investment management posted a 20 percent increase in revenue to $1.84 billion, $160 million more than expected. \"It was disappointing that much of the revenue beat came from\" the investing and lending and investment management units, Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW said in a research note. \"We expect shares to be weak relative to peers as investors will not like a beat based on episodic revenues.\" On the eve of celebrating its 150th anniversary, Goldman is at a crossroads. After 12 years running the investment bank, Blankfein announced that David Solomon, the bank's current president, willtake over as CEO on Oct. 1 and add the chairman title at the start of next year. Stung by an industrywide slowdown in trading and restrictions on risk-taking, Goldman has yet to regain the profitability it had in the wake of the financial crisis. The new CEO will have to focus on the firm's historic strengths of trading and deal-making, while aggressively expanding a new consumer-facing business. Last month, Goldman was forced to maintain its dividend and share buyback plans unchanged from last year after fumbling a key part of its annual stress test. Its shares are 9.2 percent lower this year before Tuesday, underperforming rivals including J. P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley and the broader indexes. Here\u2019s what Wall Street expected: Earnings: $4.66 per share, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue: $8.74 billion, an 11 percent increase, according to the average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters.Trading revenue: Fixed income at $1.65 billion, equities at $1.91 billion, according to FactSet.

Only Amazon Prime members can take advantage of Prime Day discounts, which starts Monday at 3 p.m. EDT this year. \u201cAmazon Prime Day returns for the 4th time \u2026 and is likely to be the biggest one ever,\u201d analyst John Blackledge said in a note to clients Monday. \"Beyond adding further revenue/GMV, Prime Day is a key driver of Prime subs, which we view as the core driver of LT eCommerce growth.\u201d Amazon raised the price of its annual Prime plan to $119 from $99 in May. show chapters How to decide if Amazon Prime is worth the price 4:38 PM ET Fri, 24 Aug 2018 | 02:55 Blackledge reiterated his outperform rating and raised his price target to $2,100 from $2,000 for Amazon shares, representing 16 percent upside to Friday\u2019s close. The analyst said the Prime Day promotions will increase the company's Echo device sales and Prime subscriber base. He noted Prime households buy on average about 3.5 times per month versus two times for the regular Amazon consumer, according to Cowen's survey. Another Wall Street analyst explained the ecosystem surrounding Prime is what makes Amazon special. \u201cEvery year, Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices are heavily promoted, and this year, we expect more of the same, augmented by similar promotions on Alexa devices,\u201d Moody\u2019s analyst Charles O\u2019Shea said in a note to clients Monday. \u201dThis is where we believe the true value of Prime lies \u2013 the kind of content it offers members. Anyone can offer cutthroat shipping promotions if they have the stomach (and shareholders!) willing to absorb the costs, but excluding the likes of Apple, no one in retail can match the content ecosystem of Prime.\u201d Not only does Prime Day help the company\u2019s sales, it is also benefits Amazon\u2019s stock price. Using Kensho, a quantitative tool used by hedge funds, CNBC found Amazon rose 1.9 percent on average during Prime Day week in the last three instances. The Amazon return approximately doubled the S&P 500\u2019s performance in the same time periods. Amazon shares rose 0.6 percent to a record on Monday.

rebounding rally, not just FANG 3:36 PM ET Tue, 17 July 2018 | 03:12 The Nasdaq Composite hit a record high on Tuesday as strong gains in Amazon and a rebound in Netflix shares led to a big comeback in tech stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent to 7,855.12, after falling as much as 0.7 percent, as Amazon reached an all-time high. Meanwhile, Netflix closed just 5.2 percent lower after falling as much as 14.1 percent earlier in the session. Netflix initially plunged after reporting weaker-than-expected subscriber growth. The streaming giant said Monday afternoon that domestic subscribers grew by 670,000 in the previous quarter, while international additions rose by 4.5 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected domestic gains of 1.23 million and 5.11 million new international subscribers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the drop presented a \"compelling\" buying opportunity, noting the company \"never misses twice\" when it comes to subscriber growth. \"Historically, following a net adds miss, Netflix tends to set guidance cautiously and deliver large beats in the following quarters,\u201d analyst Nat Schindler said in a note to clients Monday. Netflix's steep decline dragged down other major tech stocks. Google-parent Alphabet dropped as much as 1.2 percent, while Amazon and Facebook fell more than 1 percent earlier in the session. Alphabet and Facebook recovered to rise by 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, and reach record highs. Amazon rose 1.2 percent after data from Feedvisor showed strong sales growth for the first 12 hours of Prime Day compared to last year. Earlier, Amazon fell 1.4 percent amid glitches during the company's annual sales event. \"The bounce-back is definitely warranted,\" said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. \"The reason those stocks went down together is because of three letters: ETFs.\" \"There are so many ETFs dominated by these names,\" he said, noting the stocks were able to come back once the selling in those funds subsided. Tech is the best-performing sector in the market this year, rising nearly 15 percent through Monday\u2019s close. Also, just a handful of tech shares are responsible for more than 80 percent of the S&P 500's gains this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also got a boost from tech as well as strong earnings from Johnson & Johnson. The Dow rose 55.53 points to 25,119.89, with Johnson & Johnson outperforming. The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to close at 2,809.55, led by gains in tech and consumer staples. Both indexes fell as much as 74.75 points and 0.3 percent, respectively. Johnson & Johnson rose 3.5 percent after reporting earnings and revenue that topped expectations. Goldman Sachs also posted better-than-expected earnings, but its stock fell 0.6 percent. The bank also announced that David Solomon will take over the CEO role from Lloyd Blankfein on Oct. 1. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab jumped 3.6 percent on stronger-than-forecast results. The earnings season \u201cis off to a great start,\u201d said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. \u201cUp until now, more than 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported have beaten earnings estimates.\u201d \u201cMost importantly, third-quarter estimates are only inching down thus far. That\u2019s a good thing because they\u2019re not falling off a cliff,\u201d Raich said. \u201cUp until this year, that was the trend every quarter for six or seven years.\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in testimony to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs that he supports more rate hike given the \u201cconsiderably stronger\u201d economic growth.

Venture capitalist Peter Thiel is placing a new bet in the crypto space. The early Facebook investor was a part of Cayman Islands start-up Block.one\u2019s most recent funding round announced Monday. The company recently raised a record $4 billion to fund its blockchain platform EOSIO through a process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. The fundraising more than doubled the next biggest offering of that type, and eclipsed the world's biggest initial public offerings on stock exchanges this year before its flagship product even went live. \u201cAs Block.one prepares to announce its future plans, we\u2019re excited to welcome key strategic investors aligned with our values of creating a more secure and connected world,\u201d Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer said in a press release. The company did not give a dollar amount in the announcement. Well-known Chinese start-up Bitmain, which dominates the bitcoin \"mining\" industry, also participated in the funding round. According to a recent Bernstein analysis, the company likely made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did in the same year. Thiel co-founded PayPal in 1998, was one of the first outside investors in Facebook. Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm he co-founded, began amassing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency including bitcoin in 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported in January, citing people familiar with the matter. In March, Thiel said he was \"long bitcoin\u201d and highlighted its possibility of becoming a gold-like safe-haven investment. The billionaire backed the idea of bitcoin becoming a store of value instead of a go-to currency for daily transactions. Bitcoin prices have struggled since. The cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 50 percent this year, after climbing to almost $20,000 in December. Block.one, was featured in a March episode of HBO's \"Last Week Tonight,\" where host John Oliver warned viewers about the \"speculative mania\" and risks of investing in cryptocurrency. \"It can be incredibly hard to tell which companies are for real,\" Oliver said during the episode, which has 5.98 million views on YouTube. \"If you want a good example of this, look at Block.one, which has raised $1.5 billion.\" Oliver listed a number of concerns: An apparent lack of seriousness by advisor and noted early bitcoin investor Brock Pierce, the exponential pace of fundraising relative to established tech giants such as Facebook, and a Wall Street Journal report calling Block.one \"a software startup that doesn't plan to sell any software.\" The cryptocurrency eos is now the fifth biggest by market capitalization, worth roughly total $7.2 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. It has fared better than most cryptocurrencies this year, down only 8 percent year to date in what has been a volatile bear market. Eos was up about 10 percent as of Thursday evening, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The system, according to its founders, will support more efficient operations for \"decentralized applications\" than existing platforms such as ethereum. If EOSIO is successful, advocates say it could bring on much greater adoption of cryptocurrency-related technology.

So it was surprising that his firm, a San Francisco-based digital currency exchange, has had \"unprecedented\" interest from institutional investors throughout 2017, he said. The \"institutional conversations have become more and more profound,\" White said. In response, his firm has opened a New York office and launched new products and services. Last Friday, Coinbase, which is also the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., announced it was considering adding five coins to its platform, including cardano, basic attention token, stellar lumens, Zcash and 0x. All five assets moved higher after the announcement. \"The idea of adding new assets is very simply: our customers want it,\" White said. But so far, none of the coins have been approved, and it's not yet been determined if they are securities. The company said in a blog post on Friday that some of the assets may have limited functions, and may only be available in some countries. The firm has previously been cautious about the addition of new tokens despite user demand, as the cryptocurrency universe endured increased regulatory scrutiny. Up until now, Coinbase has only listed four coins on its platform. \"We have a long-term vision for the space,\" White said. \"And we are focused on building the exchange, the wallet, the custodian, that allows capital to move into the space.\" Omar Marques | SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty Images People pass by a Bitcoin exchange shop. Not everyone is as bullish on digital currency though. Investor and author Kevin O'Leary is bearish on cryptocurrency \u2014 especially bitcoin, which was priced around $6,655 Monday at 5:30 p.m. ET. \"But until you know with certainty if you\u2019re an asset allocator and you\u2019re running a sovereign fund or you\u2019re doing a pension plan for some state. You\u2019re not going to put a dime into this stuff,\" O'Leary said on \"Fast Money\" Monday. In order for cryptocurrency to be a lucrative investment, O'Leary said, investors need to know \"it\u2019s transparent; it\u2019s compliant; and the regulators are on board.\" \"And then you\u2019ll see real money. Right now it\u2019s fringe.\" But White pointed out that those things don't happen overnight. \"Those are the exact three things Coinbase is working on,\" he said. \"What we\u2019re seeing though, with institutions, is that they want absolutely the right regulatory structure around it.\" \"People are valuing these assets very differently,\" White said. \"Whether they\u2019re crypto hedge funds or the retail investor. The core metrics that people look at though, are: What are the daily transactions? How much volume\u2019s moving through it? How many people are building on top of it?\" \"The end of the day these are open protocols that facilitate the kind of value, creation and movement,\" he said.

Solomon's ascent has been expected since he was named sole president of Goldman Sachs in March, edging out his former Co-President Harvey Schwartz. But the timing of the announcement is coming sooner than first thought; earlier in the year, a formal announcement was expected in the fall. Blankfein, 63, is the longest-tenured CEO of a major Wall Street bank along with J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who started a few months before him in 2006. The announcement of Blankfein's eventual departure marks the end of a period that saw Goldman Sachs navigate the U.S. housing boom, the financial crisis that sprang from its excesses and a post-crisis period where the firm's vaunted trading businesses struggled to generate as much profit. His successor must focus on the bank's historic strengths in trading and investment banking advisory while continuing to build out the bank's new consumer-facing businesses, like its Marcus brand. The consumer business offers savings accounts and loans, but could ultimately spread to credit cards, mortgages, car loans, life and health insurance through Marcus, according to a May presentation from the bank. \"We're now building a digital consumer finance platform,\" Solomon said at the time. \"We think digital finance is at a very, very interesting pivot point. And we think we're in a position where we can be part of the disruption.\" Solomon, who is an electronic dance music disc jockey in his spare time, has said employee diversity is a priority at Goldman Sachs and has cited his unusual hobby as an ice breaker in conversations with junior bankers. Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 1.9 percent at 1:39 p.m. in New York trading amid a broad rally in bank stocks. The company's stock has declined 9.5 percent this year.

Solomon, 56, will now have time to put his stamp on the organization after officially being named as the incoming CEO. He will take on the chief executive role on Oct. 1, and Blankfein will remain chairman until the end of the year. Solomon will assume the dual titles of chairman and CEO after that. The announcement marks the end of an era. Under Lloyd Blankfein's 12-year tenure, Goldman successfully navigated the financial crisis, making lucrative bets that the U.S. housing market would collapse. It stumbled in the public eye after being labeled a \"vampire squid\" by Rolling Stone magazine, but the true test for management came later, as the firm's vaunted trading businesses struggled under placid markets and heightened post-crisis regulation. That brought criticism from investors and analysts that the bank was slow to adjust to the new realities. In response, Goldman unveiled a $5 billion revenue-boosting project in September, disclosing a plan to broaden its client base, find growth in smaller markets and push into consumer retail products. The consumer business offers savings accounts and loans, but could ultimately spread to credit cards, mortgages, car loans and life and health insurance through its Marcus brand, according to a May presentation from the bank. Blankfein told employees in an email on Tuesday that the reality of the transition that is now in motion has been an opportunity to reflect on his time there. \"When I've been asked about succession in the past, it's always been hard for me to imagine leaving. When times are tougher, you can't leave. And, when times are better, you don't want to leave.\" he said. \"Today, I don\u2019t want to retire from Goldman Sachs, but by my own perhaps convoluted logic, it feels like the right time.\" Solomon worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns before joining Goldman as a partner in 1999. His ascent has been expected since he was named sole president of the bank in March, edging out his former co-President Harvey Schwartz. But the timing of the announcement came more quickly than many thought it would. It hadn't been expected until the fall. Blankfein will retire from Goldman as chairman at the end of the year and will take the title senior chairman after his retirement. Solomon will join the bank's board on Oct. 1. In a statement, Blankfein called Solomon the \"right person\" to lead the bank. And in his email to employees, Blankfein added, \"I want to congratulate David. He's been a terrific partner to me and I look forward to watching him lead Goldman Sachs for years to come.\" A former global co-head of investment banking, Solomon will have to focus on the Goldman's historic strengths in trading and advisory while also building out the firm's nascent businesses. Goldman's shares have lagged rivals this year, declining 10 percent. Solomon, who is an electronic dance music disc jockey in his spare time under the name DJ D-Sol, has said employee diversity is a priority at Goldman and has cited his unusual hobby as an ice breaker in conversations with junior bankers. \u201cI am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to lead Goldman Sachs and I appreciate the confidence Lloyd and the Board of Directors have placed in me,\u201d Solomon said in a statement. \u201cI am excited about the opportunities for growth and know how vital our culture of client service and teamwork is to our success.\u201d Separately, Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations on strong revenue from its investment management and investing and lending divisions.

The tech giant has put its weight behind a so-called \u201cstablecoin,\u201d a digital token that, in principle, is tied to an existing government-backed currency, in order to reduce the volatility associated with virtual currencies. In this case, the cryptocurrency, called \u201cStronghold USD,\u201d is backed by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured U.S. dollars, IBM said Tuesday, with reserves being held by blockchain-focused asset manager Prime Trust. IBM said it will experiment with the virtual greenback to explore ways of helping banks and other financial institutions process payments faster and more securely. The aim of stablecoins is to reduce the volatility that is commonplace in the cryptocurrency market. But it follows much controversy surrounding a well-known stablecoin known as tether, which has been accused of being used to prop-up the price of bitcoin during last year\u2019s spike in value. Tether is also a contentious subject in the cryptocurrency world due to concerns surrounding its U.S. dollar reserves. The fear is that Tether Limited, the company behind the tether coin, does not hold enough dollars to account for the number of tokens in circulation. show chapters IBM CEO: Our blockchain runs on our public cloud 8:05 AM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 02:16 The move marks a further push by the decades-old IT powerhouse into the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are the virtual ledgers on which cryptocurrency transactions are recorded. Earlier this year, IBM teamed up with environmental tech start-up Veridium to turn carbon credits \u2014 tradable instruments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 into digital tokens. The company also uses blockchain firm Stellar's digital tokens, lumens, to enable faster payments between a consortium of banks. IBM said Stronghold\u2019s stablecoin will rely on the platform developed by Stellar, which was co-founded by former Ripple executive Jed McCaleb in 2014. Big Blue's blockchain is different to the original one that underpins bitcoin. Whereas the bitcoin blockchain is public and allows anyone to participate, IBM\u2019s only allows a certain number of trusted parties to use it. The entire cryptocurrency market is currently worth more than $270 billion, according to industry website CoinMarketCap. It has seen a significant downturn since the start of the year, with the world\u2019s best-known digital currency, bitcoin, falling steeply from its record high near $20,000 late last year to around $6,700 as of Tuesday.

CNBC parent Comcast was engaged in a bidding war with Disney over the Fox assets. Recently Disney threw some cash into its own bid, raising its offer to $71 billion and edging out Comcast's bid of $65 billion in cash. Comcast has also been bidding for Britain's Sky, which is 39 percent owned by Fox. Last week, Fox raised its bid for the remaining portion of Sky it doesn't own, with a new offer valuing the deal at $32.5 billion. And then last week Comcast raised its bid, valuing the company at $34 billion. Sources told CNBC's Faber that Comcast is focused on its bidding for Sky. The government's decision to appeal a recent court ruling allowing AT&T to go ahead with its purchase of Time Warner may be giving Comcast reason to pause in its pursuit of the Fox assets, Faber said Monday on CNBC. The government had tried to block the AT&T deal on competitive grounds. There is also a belief, Faber said, that Rupert Murdoch, Fox's executive co-chairman whose family has a nearly 39 percent stake in Twenty-First Century Fox Class B shares, favors a deal with Disney.

The core theory of Netflix's wild run to a $175 billion valuation hasn't been debunked with one quarter of slower growth than forecast. But the Q2 miss might make some investors reconsider why they're betting on Netflix in the first place. The basic hypothesis for bulls is that Netflix is on its way massive global subscriber growth that will eat away at legacy media companies. As I wrote about here, analysts nearly universally expect Netflix subscribers to keep soaring -- to 200 million and higher by 2020. Nothing announced today undercuts that general idea. Netflix again announced significant growth, adding 5.2 million customers to 130 million global subscribers. The problem was the company's own internal prediction pegged that quarterly number at 6.2 million. Missing by 1 million customers is a lot, especially because Netflix has gained a reputation for beating its own estimates. Netflix also didn't really offer a reason, other than blaming their own forecasting models. That's why the stock is down about 14 percent in after-hours trading. Netflix, itself, called the quarterly results \"not stellar\" in its letter to shareholders. show chapters Wall Street reacts to Netflix 6:06 PM ET Mon, 16 July 2018 | 06:24 If you thought Netflix would erode legacy media by outspending many of today's players (Lionsgate, Viacom, AMC, etc.), spending $22.5 billion per year on content by 2022 like Goldman Sachs reportedly predicted, nothing announced today changes that thesis. As Daniel Ives from GBH Insights wrote in a note to clients, \"We believe this is a speed bump rather than the start of a negative sub trend for Netflix, as the streaming market and content arms race continues to be a major tailwind for the company over the next 12 to 18 months.\" Ives has a target of $500 a share on the stock. The problem is Netflix's huge content spend is aided by its valuation. When you increase spending and your stock rises, that's a sign to keep increasing spending. When your stock starts moving the other direction over a sustained period of time, maybe you start pulling back on those gaudy spending predictions. Nothing today yet suggests Netflix has changed its long-term focus -- and CEO Reed Hastings' attention to his company's long-term focus is unwavering. He's even posted it on the company's website. But maintaining a high valuation certainly helps accelerate the strategy. If the valuation starts to shrink, the entire thesis could come under question. show chapters Netflix misses own estimates, but analysts not worried 4:46 PM ET Mon, 16 July 2018 | 05:40 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/01/103350109-GettyImages-480659696.jpg?v=1531753846", "time": "2018-07-16T11:59:14-0400", "author": "Patrick T.

Shares of Citigroup and Bank of America were still lower year to date, while J.P. Morgan stock was about 1 percent higher so far in 2018. Cramer has previously said Wall Street had written off the bank stocks' weakness as a casualty of the flattening yield curve. Money managers were making the calculation that if interest rates were similar for long-term and short-term loans, banks would shy away from longer-term lending, a key line of business for the big banks. The \"Mad Money\" host said on Monday that Bank of America continued to make money on deposits (also referred to as net interest margin), one of the key signs of success for financial companies. He said Citigroup's earnings were also good but the reaction on Wall Street was less than enthusiastic with the bank's shares falling more than 2 percent on Friday. \"People can't wait to sell these stocks,\" Cramer said.

The S&P 500 has risen nearly 5 percent this year, but the lion\u2019s share of that gain comes from a small number of technology stocks. Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Apple are responsible for 83 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s return for 2018. Overall, tech shares are up more than 15 percent in 2018 and 30 percent over the past 12 months. \u201cIf you strip out a handful of outperforming tech stocks, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling,\u201d Fink, CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty.\u201d He added that \u201cmarket dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future.\u201d Investors have been on edge recently as a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies has escalated. Last week, the Trump administration unveiled a list of $200 billion in Chinese goods it will potentially target with 10 percent tariffs. The announcement came just days after both nations imposed tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods. Global investors have also dealt with political uncertainty as populist candidates have emerged victorious in elections in Europe and Latin America. \u201cSome of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested as trade frictions escalate to new levels,\u201d Fink said. \u201cGovernments are changing heads in Italy and Mexico and further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors' confidence.\u201d Fink made his comments after BlackRock reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for the second quarter, though it also announced a slowdown in investment inflows amid the increasing uncertainty in the market.

Many industry experts believe that increased involvement from institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space will boost confidence in an otherwise dubious market. \u201cIt definitely is causing some excitement,\u201d Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said of the report on Monday. \u201cThe idea of big financial firms moving into crypto certainly isn\u2019t new, and this is a trend we\u2019ve been noticing gaining strength since November.\u201d Last year, two trading giants, CME Group and the CBOE, launched bitcoin futures products, lifting hopes of institutional involvement in cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies have been shrouded in doubt due to excessive volatility in the market resulting in wild price swings. Bitcoin soared close to $20,000 late last year but has declined since, with transaction volumes falling significantly.

Executives said it was the 14th straight quarter the company posted positive operating leverage, or increased profit by turning levers including costs. The company's shares rose more than 4 percent at 2:30 p.m. New York trading. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said it managed to boost revenue while cutting expenses more than analysts had expected. The lender trimmed costs by 5 percent to $13.3 billion, beating the $13.5 billion forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Meanwhile, revenue rose 3 percent to $22.6 billion, compared with the $22.3 billion estimate, excluding a year ago-gain tied to a business sale. The company's earnings per share surged 43 percent to 63 cents per share, crushing the 57 cent per share estimate. Still, of all the figures on the bank's income statement for the quarter, the most stark change was a 43 percent drop in the bank's income taxes to $1.7 billion from $3 billion. That looked to be the single biggest factor in the bank's profit increase in the quarter. The Trump administration's tax cut, which took effect this year, also allowed the company to announce a new $500 million technology investment, Bank of America said. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan has cleaned up much of the mess he inherited when a predecessor purchased subprime lender Countrywide Financial a decade ago. He has since focused on methodically reducing costs while looking for modest profit opportunities, often repeating his mantra of \u201cresponsible growth.\u201d The company benefited from a U.S. economy in growth mode, lower taxes after the administration's overhaul, higher interest rates and an environment in which consumers are still repaying loans. Bank of America set aside $800 million for credit losses in the quarter, less than the $973.5 million expected by analysts. Nonperforming loans fell half a billion dollars from the first quarter of 2018 on improvements in consumer and commercial debt. While the bank grew loans and leases to $935.8 billion, that was below the $942 billion estimate. \"Responsible growth continued to deliver as a driver for every area of the company,\" Moynihan said in a statement. \"We grew consumer and commercial loans; we grew deposits; we grew assets within our Merrill Edge business; we generated more net new households in Merrill Lynch; and we supported more institutional client activity.\" Still, the company\u2019s shares have trailed other banks and the broader stock indexes this year, declining 3.3 percent before Monday. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan will appear on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.

The new price target is 29 percent higher than Friday's closing price. On Thursday IDC said preliminary results showed shipments of traditional desktop, notebook and workstation PCs rose 2.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the same period last year, the strongest growth rate in more than six years. \u201cGiven the many positive PC industry data points for 2Q18, we believe shipments for AMD's Zen-based PC CPU line up tracked in-line to slightly better than management's guidance,\u201d analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cWe continue recommending the AMD shares as a higher percentage of its revenue transitions to the newer, higher margin Zen-based CPUs.\u201d AMD shares rose 1.9 percent Monday after the report.

The analyst estimates AMD's third-quarter gross profit margin will rise to 37.7 percent from 37 percent in the second quarter, citing the positive sales trends in the PC market. \u201cAdditional strength was driven by business volume, premium notebooks, and gaming PCs, which benefitted from moderating graphic card prices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect AMD to benefit from the stronger than expected results, especially given the trends for enterprise, gaming, and high-end notebooks, all markets in which AMD has improved its competitive position through its Ryzen processors.\u201d Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/15/103471508-GettyImages-515617936.jpg?v=1531851932", "time": "2018-07-17T14:41:31-0400", "author": "Matthew Busch | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker will meet next week to discuss a possible reduction of auto tariffs for several key trade partners, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/eu-will-reportedly-talk-with-trump-to-reduce-auto-tariffs-gm-rises.html", "title": "EU will reportedly talk with Trump to reduce auto tariffs, GM rises", "keywords": [{"term": "Matthew Busch", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Arlington", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Texas", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "European Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "next week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bloomberg News", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Juncker", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Trump the European Union's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "nearly a month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "EU", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the White House", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The European Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "General Motors", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "as much as 2.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "1.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Fiat Chrysler", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ferrari", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$34 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Chinese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$200 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}], "body": " Matthew Busch | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee prepares to install the hood on a sports utility vehicle at the General Motors assembly plant in Arlington, Texas. U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet next week to discuss a possible reduction of auto tariffs for several key trade partners, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Shares of General Motors and other automakers rose on the report. Citing two sources with knowledge of with the situation, Bloomberg said Juncker will likely convey to Trump the European Union's willingness to lower auto tariffs between the two sides and other major car-exporting countries. The report comes nearly a month after Trump threatened to raise tariffs to 20 percent from 2.5 percent on European cars coming into the U.S. The U.S. has already slapped tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports. CNBC reached out to the White House for comment, but they did not respond immediately. The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment, either. General Motors jumped to trade as much as 2.4 percent higher, before holding up 1.5 percent. Shares of Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari both rose to trade more than 1 percent higher. The Trump administration has taken a more protectionist stance on trade recently, recently slapping tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports. Last week, the administration said it was looking into additional tariffs on $200 billion in goods from China. Click here to read Bloomberg's full report.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. Tesla CEO Elon Musk apologized after making the baseless claim that a British diver involved in the Thai cave rescue mission was a pedophile. The apology comes after the spelunker, Vern Unsworth, who was involved in the early days of efforts to save the now-rescued boys\u2019 soccer team, threatened legal action against the billionaire executive over the comment. Musk said on Twitter late Tuesday that he had made the claim out of \u201canger\u201d because Unsworth had criticized his idea to rescue the boys with a \u201cmini-submarine\u201d made out of a SpaceX rocket part. \u201cNonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe fault is mine and mine alone.\u201d Tweet Musk got involved in efforts to rescue the group of 12 boys and their soccer coach earlier this month \u2014 mere days before their rescue. The boys had gotten stuck in the flooded Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai after venturing through it with their coach. He and a team of engineers from SpaceX and The Boring Company brought over the vessel \u2014 a cylinder made out of the liquid oxygen transfer tube of a Falcon rocket \u2014 to Thailand, and met with government officials there about the possibility of using it to help. But Narongsak Osottanakorn, head of the command center during the rescue, did not welcome the idea, saying the sub was \u201ctechnologically sophisticated\u201d but \u201cnot practical\u201d with the rescue mission. Musk then hit out at reports referring to Osottanakorn as \u201crescue chief,\u201d noting that he was the former provincial governor of Chiang Rai and claiming he was not the \u201csubject matter expert.\u201d Osottanakorn stepped down from his role to join the initiative. 'PR stunt' Unsworth took a much harsher tone on Musk's submarine proposal, however. The British diver, 63, called the project a \"PR stunt\" and said the billionaire could \"stick his submarine where it hurts.\" Retaliating on Twitter, Musk promised in a now-deleted series on tweets to release video footage of the submarine sailing through one of the caves. He then made the claim that Unsworth was a pedophile \u2014 calling him \"pedo guy\" \u2014 without offering any evidence as to the validity of the remark. Asked whether he would mull legal action against the Tesla CEO over possible defamation, the cave explorer reportedly said: \"Yes, it's not finished.\" In Musk's apology on Tuesday, the executive appeared to take issue with Unsworth's comments denoting a sexual act involving the submarine. Investor backlash Earlier on Tuesday, venture capitalist Gene Munster called on Musk to apologize, saying that his behavior was \u201cfueling an unhelpful perception\u201d of the entrepreneur\u2019s leadership. Munster claimed to write on behalf of bullish Tesla investors. show chapters Loup Ventures founder writes strongly worded open letter to Musk 11:15 AM ET Tue, 24 July 2018 | 02:53 The comments followed a rout in Tesla\u2019s share price on Monday, as traders digested the negative publicity surrounding Musk. Shares of Tesla barely moved in after hours trade on Tuesday, down about a tenth of a percent. Traders are concerned about the automaker's production capabilities and profitability.

CNBC looked at the average 12-month stock price forecast for each FANG member and calculated the return to that target for each stock. Taking the average of those expected returns, Wall Street expects the group will appreciate just 5.4 percent in price over the next 12 months, a far cry from the average return of 64.5 percent from the group the previous 12 months. It's also a much more bearish outlook than typical from the Wall Street analyst crowd. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); The average Wall Street analyst believes that, over the next year, Netflix shares will return just 2 percent, Amazon shares will return 4.7 percent, Alphabet shares will return 6.1 percent and Facebook shares will return 8.8 percent. The group has widely been hailed as leaders in the broader stock market over the past year, with consistently high advertising revenue as well as subscriber and user growth pushing shares of the tech-heavy group to all-time highs. Facebook and Amazon, which both notched new intraday highs on Monday, are up 29.8 percent and 80 percent, respectively, over the last year; Netflix, the leader of the group, is still up 125 percent over 12 months. Amazon, Netflix and Microsoft, meanwhile, are responsible for roughly 70 percent of S&P 500 returns and for 78 percent of Nasdaq 100 returns. The latest analysis comes just days after some Wall Street analysts, including J.P. Morgan Chase's Doug Anmuth, cautioned investors that the acceleration in the price of Netflix shares meant that the stock was likely closing in on a fair value. At the time, shares of Netflix had already exceeded the analyst's 12-month price target. Following Anmuth's note, the internet television and film streaming platform reported financial results on Monday that disappointed investors with softer subscriber growth both within the U.S. and overseas. Shares of Netflix fell 12.3 percent Tuesday, on track for their worst day in nearly two years. Commenting on his newly reduced Netflix price target, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said that \"despite continuing to like the story, we just don't see much upside over the next 12 months at this valuation level.\" The analyst cut his rating on Netflix shares to hold from buy while paring his target price to $350 from $360.

The trade war with the U.S. couldn\u2019t have come at a worse timing for China, which had just begun focusing \"in earnest\" on fixing problems with its economy, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Wednesday. Many analysts have suggested that the impact of the Washington-Beijing trade skirmish will be relatively muted on the Chinese economy, noting that exports to the U.S. do not hold a commanding presence in China's economic portfolio. But that line of thinking does not take into account how tariffs will affect business sentiment, investment and growth in China, the J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note. Those indirect effects could lead to \u201clarge\u201d collateral damage, they said. On July 6, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration officially instituted 25 percent duties on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. China, for its part, responded by implementing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. shortly afterward. The following week, the U.S. released a list of Chinese goods with an annual trade value of about $200 billion that may be subjected to 10 percent tariffs. \u201cAll this puts China in a very difficult position. Not only because much of the tariff and non-tariff measures are directed towards it, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse,\u201d the note said. \u201cAfter years of handwringing and navel gazing, China finally began to focus in earnest on curbing credit growth \u2014 its Achilles\u2019s heel \u2014 from around mid-2017.\u201d China\u2019s banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan ($1.88 trillion) in loans in 2016 as the government encouraged credit-fueled stimulus to meet its economic growth target. The credit explosion stoked worries about financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt, which authorities in 2017 pledged to contain. Both China's monetary and fiscal policies have been kept on a tight leash so far this year, and deleveraging \u2014 the process of reducing debt \u2014 has been hastened through tighter regulations, the analysts noted. However, this stance has run into headwinds in recent months, the analysts said. \u201cThe rise in US-China trade tensions have raised concerns about the strength of external and domestic demand in (the second half of 2018) via direct and indirect effects on services such as logistics, wholesale trade, and trade finance, as well as on business sentiment and investment,\u201d the analysts wrote. With business demand being potentially hit, the right way for China to respond to the trade war is for it to ease its monetary policy or to enact fiscal measures, they suggested. \u201cUnder the circumstances, easing monetary conditions to support demand and allowing the currency to absorb the shock of the trade war are the right policy choices.\u201d The depreciation of the yuan would offset the loss in export competitiveness for Chinese exporters due to higher tariffs, meaning that Chinese goods will essentially be cheaper to Americans. However, the analysts warned that easing monetary policy too aggressively could also \u201craise doubts about the commitment of the authorities\" to reduce debt. China's dilemma: Beijing is seeking to implement relatively tight monetary policy to force financial deleveraging, but it also needs easier monetary conditions to support growth. \u201cOver the last 15 years, whenever credit growth has risen more than warranted it has fueled concerns over financial stability and that has seeped into depreciation pressures on the currency,\u201d the note said. \u201cConsequently, the current monetary policy stance will need to be carefully balanced.\u201d Given the limits to using monetary policy, fiscal measures to support exporters or boost domestic demand could also be used, the note suggested. That could include increasing tax rebates \u2014 known as the value-added tax credit rate \u2014 to exporters in China which would raise their income by between 3.5 percent and 4 percent. \u201cRelying more on fiscal policy to support domestic demand and defray the costs of the trade war is the wiser choice ... Lessening the burden on monetary policy will also lighten the pressures on the currency,\u201d the analysts said. They added, however, that the government could be held back by fears that easing caps on government spending could again build up debt. \u2014 Reuters and CNBC's Huileng Tan contributed to this report.

Intel\u2019s market leadership in the semiconductor industry may be at risk, according to Evercore ISI. The firm lowered its rating to in line from outperform for Intel shares, saying the search for the company's next CEO will add to investor uncertainty. Last month Intel announced the resignation of its CEO Brian Krzanich for his alleged infraction of the company's nonfraternization policy stemming from a consensual relationship. Krzanich violated the policy that said managers cannot have relationships with people who report to them either directly or indirectly, Intel said. He was replaced on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan. \u201cThe departure of Brian Krzanich adds additional uncertainty, as it comes at a crucial time for the company. Intel is facing increasing competition from the likes of Nvidia and AMD, and its manufacturing advantages appear to be flagging, with TSMC\u2019s 7nm processes in production,\u201d analyst C.J. Muse said in a note to clients Monday. Intel shares traded down slightly Tuesday after the report. Its stock is up 13 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 5 percent return. Muse reduced his price target to $54 from $64 for Intel shares, representing 4 percent upside to Monday's close. The analyst also noted Intel\u2019s problems in moving to its next-generation chip manufacturing technology. The chipmaker revealed on its April 26 earnings conference call that it delayed volume production under its 10-nanometer chip manufacturing process to next year. Conversely, AMD said on its call that it plans to start next-generation 7-nanometer chip production in late 2018. One nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter. Smaller nanometer chipmaking technologies allow companies to create faster, more power-efficient chips. \u201cThe company\u2019s competitors are not standing still. AMD is in its best position in years, and the AI/compute landscape is changing dramatically with the rise of alternative architectures (NVDA, custom processors, etc.),\u201d he said. When asked for comment, an Intel spokesperson referred to their previous statement, saying \u201cwe remain confident in our products and competitive position.\u201d Intel is slated to report its second-quarter results on July 26.

According to economic forecaster Lakshman Achuthan, the trend between income and spending growth is signaling trouble is already here. \"These are two of the key coincident indicators of what defines the economic cycle,\" he said Monday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"What we see today is that real consumer spending growth has fallen to a four and quarter year low. That\u2019s even lower than the lowest point we saw at the end of the 2015 slowdown.\" The co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute is hyper-focused on it \u2014 calling it the single most important chart out there right now because it suggests inflation is already corroding spending power. \"Here\u2019s 70 percent of the U.S. economy which is slowing,\" he added. It's not the first time Achuthan has addressed the chart on \"Trading Nation.\" In late May, the former self-proclaimed super bull said the economy was \"cruising for a bruising.\" His latest data show the trend is deteriorating. \"It\u2019s actually happening \u2014 kind of a stealth slowdown,\" he said. \"I think it becomes more apparent in the next quarter or two. ... If it continues to slow, you have the window of vulnerability opening up where negative shocks that we can weather when the economy is growing becomes a lot more problematic in that kind of scenario.\" Achuthan's latest thoughts came the same day the government posted June retail sales numbers that suggested robust economic growth. But the data aren't swaying him in a more positive direction. \u201cRetail sales, the headline numbers that are making the rounds today [Monday], those are all nominal. So when you adjust for inflation, the shine comes off,\" Achuthan said, adding real consumer spending growth is broader than retail sales.

Powell is delivering his semiannual testimony to Congress this week, starting with an appearance Tuesday before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. In remarks he provided ahead of a question-and-answer session, Powell painted a largely positive picture of the economy, which he said is expanding at an increasing pace and is being boosted by aggressive fiscal policy on Capitol Hill. \"Overall, we see the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening as roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than we currently anticipate,\" Powell said. \"The unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further. Americans who want jobs have a good chance of finding them,\" he added. Powell spoke as the central bank is in the process of gradually raising interest rates. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee has hiked the Fed's benchmark rate twice this year in quarter-point increments, and is expected to approve two more increases before the end of the year. show chapters Fed's Powell: Important to get housing finance off governmental balance sheet 11:28 AM ET Tue, 17 July 2018 | 03:40 Though the economy grew at just a 2 percent pace in the first quarter, Powell said growth in the second quarter was \"considerably stronger than the first.\" \"Robust job gains, rising after-tax incomes, and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months. Investment by businesses has continued to grow at a healthy rate,\" he said. \"Good economic performance in other countries has supported U.S. exports and manufacturing. And while housing construction has not increased this year, it is up noticeably from where it stood a few years ago.\" Inflation is running around the Fed's 2 percent target for the first time in several years, while the unemployment rate is at 4 percent and consistent with a level that most economists consider near to full employment. Powell said wages are growing faster than a year ago but not enough to stoke inflation fears. Powell made brief mention of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its global competitors, saying only that it is \"difficult to predict\" what the ramifications will be on the economy. However, the \"upbeat tone\" from the testimony likely means the trade issues won't keep the Fed from hiking rates, said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

On Tuesday, Mastercard won a patent to protect a method that would manage \"fractional reserves of blockchain currency.\" At present, Mastercard holders can only pay for things using currency that the government has declared as legal tender, Seth Eisen, Mastercard's senior vice president for communications, said. In the document, published with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Mastercard said that there has been \"increased usage\" in blockchain currencies by consumers who \"value anonymity and security.\" But there are disadvantages to using digital currency, the document noted, and there's a need to improve the storage and processing capability of such transactions. \"While blockchain currencies can often provide such safety and security for the payer's information, such security may be limited for payees, particularly due to the limitations of the blockchain,\" the document said. For example, digital coin transactions still take longer: about 10 minutes for blockchain transactions versus nanoseconds for traditional payments. As a result, both consumers and merchants have to wait a \"significant amount of time\" for these digital transactions to go through, or \"rely on the payer's good faith\" that they are valid, said the document. It added that in the latter instances, the anonymity of the blockchain may leave those accepting payments at a disadvantage. \"Many entities, particularly merchants, retailers, service providers, and other purveyors of goods and services, may be wary of accepting blockchain currency for products and participating in blockchain transactions,\" the document concluded. However, while the details are still unclear, if the method was brought to market, it could speed up blockchain transactions by allowing cardholders to instantly pay for things on their credit card with a fraction of their digital currency. In an email to CNBC, Eisen wrote, \"We\u2019re consistently looking at ways to bring new thinking and new innovations to market to create value for us and our customers and cardholders. Patent applications are part of that process, taking steps to protect the company\u2019s intellectual property, whether or not the idea ever comes to market.\" Eisen said currently, no products have been brought to market. Still, Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee told CNBC that this is good news for digital currency. \"It\u2019s really validating the idea that digital money, or blockchain-based money, is a valid form of transaction,\" Lee, who serves as managing partner and head of research at the equity research firm, said on \"Fast Money\" Tuesday. The bitcoin bull pointed out that other countries, such as Japan, have \"taken a much more positive view on digital money, or blockchain based money, being real transactions.\" Crypto traders celebrated Tuesday as bitcoin passed $7,000 around 2 p.m. ET and held steady above $7,300 for most of the day, according to Coinbase. That's an increase of about 13 percent from a month ago. Bitcoin fell below $6,000 in June, in what some traders deemed was a cryptocurrency bear market. The coin bounced back a few days later. Still, bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap \u2014 valued at more than $125 billion, according to CoinMarketCap \u2014 is nowhere near its December peak when it was priced around $19,500.

Here are the leading candidates: John Waldron, 49: Waldron, a star dealmaker who came from Bear Stearns like Solomon, has been given a series of high-profile roles within the investment bank, culminating with his being named co-head of the advisory division in 2014. He joined Goldman in 2000 and has been co-head of the media and entertainment group and a practice catering to private equity firms. Source: Goldman Sachs Marty Chavez, 54: Chavez, who is currently chief financial officer, has had a varied career. He co-founded a pair of technology start-ups and had trading roles at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse before returning to the New York-based bank in 2005. He served as chief information officer for three years until 2017, when he became CFO. Amanda Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Martin Chavez, Goldman Sachs Stephen Scherr, 54: Scherr, who heads the consumer and commercial banking division, has oversight of the firm's push into online retail banking products under the Marcus brand. He joined Goldman in 1993 as an associate in the investment bank, eventually rising to be global head of the firm's financing group in 2008. He served as chief strategy officer from 2014 to 2017.

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivers his semiannual testimony to Congress this week, with an appearance Tuesday in the Senate and Wednesday in the House of Representatives. Among the topics he likely will address: The central bank's plans to continue raising interest rates, his views on the global trade war and how it might affect monetary policy, and the Fed's general outlook on inflation and the economy. He also could be questioned about the progress the Fed has made in unwinding its balance sheet, a $4.3 trillion portfolio of bonds the bank accumulated during its efforts to stimulate the economy. However, he is not expected to provide a specific timetable about when the Fed will halt the reduction of the balance sheet, a process that began in October by allowing a set level of proceeds to run off each month.

Katzke's price forecast represents 20 percent upside over the next year. The daytime upgrade came just a few hours after Goldman Sachs reported that the bank's profit surged 40 percent to $2.57 billion in the second quarter, surpassing Street revenue expectations in every major business with the exception of trading. The company's earnings of $5.98 per share also beat the $4.66 also topped projections. However, the shares fell on a disappointing rise in litigation and regulatory costs.

capital fund. His wife, an elementary school teacher in their home village, was \u201cterrified\u201d that he got to manage so much money, Mr. Wang said. Things are different this year. After three months and visits with more than 90 potential investors all over China, Mr. Wang and his partners raised only $3 million for a second fund. In June they shut down the firm. Their fund, East Zhang Hangzhou Investment Management Ltd., was 1 of nearly 10,000 founded over the past three years amid a technology gold rush powered in part by China\u2019s government-guided economic growth engine. Now they have become the latest sign that China\u2019s engine is slowing down. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Bloomberg | Getty Images Many Chinese still believe their central government has the capacity to keep the economy from sliding into a recession, just as it did during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Great Recession in 2008. \u201cAll industries, institutions and individuals are running short of cash,\u201d said Zhang Kaixing, founder and chief executive of an online asset management company in Shenzhen called Jinfuzi, which means \u201cgolden ax.\u201d Jinfuzi, which manages over $4.5 billion in assets, is the type of investor that technology funds court. \u201cMany investors in private equity and venture capital funds want to take their money back,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. Venture capital is a small part of the Chinese economy, which by most accounts is still growing at a quick pace compared with that of many other countries. But the industry\u2019s fundraising problems may be a symptom of a widening malaise. After many years of easy credit and go-go growth, China is struggling with weakened investment and household consumption and increasing corporate and local government defaults. It could present Xi Jinping with his most difficult problem since he became the country\u2019s top leader in 2013. Will China\u2019s 40 years of continuous economic expansion stop under his rule? If so, how will 1.4 billion Chinese react when they realize that the country\u2019s upward trajectory is coming to an end? More from The New York Times: Why Made in China 2025 Will Succeed, Despite Trump ZTE's Near-Collapse May Be China's Sputnik Moment China's Strong Economic Growth Figures Belie Signs of Weakness Many Chinese still believe that the central government has the capacity to keep the economy from sliding into a recession, just as it did during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Great Recession in 2008. Beijing controls the banks, land, foreign exchange rates and the media, so it can mobilize and manipulate them when necessary. \u201cIn China we believe in Keynesian economics,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, the Jinfuzi chief executive, referring to the economic theory that favors a bigger role for government. \u201cIf what\u2019s going on in China were happening in the U.S., it would have been called a recession. But in China, the government will step in to interfere in significant ways.\u201d Under President Xi, even economics has become a delicate topic. Many people in China are not willing to speak publicly because even economists aren\u2019t allowed to make downward forecasts. Getty Images China's weakened investment and increasing corporate and local government defaults may be President Xi Jinping's most difficult issue since he became the country\u2019s top leader in 2013. Yet in private conversations, investors, entrepreneurs and economists admit that with the high debt level and a trade war with the United States, the room for government maneuvering is shrinking. The degrees of pessimism vary, but many of them are bracing for a tough ride ahead. They told me to change all my savings into gold, a risk-management measure for extreme times. They worry that the trade war will hurt the tech and the venture capital industries because they operate globally. They even envision the possibility of the world\u2019s going back to the Iron Curtain era, the pre-1989 world order of distinct political, economic and ideological barriers between the Soviet bloc and the West. Wu Xiaoling, a former deputy central bank governor and now dean of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance, told the graduates last week to brace for global economic and political uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time left to revel in the carnival of bubbles,\u201d she said in a speech. \u201cEvery country, every individual should be prepared to face the reality after the tide retreats.\u201d The speech was circulated widely on the Chinese social media, possibly because she said what\u2019s on many people\u2019s minds. China\u2019s venture capital industry may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. It is sensitive to both money flows and capital sentiment, and therefore could offer a good gauge of the health of key parts of the Chinese economy. The Chinese government on Monday reported that the economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year ago. \"All industries, institutions and individuals are running short of cash. Many investors in private equity and venture capital funds want to take their money back.\" -Zhang Kaixing, founder and CEO of Jinfuzi, an online asset management company in Shenzhen So far, funding this year is weak. In the first three months, private equity and venture capital funds raised less than two-thirds of what they had raised over the same period a year ago, according to Zero2IPO Research in Beijing. Their investing activity dropped by nearly half. Funding has slowed in the past when the economy hit bumps, but both the data and the people involved say the current slowdown is unprecedented. Venture funds like East Zhang came into existence in part because, starting in 2014, Beijing made innovation and entrepreneurship top priorities. Leaders hoped that start-ups would help elevate China from a manufacturing power to a technology power. Corporations, banks and wealthy individuals fought to give money to venture funds to invest in start-ups. \u201cWe ended up with a lot of dumb money, managed by inexperienced investors,\u201d said Ran Wang, chief executive of the investment bank CEC Capital Group in Beijing. Wang Shidong of East Zhang said his firm raised funds in 2016 without having to answer tough questions. They decided to set it up in the eastern city of Hangzhou, which \u2014 to attract funds like Mr. Wang\u2019s \u2014 provides streamlined business registration, tax cuts and below-market office rents, as many other Chinese cities do. They invested in 17 projects in e-commerce, internet, biotech and agriculture. Only one of them is doing well. The rest either have failed or are barely surviving, Mr. Zhang said. The funding climate changed completely this year, he said. \u201cInvestors started paying attention to our numbers.\u201d It\u2019s not just newbie firms like East Zhang that are having a hard time finding investors. Funding is getting hard to come by for almost every venture capital firm. Under pressure from the government to improve their finances, banks pulled away from risky investments. This year\u2019s ailing Chinese stock market has cost companies and wealthy investors alike a great deal of money. The government has cracked down on the risky and informal sources of money within China that provided a lot of venture capital funding. Greg Baker | AFP | Getty Images An investor watches stock price movements at a securities company in Beijing. Even venture capital firms with good track records are taking longer to reach their money-raising targets, said Ran Wang of CEC Capital. Some firms have to settle for smaller funds than planned, Mr. Wang said. There\u2019s another sign China\u2019s boom in start-ups may be over: They\u2019re going public. More than two dozen of China\u2019s star start-ups hope to sell shares on public stock markets this year. Generally, as in the United States, start-ups prefer not to go public as long as they have plenty of access to private money. China is home to more than 70 unicorns, or start-ups with valuations over $1 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s getting increasingly harder for companies with high valuations to raise funding from venture capital investors,\u201d said Mr. Wang of CEC Capital. As for Wang Shidong of East Zhang, he has sold his apartment and car to repay some of his investors and is getting ready to start anew. He is considering an offer from an acquaintance to work for an online payment venture in Nigeria. \u201cI\u2019m an adventurer,\u201d he said. \u2014 By Li Yuan.

Morgan Stanley crushed profit expectations on trading and investment banking results that exceeded analysts' expectations. The New York-based company said profit surged 39 percent to $2.44 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, exceeding the $2 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Earnings per share of $1.30 surpassed the $1.11 estimate. Revenues climbed 12 percent to $10.6 billion, about $500 million more than analysts expected. The shares were up 3.9 percent at 9:47 a.m. In the bank's equities division, the biggest on Wall Street, the company delivered $2.5 billion in revenue on good performance across all products, especially financing, compared with the $2.29 billion estimate. It's bond trading department produced $1.4 billion, compared with the $1.29 billion estimate, on higher results in commodities and credit. \"Morgan Stanley\u2019s performance in sales and trading was particularly impressive, especially compared to rival Goldman Sachs,\" Octavio Marenzi, head of capital markets management consultancy Opimas, said in an e-mail. On Tuesday, Goldman reported trading results that essentially matched expectations, prompting questions from analysts on why it didn't outperform like its rivals, including J.P. Morgan Chase. Investment banking, which includes deal advisory and stock and bond issuance, generated $1.7 billion in revenue, compared with the $1.54 billion estimate. The business exceeded expectations across dealmaking and capital markets units, the bank said. \u201cWe reported robust revenue and earnings growth this quarter with strength across all businesses and geographies,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in a statement. \u201cOur strong global franchise positions us well to continue to grow organically across each of our businesses and to deliver operating leverage.\u201d Still, revenues in wealth management and investment management were slightly below expectations. Wealth management produced $4.3 billion in revenue, compared with the $4.43 billion estimate, as the company said transactional revenues declined by almost 10 percent thanks to lower fixed income results. Investment management, the smallest of the company's three main divisions, generated $691 million in revenue, below the $707.9 million estimate. Under Gorman, 59, Morgan Stanley has emphasized its wealth management division, a far steadier business than trading operations. He has also overhauled its fixed income business, moves that helped the company eclipse rival Goldman Sachs in market capitalization earlier this year. The executive behind that bond trading rebound, Ted Pick, was promoted this month to gain oversight of investment banking activities. The company was forced last month to keep its capital return plans unchanged from last year after fumbling a key part of its annual stress test. Morgan Stanley said Wednesday that, as expected, it raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 25 cents and authorized a $4.7 billion share buyback program, which is consistent with its 2017 plan. Morgan Stanley shares were down 6.2 percent this year before Wednesday, underperforming the KBW Bank Index, which is almost unchanged.

According to economist and Yale University senior fellow Stephen Roach, the markets are underestimating the impact from the trade war with China. \"The market just thinks this is typical Donald Trump bluster, and based on his performance on a lot of other issues,\" he said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"But we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019ve initiated tariffs.\" In March, the U.S. struck first by imposing global levies on steel and aluminum imports. China retaliated by placing tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. imports. By July, President Trump was taking additional steps to institute hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on additional Chinese products. \"The U.S., I think, will definitely feel the impact of these tariffs it\u2019s placing on China. Consumers will be hurt as supply chain shift the higher cost to producers,\" Roach said. \"We certainly have strong growth in the quarter that ended. But I would be reluctant to extrapolate that in the future, and our markets are not prepared.\" Roach, who was Morgan Stanley Asia chairman for five years and is considered a leading authority on China, believes the U.S. will be unable to avoid damage. \"The idea that we\u2019re in a position of strength is very myopic, very backward looking and misses the fundamental headwinds that loom out there,\" he noted. Even if Trump dials back his tariff policy, Roach contended businesses are already getting hurt from the uncertainty stemming from the trade issue. \"If we are waiting for [Chinese President] Xi Jinping, to capitulate, then the situation is going to go from bad to worse,\" Roach said. But Peter Navarro, director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, told CNBC on Thursday that the trade tensions could have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. \"This is a trade dispute.

TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon is betting on a bigger rally for the stock when it reports earnings next week. Gordon told CNBC\u2019s \u201cTrading Nation\u201d on Tuesday that \u201cthere\u2019s not much to dislike\u201d about the chart of the credit card giant, referring specifically to what he describes as a \u201cbeautiful uptrend\u201d for Visa that has been in place since February. A shorter-term chart of Visa leads Gordon to believe that the stock is currently settling into a fourth Elliott wave, leading him to predict that there will be a fifth and final wave that pushes Visa to $145. At the same time, he also identifies that support is at around $137 given the stock\u2019s current consolidation. As a result, Gordon wants to sell the July 27 weekly 139-strike put and buy the July 27 weekly 137-strike put for a credit of 79 cents, or $79 total credit. This means that if Visa closes above $139 on July 27 expiration, then Gordon would make the $79 credit on the trade. However, if Visa were to close below $137 on the expiration date, then Gordon could lose $121. But the stock was already trading at just over $139 on Tuesday, meaning Visa just needs to hold above its current level when the market closes on July 27. The trade: Gordon is suggesting selling the July 27 weekly 137/139 put spread in V for about $79 credit. Bottom line: Gordon sees V rallying above $139 on July 27 expiration.

Canadian medical marijuana company Tilray made its debut on the Nasdaq on Thursday \u2014 becoming the first pure-play marijuana company to go public on a major U.S. exchange. And Tilray President and CEO Brendan Kennedy told CNBC that the buzz around cannabis is only going to continue to grow. \"Eight years ago you would have seen 90 percent of the revenues in Colorado would have come from products that would be smoked,\" Kennedy said Thursday on \"Power Lunch.\" \"Today it\u2019s about 40 percent. Long term, I think we\u2019ll end up with smoking being about 10 percent [of cannabis consumption] and all the other products being 90 percent.\" In fact, Kennedy envisions a world where consumers can order their cannabis \"as a beverage in a bar.\" \"Instead of alcohol, they\u2019ll have cannabis,\" said Kennedy, who is also a member of Tilray's board of directors. \"And they\u2019ll have a low, or no-calorie product with no hangover.\" Tilray offered 9 million shares of its Class 2 common stock, which kicked off trading Thursday morning at $23.05 per share under the symbol \"TLRY.\" The company said in an SEC filing in advance of the offering that it was looking to sell stock between $14 and $16 per share, which valued Tilray between about $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. The IPO priced at $17 a share late Wednesday. Tilray cultivates, processes and distributes cannabis products to tens of thousands of medical marijuana patients across 10 countries, including Australia, Canada and Germany, through subsidiaries and agreements with pharmaceutical distributors. The company currently grows marijuana in both Canada and Portugal. Currently, products are available in 10 countries on five continents. And Kennedy said his company's customer base will only increase as \"country after country around the world\" seeks to legalize medical cannabis. He said the \"shift away from an illicit market to legal market\" would increase adult cannabis users globally from 3.5 million to about 40 million people, with other countries modeling Canada's regulatory framework. \"What you\u2019re starting to see in adult-use countries like Canada, is people will buy professionally branded, professionally packaged, tested products that are much safer than what\u2019s available on the illicit market,\" Kennedy said. Tilray's move from public to private follows in the footsteps of Canadian marijuana giants Cronos Group and Canopy Growth. Cronos, a $1.1 billion company with medical marijuana growing and distribution operations in Australia, Canada, Germany and Israel, was the first pure-play, \"plant touching\" company to trade on a major U.S. exchange when it listed on the Nasdaq in February. Canopy, Canada's biggest marijuana company, followed soon after, listing on the New York Stock Exchange in May. Both traded on exchanges in Canada before their U.S. listings. Tilray Brendan Kennedy, CEO of Tilray, poses for a portrait. Tilray's IPO may come on the heels of the U.S. listings of Cronos and Canopy, but Beacon Securities analyst David Kideckel said he doesn't think there will be a mad dash among Canadian companies to follow suit. The majority of Canadian cannabis companies \"are public already on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange. It is possible they will apply for a dual listing, but the number of Canadian companies going to a direct listing it is hard to say,\" Kideckel said. \"The number of private companies are limited.\" American companies, however, still struggle to gain the financial benefits and credibility that come with going public on a major U.S. exchange. Stock exchanges have stringent requirements for companies looking to list, including restrictions on those that have broken federal law. That means companies based in countries where marijuana is legalized like Canada may meet listing requirements in America, while their U.S.-based counterparts cannot. U.S. marijuana companies are allowed to list on Canadian exchanges, so long as they fully disclose all risks to investors. But Canada's largest exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, has forbidden it. The world's ninth-largest exchange announced in October that U.S. cannabis companies cannot meet listing requirements because they violate federal law in their home countries.

The stock fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Earnings: $1.84 per share vs. $1.82 per share, forecast by Thomson ReutersRevenue: $10.00 billion vs. $10.05 billion, forecast by Thomson Reuters For the second quarter, AmEx's net income climbed to $1.62 billion, or $1.84 per share, from $1.34 billion, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. The company said its results benefited from \"higher spending by consumer, small business, and corporate Card Members.\" AmEx said it also saw higher loan volumes and fee income. The payments company reaffirmed its full-year profit outlook, saying it still expects earnings between $6.90 and $7.30 a share. American Express said its provisions for losses were $806 million, up 38 percent from $583 million a year ago. The company said the figure was in line with its expectations. It also said that \"growth in the loan and charge portfolios and higher write-off rates\" contributed to that increase. AmEx also said its expenses climbed 7 percent to $7.1 billion amid \"higher rewards expenses and costs associated with marketing and business development.\" It said, however, that operating expenses declined 2 percent year over year. In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of American Express in a credit card fee lawsuit. AmEx rules stopped merchants from offering customers discounts or incentives to use cards with lower \"swipe\" fees, like rivals Visa or Mastercard. As of the market close, shares of American Express have climbed 20 percent in the past 12 months. The stock remains close to its all-time intraday high of $103.24, ending Wednesday's session at $102.98.

The European Union is making a list of goods it could target as a way to retaliate against potential tariffs on European cars, an EU official said Thursday. \"If the U.S. would impose these car tariffs, that would be very unfortunate. We are preparing together with our member states a list of rebalancing measures there as well. And we have made that clear to our American partners,\" Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said at a conference in Brussels. \"It is done in the same way as with steel and aluminum,\" she also said. Malmstrom\u2019s comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on European car imports to 20 percent from 2.5 percent last month. They also come ahead of a meeting between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington. The two are scheduled to meet next week and discuss trade between the U.S. and Europe. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported that Juncker will likely convey to Trump the EU's willingness to lower auto tariffs between the two sides and other major car-exporting countries. Tensions on the trade front between the U.S. and Europe have risen lately. The U.S. has slapped charges on steel and aluminum imports coming from Europe, while the EU has retaliated with tariffs on $3.25 billion worth of U.S. exports, including bourbon and motorcycles.

Fed Governor Randal Quarles, vice chairman for supervision, said banks can use the central bank's Secured Overnight Financing Rate as an alternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, a benchmark that has come under scrutiny due to multiple issues of fraud. \"It is important that we find ways to make it as easy as possible to use SOFR because the risks to Libor are, at this stage, quite considerable,\" Quarles said in a speech to the Alternative Reference Rates Committee Roundtable. In furtherance of providing a Libor alternative, Quarles said the Fed could publish an SOFR average that banks could use. He said some have suggested calling the average the secured average financing rate, or SAFR, an apparent indication that the new indicator is more secure than Libor. Along with the fraud issues, there have been concerns about the low level of trading that underpins Libor, raising liquidity questions that SOFR does not have. SOFR indicates the cost of borrowing overnight by using trading data across financial marketplaces. Quarles said the Libor market has become \"extraordinarily thin.\" \"On most days, the banks that submit to Libor have been forced to rely on their own judgement and models in submitting to Libor rather than actual transactions. Many of them have become justifiably uncomfortable with a system that pins hundreds of trillions of dollars' worth of financial contracts to that type of judgement call,\" he said. The current SOFR is 1.9 percent, while Libor is at 1.91 percent.

One major driver for this possible occurrence: ethereum. \"Right now ethereum has an enormous amount of developer activity,\" Allaire said. \"One of the things that really catalyzed the [cryptocurrency] market last year was actually that ethereum, in particular, kind of got to a place where you could build apps on top of it,\" he said. \"You could issue new tokens on top of it; you could create new kinds of financial contracts, using the smart contracts technology.\" Ethereum is the name of the platform that created the digital token ether. The company created a platform for applications built on blockchain, the same technology that underpins bitcoin. Ether was first launched as a fundraising effort to develop the platform. As a result, Allaire concluded, ICOs, or initial coin offerings \u2014 a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures \u2014 have dramatically increased.

Some to consider are EOS, NEO and Cardano, he said. Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto via Getty Images Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value. Meanwhile, crypto traders rejoiced this week as bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap, moved above $7,000 Tuesday, after falling below $6,000 last month. While the increase is significant, it's still far below the December 2017 highs of around $19,500. But bitcoin bulls say the coin is not dead yet. \"When the chair of the Fed says negative thing about bitcoin, and Howard Marks says negative things about bitcoin, and Ken Griffin says negative things about bitcoin, and bitcoin doesn\u2019t move, I think that\u2019s a really bullish sign,\" Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of financial firm Digital Currency Group, said on \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. On Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. ET, bitcoin was priced just over $7,300, where it had held steady for more than 24 hours. Silbert predicts 2019 will be a good year for both blockchain and cryptocurrencies, with increased accessibility and better understanding of products. \"I'm all about the infrastructure that's required to create the on-ramps and the off-ramps for Wall Street to get involved in this asset class,\" Silbert said. \u2014 CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report.

Wells Fargo shares were lower by 0.3 percent in early trading Thursday. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking into the matter, the report said. Wells first disclosed issues with add-on products in its second-quarter regulatory filing last year. In its most recent filing in May it said practices related to consumer add-on products like identity theft and debt protection were the subject of a June 2015 consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator for national banks. Wells said it was reviewing the products and has begun remediation efforts. Getty Images CEO and President of Wells Fargo & Company Timothy Sloan The bank stopped selling add-on products in the middle of last year and is phasing out of existing consumer add-on products. In a statement emailed to CNBC, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said: \"We are reviewing add-on products sold to consumers by the Bank or its service providers and if issues are found during this review, we will make things right with customers in the form of refunds or remediation. We are working with our regulators on the ongoing review.\u201d Regulators are looking at whether customers were deceived, Dow Jones reported, and at their awareness of the products and ability to cancel them. Wells Fargo has spent nearly two years trying to clean up from a scandal that first erupted in 2016 over fake accounts opened in customers' names by employees trying to meet aggressive sales targets. Soon, sales practices in other areas of the bank fell under scrutiny, including in mortgages and auto lending. In April, the bank struck a $1 billion settlement with the CFPB and the OCC over its risk management failings.

Wells Fargo Securities' George Bory sees a bullish trend in corporate bond demand. \"With bond yields being somewhat more stable, we\u2019re actually starting to see an uptick in interest in our asset class. So, there is a little bit of a squeeze. There is money coming into the market. Now, that\u2019s the good news,\" Bory, the firm's head of credit strategy, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" But by September, there may be a chill in the air. \"The bad news is it\u2019s probably not going to last all that long. We think it\u2019s a summer phenomenon that we\u2019re in the midst of. It probably runs for another four, maybe six weeks,\" he added. Since the day after the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index, which tracks the performance of investment-grade corporate bonds, is up about 1 percent. Bory attributed part of that positive momentum to a pretty dramatic decrease in the issuance of U.S. government Treasurys over the past few weeks. But with another Federal Reserve rate hike likely on the way and the re-emergence of Treasury bond issuance, Bory predicts the bullish trend will break. \"Those patterns we saw in the first half of the year are likely to continue,\" Bory said. That's when the 10-Year Treasury Note yield rallied 19 percent, hitting a multiyear high of 3.12 percent on May 17. Inflation fears and rising interest rates provided the catalyst for rising yields. Yet, he's not bailing on the space. \u201cIn the world of fixed income, I think we\u2019re still in capital protection mode,\" he said. \"We very much favor the front end of curves. The shorter the duration, the better.\" Bory's top plays include investment-grade or high-yield corporate bonds. \"You can generate a 1, 2 or maybe even a 3 percent total return. To us, at least relative to other fixed income opportunities, that looks pretty attractive,\" Bory said. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Hong Kong, long a global leader in banking and finance, is bracing for the arrival of so-called virtual banks \u2014 financial institutions without physical branches where all transactions are online. Authorities are keen to raise Hong Kong\u2019s game in financial technology, or \"fintech,\" part of broader ambitions to turn the semi-autonomous Chinese territory into a \u201csmart city\u201d amid intensifying regional and global digital competition. Financial regulator Hong Kong Monetary Authority released revised guidelines for virtual banks at the end of May after consultations with stakeholders including the Hong Kong Association of Banks. The HKMA said more than 50 companies have expressed interest in the licenses. Firms face an end of August deadline for the first batch, which could be issued as early as this year. Locally based payments platform Yedpay and international bank Standard Chartered said they plan to apply for licenses, while online lending operator WeLab is reportedly among those hoping to obtain one. \u201cThe development of virtual banks will promote the application of financial technology and innovation in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience,\u201d the HKMA said. The arrival of new entrants into Hong Kong\u2019s highly developed banking ecosystem is being welcomed as a long-term positive that has already got the attention of financial giants, which, aside from Standard Chartered, also include names such as HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong). \u201cThey understand that these new entrants, the technology companies, they pose a threat to traditional banks,\u201d Sonny Hsu, vice president and senior credit officer in the Financial Institutions Group at Moody's Investors Service, told CNBC. \u201cThey have to adapt their offering, they have to offer better services to customers, more convenience, faster payment capabilities,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like the incumbents are just sitting still and are being complacent.\u201d \u2018Raising the bar\u2019 Indeed, established banks in Hong Kong are increasingly offering online banking services, part of a global trend as consumers embrace advantages such as convenience, transparency and lower transaction fees. Standard Chartered suggested that its name recognition would be a plus. \u201cPeople do not want another account with a different brand, they want their financial lives simplified,\u201d Samir Subberwal, regional head of retail banking for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered, said in a release announcing the company's intention to apply for a virtual bank license. show chapters 'AI and robotics will take over the financial world' 1:59 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:04 Virtual banks will be required to have a physical office in Hong Kong for dealing with the HKMA and customer questions or complaints, but they will not need to spend heavily on building and staffing branch networks. The advantage basically ends there, however, as virtual banks will largely face the same rules as traditional ones, including stringent capital requirements, leaving them little recourse but to either offer more attractive terms or much better digital experiences to attract consumers. \u201cThey\u2019ll be subject to the same regulations so they have to compete on an equal basis as the banks,\u201d said Hsu, stressing that the HKMA wants to increase competition while being careful to avoid planting the seeds for future banking instability. In other words, virtual banks will have little room to engage in so-called \u201cregulatory arbitrage,\u201d or taking advantage of loopholes in the rules to gain an edge over their bulkier competitors. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to compete on offering lower cost services than traditional banks,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cOtherwise, there\u2019ll be little incentive for the customers to switch to these new platforms.\u201d Consultancy KPMG said in a report in April that the introduction of virtual banks to Hong Kong will ultimately boost overall competitiveness. Technology developed by financial technology companies can lower costs and help consumers without credit history get loans they couldn\u2019t obtain from traditional banks, it said. \u201cThis could significantly boost financial inclusion and encourage traditional banks to further develop their own platforms, thereby raising the bar across the whole industry,\u201d KPMG said.

He added, however, that \"in the long, long run, cryptocurrencies and things of that nature could matter,\" adding that blockchain \u2014 bitcoin's underlying technology \u2014 could be something that \"may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.\" WATCH: Powell on bitcoin last November show chapters Bitcoin is still not big enough to destabilize an economy, Fed nominee Powell says 1:00 PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 | 01:32 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/09/07/105299930-1536324911570amazon.jpg?v=1536324932", "time": "2018-07-18T16:20:16-0400", "author": "Mike Segar | Reuters", "description": "Shares of Amazon ticked lower on Wednesday despite the e-commerce giant reporting its annual Prime Day  was its biggest sales event ever.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/amazon-shares-slightly-higher-as-investors-await-prime-day-results.html", "title": "Amazon shares slide despite record Prime Day results", "keywords": [{"term": "Mike Segar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Manhattan", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "New York City", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Prime Day", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "0.1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 100 million", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Coresight Research", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "at least $3.4 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "late Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than $1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tuesday morning", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the first ten hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "year-over-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the first ten hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Feedvisor", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the first 12 hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "89 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Piper Jaffray", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2,075", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "1,850", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "late Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "13 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Piper", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AWS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the coming 12 months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.91 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "five days", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Prime Day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kensho", "category": "ORG"}], "body": " Mike Segar | Reuters Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City. Shares of Amazon ticked lower on Wednesday despite the e-commerce giant reporting its annual Prime Day was its biggest sales event ever. The stock fell 0.1 percent after closing at a record high in the previous session. Amazon said more than 100 million products were sold during the event, adding it was the company's \"biggest in history.\" However, it was not initially clear how much that represents in actual revenue. Coresight Research had forecast Prime Day sales to hit at least $3.4 billion. Early indications of the event had been positive. Amazon said in a press release late Tuesday that small and medium-sized businesses had sold more than $1 billion in since Monday, when the event started. A company spokeswoman also told CNBC on Tuesday morning that \u201cPrime Day sales in the U.S. so far are bigger than ever \u2013 in fact, in the first ten hours Prime Day grew even faster, year-over-year, than the first ten hours last year.\" Feedvisor also said Prime Day sales in the first 12 hours of the event rose 89 percent compared to last year\u2019s sales event. Separately, Piper Jaffray raised its price target on Amazon to $2,075 from $1,850 late Tuesday. The new forecast represents a 13 percent gain from Tuesday's close. Piper cited strength in Amazon's AWS business, rather than the retail unit, as reason for the increased upside over the coming 12 months. Prime Day got off to a rough start, however, as a massive glitch redirected shoppers away from the deals to pictures of dogs. The sales event has historically been a positive catalyst for Amazon\u2019s stock. Amazon averages a return of 1.91 percent five days after Prime Day, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time period, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho.

Declaring failure on a huge telecommunications acquisition has become old hat for Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. Comcast on Thursday formally withdrew its bid for Fox to focus on buying smaller U.K. media company Sky, as CNBC first reported earlier this week. In 2004, Comcast made an unsolicited $54 billion to acquire Disney, the very company it's been dueling with to acquire the Fox assets. \"This is a combination that we believe would restore the Disney brand,\" Roberts said during a conference call at the time. \"There is no doubt that these two companies can achieve things together that they would not be able to do alone.\" Disney resisted, and about three months later, Comcast threw in the towel, refusing to \"bid against ourselves.\" Similar to Thursday's news, investors appreciated Comcast's discipline, sending shares higher when Comcast decided to stop bidding for Disney. Today, Disney's market capitalization is about $170 billion, more than triple Comcast's bid at the time. Then in 2014, Comcast reached a $45 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable. But when regulators started to question Comcast's broadband power and adherence to behavioral conditions from its prior NBC Universal deal, Comcast dropped its attempt at buying the company. Time Warner Cable reached a deal with smaller cable peer Charter soon after Comcast walked away for $55 billion. Charter today is an $80 billion company. To be sure, Roberts has successfully acquired a number of huge companies as well \u2014 NBC in a two-part deal from General Electric, MediaOne for $60 billion in 1999 and AT&T Broadband for $72 billion in 2001. Comcast's decision that it won't top Disney's most recent cash-and-stock offer for Disney, valued at more than $71 billion on June 20, doesn't stop the acquisition train for Roberts quite yet. Comcast will continue its bidding war against Fox (working in tandem with Disney) for Sky. Comcast currently has the highest offer for Sky at \u00a314.75 ($19.20) per share, valuing the 61 percent of Sky that trades publicly at $34 billion. Fox-Disney hasn't yet signaled if it will let Roberts take Sky or will fight back with yet another higher offer. That means Roberts still has a chance to come away victorious on a deal \u2014 and also has a chance at a rare strike four.

Bitmex CEO isn\u2019t convinced 6:06 PM ET Thu, 19 July 2018 | 04:43 Bitcoin is rallying. The digital tokens were priced around $7,400 on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. ET \u2014 an increase of more than 10 percent from a month ago, according to Coinbase. But Arthur Hayes, the bitcoin bull who predicted the cryptocurrency would reach $50,000 by year's end just a few weeks ago, said bitcoin hasn't bottomed yet. \"I don't actually think we've seen the worst,\" Hayes, co-founder and co-CEO of Bitmex, said Thursday on \"Fast Money.\" His firm, BitMEX, or Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, is the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume. Hayes told CNBC that the coin could hit \"8,000, 9,000 and maybe just shy of 10,000,\" before falling again. \"I would like to see us test 5,000 to really see if we put a bottom in,\" Hayes said. Bitcoin's rally was good news for digital coin traders who watched the largest cryptocurrency by market cap fall below $6,000 last month. The coin recovered a few days later but is still significantly lower than bitcoin's all-time high of around $19,500 last December. Chesnot | Getty Images Still, Hayes stands firm on his earlier bitcoin predictions. In an email to CNBC, Hayes confirmed, \"I think the current rally will top out close to but not greater than $10,000. Then we will fall and test $5,000. If that holds then we can rally to $50,000 by year end.\" And, he said, market watchers should expect more volatility in the digital currency space. That's because, during the summer months, investors are \"taking a little bit of a chill time,\" he said. \"But come back in Q3, Q4, I think is when the party is going to start again,\" Hayes said.

Nygren said Thursday he thinks investors could be missing out on two big value plays if they just look at their price-to-earnings multiples, which are widely followed measures of stock valuations. \u201cYou hear people talk about excessive valuations on the FANG stocks. We\u2019re value managers and we own Facebook. Facebook, on next year\u2019s earnings estimates, is barely at a market multiple,\u201d Oakmark\u2019s Nygren told CNBC\u2019s \u201cHalftime Report.\u201d \u201cWe (also) own Netflix. Netflix is adding 20 million subscribers this year that we believe are worth $1,000 per subscriber,\u201d Nygren added. \u201cIf you think about the market cap relative to the value that they\u2019re adding, it\u2019s about 11 times. So to us, the argument of it being 200 times earnings or some silly number like that just shows how bad the accounting is; it doesn\u2019t show that the stock\u2019s overvalued.\u201d Netflix is one of the best-performing stocks this year, having risen 91 percent in 2018. Facebook, meanwhile, is up nearly 20 percent year to date. Both stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 for the year, which is up 5.1 percent. Chesnot | Getty Images Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks to participants during the Viva Technologie show at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on May 24, 2018 in Paris, France. However, their valuations have raised concern that they may be too expensive. Facebook\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings ratio was around 34.5 on Thursday, while Netflix\u2019s was near 170. Meanwhile, the S&P 500\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just under 22. Nygren joined Harris Associates, the investment advisor for Oakmark Funds, in 1983. He manages the firm's Oakmark Investor Fund, which has $21.1 billion in assets. His fund has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years and since inception through June. The portfolio manager also said he bought shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hilton Worldwide and Gartner to his portfolio during the second quarter. Nygren said Bristol is \u201can attractive long-term hold\u201d given its strong pipeline of products and heavy investments in its oncology franchise. He also said Hilton is \u201cnow almost entirely a royalty stream of income that grows with the amount of stays at their hotels.\u201d He also said Gartner actually has an attractive valuation despite sporting a price-to-earnings ratio above 30. \u201cThat\u2019s just a case of GAAP accounting not doing a good job of handling expenses that have very long-term benefits yet get expensed

Tesla shares will fall dramatically the rest of this year due to its high valuation and rising competition, according to J.P. Morgan. The firm reaffirmed its underweight rating on Tesla shares, saying other automakers may price their electric cars aggressively. Tesla has a \"highly differentiated business model, appealing product portfolio, and leading-edge technology, which we believe are more than offset by above-average execution risk and valuation that seems to be pricing in a lot,\" analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note to clients Friday. \"We have highlighted more concerns regarding increased competition, including from automakers looking to use the sale of battery electric vehicles to subsidize their more lucrative internal combustion engine portfolio vehicles from a legal, regulatory, and compliance perspective, rather than trying to generate profit on the sale of these battery electric vehicles in and of themselves.\" show chapters Tesla CEO Elon Musk versus the media: The top five moments 12:35 PM ET Thu, 19 July 2018 | 03:51 Tesla's stock fell 2.1 percent Friday.

Brinkman reaffirmed his $180 December 2018 price target for Tesla shares, representing 44 percent downside from Thursday's close. The analyst is cautious on the company\u2019s second-quarter financial numbers. It is slated to report its June quarter earnings results on Aug. 1, according to its website. Tesla said on July 2 that it reached its one-week production goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars during the last week of the June quarter. \u201cWe continue to be concerned that free cash flow has the potential to be a larger outflow, given the fact that the much heralded production rate improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, we worry about margin, given the potential for overtime, premium freight, and other expenses employed to ramp production in a seemingly inefficient manner.\u201d Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bank has since been renamed to Al Rayan bank. Higher oil prices this year have reduced the need for energy-exporters in the Middle East to raise funds through the Islamic bond market \u2014 threatening the growth of a niche finance sector that has been struggling to gain wider traction. Oil prices have stayed above $60 per barrel so far this year. That's expected to persist: S&P Global Ratings has revised upward its forecast for oil to an average $65 per barrel this year from the $55 per barrel it projected earlier. As the key commodity inched higher in its price, global issuance of Islamic bonds fell 15.3 percent year-over-year to $44.2 billion in the first six months of this year, according to S&P. The agency said it expects 2018 to end with $70 billion to $80 billion in total volume \u2014 coming off 2017's three-year high of $97.9 billion. Islamic bonds, also called sukuk, are debt instruments that comply with Sharia principles. Sharia is an Islamic law that prohibits earning interest on loans and bars funding activities involving alcohol, pork, pornography or gambling. Oil-exporting Arab countries were among the largest sukuk issuers last year. Saudi Arabia, for one, issued a sovereign sukuk worth $9 billion \u2014 the largest ever Islamic bond. But higher oil prices have resulted in \u201ca decline in financing needs in some of the (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries,\u201d said Mohamed Damak, senior director of financial services research and global head of Islamic finance at S&P Global Ratings, in a conference call last week. The Gulf Cooperation Council is made up of six Arab nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Those countries were forced to diversify their revenue sources when oil prices slumped and stayed at multi-year lows from 2015 to 2017. In addition to current higher oil prices, the better fiscal discipline that the countries now have \u2014 from cutting spending and subsidies when oil revenue fell \u2014 has given them fewer reasons to replicate last year\u2019s large sukuk deals, Mohamed said. 'Structural constraints' in Islamic finance The decline in sukuk issuance adds to challenges confronting Islamic finance, which has seen growth slowing despite efforts to expand the sector outside its traditional markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The industry has seen some new participants outside Muslim-majority countries in recent years, but their presence hasn\u2019t helped Islamic finance gain much wider traction. In fact, the industry\u2019s growth has been slowing for five straight years, according to the latest Global Islamic Finance Report released this month. In 2017, the size of the Islamic financial services industry increased 6 percent from the prior year to $2.431 trillion, slowing from 2016's 7 percent growth, the report said. Experts identified one big hurdle that\u2019s preventing the industry from growing faster: The lack of standardization. Currently, many jurisdictions interpret Sharia differently, which leads to differences in how products are structured and the way disputes are resolved. \u201cGreater standardisation in these areas would help sukuk gain wider acceptance among international investors,\u201d Bashar Al Natoor, senior director and global head of Islamic finance for Fitch Ratings, said in a report. \u201cWe think that structural constraints mean growth may be steady but unspectacular,\u201d he added.

The Swiss bank\u2019s regional chief economist and chief investment officer turns to look at me. I recognize his chiseled features, his slight smile and short hair, turning grey at the sides. But something is not right. Mr. Kalt looks a little pale. As he breathes, his head and shoulders move up and down, as if he is floating. This is not the real Mr. Kalt. It is a computer-cloned image on a wall screen \u2014 part of a UBS project into the future of banking. Mr. Kalt, aged 49, is well-known in Switzerland as a commentator. Much of his job involves briefing UBS clients on the outlook for the world\u2019s economies and financial markets. By cloning him using the computer gaming industry\u2019s latest animation techniques, he could serve many more account holders. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. As digital disruption gathers pace, retail and private banks in Switzerland\u2014 the world\u2019s biggest center for cross-border wealth management \u2014 are travelling in two directions at once. To cut costs, they are automating processes and services, including using \u201crobo-advisers\u201d. But to increase revenues, they are also looking to provide high-value services \u2014 via humans \u2014 to their wealthiest clients. Cloned advisers \u201cmight be a way to bridge that gap\u201d and provide \u201ca kind of high-touch service at scale,\u201d says Matthias Koller, project manager at UBS\u2019s Wealth Management Innovation Lab. Meeting this digital version of Mr. Kalt raises a host of questions, however. Is a clone really more helpful for human advisers than a sheaf of documents? What value does a digital personality add, compared with a neutral avatar? Is it possible, in an animated \u201chyper reality\u201d, to feel as if you are working with a human being? Is this a good way of doing business with a bank \u2014 or are there privacy issues? \u201cOur mandate is to explore, to open the field . . . and then define what is really the sweet spot,\u201d says Mr. Koller. A virtual Daniel Kalt I can confirm that a familiar face makes more interesting what might otherwise have been a dull presentation of facts and charts. Mr. Kalt is activated via a small touch pad and a voice recognition system. \u201cGood day. My name is Daniel Kalt. I am regional chief investment officer in Switzerland,\u201d he says. So far he speaks only German and his words do not match exactly his lip movements. Mr. Koller says the software for syncing English is better. Soon he has Mr. Kalt describing the outlook for the US economy, company profits and the main drivers in global markets. But there are limits to his knowledge. I ask for his views on Brexit. There is a slight pause, and a stumped Mr. Kalt offers to talk about global asset allocations. A question about the outlook for the UK economy yields: \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for that.\u201d Mr. Koller points out that at this stage Mr. Kalt is meant as an aid for advisers, rather than for clients (or journalists) to test. In the jargon of the robot industry, he is a \u201ccobot\u201d or collaborative robot. His areas of expertise will be extended according to demand, but UBS advisers who have used the technology have warned against \u201ca system that pretends to know everything but actually knows nothing,\u201d says Mr. Koller. One ambition of the design team, which is working with IBM on Mr. Kalt\u2019s dialogue and conversation skills, is to build a better relationship between client and clone. On the screen, Mr. Kalt can wink, broaden his smile \u2014 and fall asleep. The sensors could notice that I am not wearing a tie \u2014 and remove his, Mr. Koller says. \u201cHe would change his shirt, because you have a blue one. He would maybe want to build up a rapport with you.\u201d Today, he is hardly over friendly. Mr. Kalt is powered by computer equipment hidden in a cupboard. One day, he might appear on a laptop or mobile, and UBS could add clones of other colleagues. The assumption of his programmers, however, is that interactive animation techniques in three or five years\u2019 time will have improved so \u201cyou can hardly differentiate whether it\u2019s a real or digital person,\u201d says Mr. Koller. Some clients may worry about security. Client meetings are not recorded and Mr. Kalt disappears when he is not needed. But UBS is keen to know how clients react. \u201cFor some it\u2019s just a TV screen. For others, it is a window on the world,\u201d says Mr. Koller. Earlier, I had met the real Mr. Kalt for coffee in a Zurich caf\u00e9. In life, he gesticulates a lot with his hands \u2014 not a characteristic shown by his clone. He was imaged by a specialist company in Serbia last winter \u2014 hence the clone\u2019s pale tone. The animation was by New Zealand\u2019s FaceMe, some of whose employees worked on the Lord of the Rings films. Talking to his clone was an \u201camazing experience\u201d, Mr. Kalt says. He notices some differences. The clone raises eyebrows individually, for example, which he says he never does. UBS is not claiming perfection, however. \u201cIt is about exploring the limits of technology, exploring what you can do with clients, how they will react,\u201d Mr. Kalt says. Eventually, \u201cthe clone might know a lot more detail than I do . . . I will learn to speak Chinese and Spanish\u201d. Nevertheless, (the real) Mr. Kalt is not worried about his job security. He believes he \u201ccan perhaps have more empathy and feeling for the client\u201d. We drink coffee together, I do not have to press a touch pad for a response. We talk about a broad range of subjects \u2014 including Brexit. \u201cThis clone can\u2019t do the job I do at the moment,\u201d Mr. Kalt says, \u201cbut it is just the beginning.\u201d More from the Financial Times: City chiefs braced for a \u2018global battle for skills\u2019 Education must transform to make people ready for AI Investment key to securing human role in robotic world "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/24/105229066-GettyImages-961740706.jpg?v=1532720892", "time": "2018-07-20T18:26:18-0400", "author": "Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "President Donald Trump has multiple reasons as to why he should take control of the Federal Reserve.

In essence, it is possible that six of the seven Board members will be put in place by Trump. The Federal Open Market Committee has 12 members and sets the nation\u2019s monetary policy. Seven of the 12 are the members of the Board of Governors. Five additional are Federal Reserve district bank presidents. Other than the head of the Fed bank in New York, who was nominated by the president, the other four can only take their positions as district bank presidents if the board in Washington agrees to their hiring. One of these, the Fed Bank president in Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, is already arguing for no further rate increases. show chapters Trump\u2019s comments on the Fed were a big deal. Here\u2019s why 6:19 PM ET Fri, 20 July 2018 | 02:05 Second, Regulation Following the passage of the Dodd Frank Act in July 2010, the Fed was given enormous power to regulate the banking industry. It moved quickly to implement a number of new rules. The Fed set up a system that would penalize banks that failed to obey its new rules. These rules included setting limits as to how big an individual bank could be; how much money the banks had to invest in fed funds and Treasurys as a percent of their assets; which loans were desirable and which were not; where the banks had to obtain their funding and many, many, more up to and including how much a bank could pay its investors in dividends. These rules have meaningfully slowed bank investments in the economy (the Volcker Rule) and they have had a crippling effect on bank lending in the housing markets (other agencies have had an impact here also). Thus, of all of the government agencies the Fed has been possibly the most restrictive. The president has already moved to correct these excesses by putting in place a new Fed Governor (Randal Quarles) to regulate the banking industry. Three, Killing Economic Growth In the second quarter of 2018, the growth in non-seasonally adjusted money supply (M2) has been zero. That\u2019s right, the money supply did not grow at all. This is because the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet ultimately by $50 billion per month. In addition, the Fed has raised interest rates seven times since Q4 2015. Supposedly there are five more rate increases coming. This is the tightest monetary policy since Paul Volcker headed the institution in the mid-1980s. It will be recalled his policies led to back-to-back recessions. Current Fed monetary policy is directly in conflict with the president\u2019s economic goals. Moreover, the Treasury is estimating it will pay $415 billion in interest on the federal debt in this fiscal year. A better estimate might be $450 billion if rates keep going up. There are a lot of bridges and tunnels and jobs that could be created with this money. Then there is inflation. It is likely to rise if the Fed eases its policies. If that happens paying down the federal debt becomes easier. On a less desirable note, higher interest rates lower real estate values. Lower rates that stimulate inflation increase real estate values. Bottom Line The president can and will take control of the Fed. It may be recalled when the law was written creating the Federal Reserve the secretary of the Treasury was designated as the head of the Federal Reserve. We are going to return to that era. Like it or not the Fed is about to be politicized.

The market's gain has slowed this year as the administration has implemented new tariffs on countries, with the benchmark index up 4.9 percent for 2018 through Thursday. Trump added the market would likely be much higher if he didn\u2019t escalate the trade issues with China and the rest of the world. \u201cWe are being taking advantage of and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have a higher stock market right now. \u2026 It could be 80 percent [since the election] if I didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d The president also said he is willing to slap tariffs on every Chinese good imported to the U.S. should the need arise. \"I'm ready to go to 500,\" Trump added. The reference is to the dollar amount of Chinese imports the U.S. accepted in 2017 \u2014 $505.5 billion to be exact, compared with the $129.9 billion the U.S. exported to China, according to Census Bureau data. So far in the trade war between the two largest economic powers in the world, the U.S. has slapped tariffs on just $34 billion of Chinese products, which China met with retaliatory duties. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Almost all of Trump's predecessors steered clear of Fed critiques in the interest of making sure that interest rates were set to whatever was best for the economy and not to boost anyone's political fortunes. The Trump administration, of course, has been anything but typical, and the Trump comments, if anything, were consistent with a president who cares little for convention and is willing to speak his mind on virtually anything. \u201cSomebody would say, \u2018Oh, maybe you shouldn\u2019t say that as president,'\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC. \"I couldn\u2019t care less what they say, because my views haven\u2019t changed.\u201d The closest analog with Trump's apparent efforts to influence interest rates \u2014 he prefers the Fed keep them low \u2014 was how former President Richard Nixon arm-twisted Arthur Burns to maintain loose monetary policy as Nixon sought re-election in 1972. \"I don\u2019t want to go out of town fast,\u201d Nixon told Burns in one conversation, according to tapes of conversations between the two. Concerns about too much liquidity in the economy were \"just bulls---,\" the president added. That didn't work out particularly well: As the 1970s economy continued to grow, inflation took root thanks to low rates and remained stubbornly in place until the early 1980s, when then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker had to tighten policy sharply. That in turn pushed the economy into recession but also helped slay the inflation problem and paved the way for the most powerful growth the economy had seen in the post-World War II era. Drew Angerer | Getty Images President Donald Trump (R) introduces his nominee for the chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. There are few other examples. George H.W. Bush lamented that Alan Greenspan's reluctance to cut rates more aggressively in the early 1990s helped push the economy into a recession that paved the way for Bill Clinton's election. But his criticisms came in 1998 \u2014 six years after Bush left office. Ronald Reagan also reportedly complained about monetary policy. The New York Times reported in 1982 that Reagan considered Volcker's strategy \"erratic,\" though he ultimately was hailed as a hero. It all makes Trump's comments all the more striking. He told CNBC that he was \"not thrilled\" about the rate hikes, enacted by a Fed whose chairman, Jerome Powell, was a Trump appointee. The Fed has approved two hikes this year and is expected to hike twice more before 2018 ends and perhaps another three times in 2019, according to current projections. Trump worries that the hikes will derail economic progress \"because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I am not happy about it. But at the same time I\u2019m letting them do what they feel is best.\u201d Later in the afternoon, after CNBC aired an excerpt of an interview that will be run Friday at 6 am, the White House said the president did not mean to impugn Fed independence. \"Of course the President respects the independence of the Fed,\" the statement said. Indeed, Powell in a recent interview said that he has felt no political pressure from the White House. CNBC's Steve Liesman reported Thursday afternoon that Powell and Trump have not met since Powell took the chairman's position in February. \"We do our work in a strictly nonpolitical way, based on detailed analysis, which we put on the record transparently, and we don't ... take political considerations into account,\" Powell said in a recent interview with Marketplace. \"I would add though that no one in the administration has said anything to me that really gives me concern on this front.\" Some former Fed officials, though, said they were concerned about the president's comments. Former Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin told CNBC the criticism is \"not particularly welcome\" and potentially a \"danger sign.\" Former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher added that \"no president should interfere with the workings of the Fed.\" But another former governor, Larry Lindsey, said he does not believe the president's remarks will impact policy. \"As an attack on the independence of the Fed, this just wasn't one, especially Trump-adjusted,\" Lindsey said. \"No, I do not think this is going to have any effect, and I don't think this is an attack on the independence of the Fed.\" Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the year when Reagan was elected and when he commented on the Fed. \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.

Toys R Us workers who lost their jobs when the heavily indebted retailer collapsed are talking to two buyout firms about a possible hardship fund \u2014 but a third, billionaire investor Steven Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust, is refusing to answer their emails. KKR and Bain, which took the company private in partnership with Vornado in 2005, are considering providing some financial help for workers who were hardest hit by the toy chain\u2019s bankruptcy last year and ultimate liquidation. Criticism over the treatment of workers has led some public pension funds in the US to reconsider investments with the two firms. Vornado, which was an equal partner with KKR and Bain in the leveraged buyout that loaded the retailer with more than $5bn of debt, has shunned discussions with representatives of former employees, according to people familiar with the talks. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. Vornado is structured as a permanent capital vehicle and does not raise outside money on a regular schedule, so has not experienced the same pressure from investors. Creditors seized control of Toys R Us in April, announcing the closure of all its stores and telling 30,000 fired workers they would not be receiving the severance benefits they expected. Former employees are trying to enforce their claims against the retailer in bankruptcy court. But they are unlikely to have any legal recourse against the trio of former owners, whom they contend are also to blame. Instead, they have mounted a ferocious campaign of public criticism, and worked to apply pressure via the buyout funds\u2019 investors. Workers and their representatives have scheduled meetings with Bain Capital investors in California, Ohio, Maryland and Pennsylvania, who have collectively provided the firm with about $2bn since 2012, to press their concerns. Two state-run pension funds, in Minnesota and Washington, are already reconsidering future investments in KKR funds. Laid-off workers plan to take the argument to Vornado on Friday. They will hold a protest rally at a San Francisco office tower that is co-owned by the fund. Jim Baker, a campaigner at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said he had contacted Mr Roth five times since workers wrote their letter in April, but received no reply. Mr Roth could not be reached for comment; Vornado did not reply to a request for comment. Industry experts say any hardship assistance for Toys R Us workers would probably have to come from buyout executives\u2019 own pockets, because the funds cannot demand money from clients to cover payments they have no legal obligation to make. The dialogue over a hardship fund was welcome, said Eddie Iny, a co-ordinator of the Rise Up Retail campaign that focuses on low-wage workers. But he added that it was likely to fall short of the $75m in severance benefits that workers had been counting on. \u201cWe hope that KKR and Bain will do more and call on Vornado and the creditors to join this effort and contribute their share towards the laid-off Toys R Us workers and their families,\u201d Mr Iny said. KKR wrote to 10 congressional Democrats earlier this month stating its \u201cdesire to help\u201d those who lost their jobs in the Toys R Us bankruptcy. \u201cWe believe we have found a path outside of the bankruptcy process to help those who need it the most,\u201d the firm said. Bain Capital declined to comment, but people familiar with the discussions said its representatives had also joined talks with workers.

While making for more eye-popping headlines out of the Oval Office, the president's complaints that rising interest rates are hampering economic progress did not move the fed funds futures market, where traders make bets about the Fed's future moves. Market participants still expect the Fed to hike twice more this year, with the probability for increases in September and December changing little after comments from Trump in a CNBC interview and on his Twitter feed. \"While Trump\u2019s comments on how he was 'not thrilled' by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate rises could create a sense of uncertainty over Washington\u2019s Dollar policy, it is unlikely to derail the Fed from gradually raising interest rates,\" Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at forex brokerage FXTM, said in a note. show chapters Trump\u2019s comments on the Fed were a big deal. Here\u2019s why 6:19 PM ET Fri, 20 July 2018 | 02:05 Indeed, the CME Group's FedWatch tracker indicated on Friday a 91 percent chance of a September move and a 61 percent probability of another hike in December. In fact, the December reading actually was about 2 percentage points higher than on Thursday before Trump lamented rising rates in a CNBC interview. Trump amped up his Fed criticism Friday, but markets still weren't expecting central bank officials to take the remarks to heart. \"Trump\u2019s verbal intervention is likely to hit a brick wall, as heightened rate hike expectations ensure that the Dollar reigns supreme across currency markets,\" Otunuga said. \"I don\u2019t think the market will react too much. This is typical stream of consciousness Trump with an unfortunate comment,\" added David Nelson, chief strategist at Belpointe. \"We\u2019re getting used to it now.\" Still, there continued to be worries that Trump's railing about Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policy setters could compromise the central bank's independence. Most presidents have steered clear of commenting on monetary policy on the belief that the Fed should set rates based on what's best for the economy free of political concerns. \"So somebody would say, \u2018Oh, maybe you shouldn\u2019t say that as president.' I couldn\u2019t care less what they say, because my views haven\u2019t changed,\" Trump told CNBC, after calling Powell \"a good man.\" Those kinds of comments will have market pros watching how Fed policy unfolds. \"We understand that Fed policy is run by a committee, but the focus will be on Powell, and we worry that he can't win; regardless of what he does, his motives will now be questioned,\" Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said in his daily note. \"Anti-Powell tweets from Trump are likely by year-end, an irritant the markets could do without.\" Similar sentiment was expressed elsewhere. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at forex traders Oanda, worried that pressure from Trump \"could be a major risk for the economy\" if it knocks the Fed off its gradual tightening path. \"Ultimately, I don\u2019t expect the Fed to be influenced but that doesn\u2019t mean Trump won\u2019t find an alternative way to deal with the issues, even if such solutions are controversial and prove ineffective or self-defeating,\" Erlam said. And Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said Trump is making himself look like \"a bit of a hypocrite\" because it is the president's pro-growth policies, including tax cuts and spending increases, that have helped push the Fed into its tightening stance. \"He was the one who cut taxes and promised or delivered big spending aimed at creating jobs and raising incomes.

I don't really \u2014 I am not happy about it. But at the same time I\u2019m letting them do what they feel is best,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen. James Lawler Duggan | Reuters Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives testimony on the economy and monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, July 17, 2018. The Fed has raised rates twice so far in 2018 and has indicated two more hikes before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he believes the economy is strong enough for the Fed to continue on the path of normalization. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, said economic growth could top 4 percent for a quarter or two. On top of that, unemployment is near historic lows and inflation is now running around the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. However, O\u2019Driscoll doesn\u2019t see why that should matter when it comes to increasing rates. \u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with strong economic growth and a low unemployment rate. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis, \u201ctotally\u201d agrees. He said the markets are discounting another 75 basis points of hikes between now and 2020, while the Fed is indicating 150 basis points from here. \u201cWhile they think they are moving gradual, relative to what\u2019s priced into the markets, relative to what other central banks are doing, [and with what] \u2026 will likely happen to the dollar, none of those developments to my mind are gradual hikes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively aggressive. And the markets back the president on this.\u201d The U.S. dollar, stocks and Treasury yields all fell on Thursday after Trump\u2019s statements. LaVorgna has argued that the rate hikes could drive the Treasury yield curve to invert right after its September meeting. That could lead to a recession by next summer, he has said. A yield curve is the difference between the shorter maturity Treasury yields and longer-duration yields. When it inverts, the long-term Treasurys have a lower yield than the short-term ones. \u201cThe Fed has generally caused many recessions,\u201d LaVorgna said Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s not make it like these folks, as admirable and as hard as they work, are this Delphic oracle that can forecast things with precision. They can\u2019t.\u201d Fed officials did not comment on the president's remarks. The White House, in a statement after the interview excerpt aired on CNBC, emphasized that Trump did not mean to influence the Fed's decision-making process. \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Jeff Cox and Patti Domm contributed to this report.

The financial services giant agreed to buy Charles River Development for $2.6 billion in an all-cash deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, State Street also said it will suspend a $950 million share repurchase through the end of the year to help finance the transaction.

Brown | AFP | Getty Images A container delivery truck drives past stacked piles of shipping containers at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California on July 6, 2018, including one from China Shipping, a conglomerate under the direct administration of China's State Council. The acceleration of U.S. trade actions poses a risk to S&P 500 earnings through falling export revenues and rising input costs for American companies, according to Goldman Sachs. A 10 percent tariff on all imports from China would lower Goldman\u2019s 2019 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate by 3 percent, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote. If \"tensions spread\" and a 10 percent tariff were imposed on all U.S. imports, Goldman said, it would lower its 2019 EPS estimate by 15 percent to $145 a share. \u201cTariffs benefit some domestic industries, but pose a risk to S&P 500 earnings through reduced revenues (lower exports) and weaker margins (higher input costs),\u201d Kostin wrote. \u201cOur economists now assign a 60 percent probability that the U.S. imposes tariffs on the recently targeted $200 billion of imports from China.\u201d President Donald Trump and his administration have defended an initiative of \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade in recent months, demanding that some of the nation\u2019s economic allies offer the U.S. a better deal in an effort to curb Washington\u2019s trade deficit and promote American exports. \u201cWhen you\u2019re almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you can\u2019t lose a Trade War!\u201d Trump tweeted in June. \u201cThe U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart!\u201d tweet The United States, which already imposed tariffs on $79 billion of goods and services and proposed an additional $702 billion on other foreign goods, is on track to levy taxes on 27 percent of all imports, the Goldman strategist said. The White House\u2019s pivot toward more protectionist policies has sparked retaliatory measures from other countries, leaving many economists concerned that the tit-for-tat dispute could ultimately slow global economic growth. Still, any negative impact of a worsening trade war would have an outsized impact on certain industries, Kostin added, underscoring U.S. oil and coal companies with large international supply chains. \u201cIndustries heavily relying on imports theoretically face the greatest supply chain risk from rising trade tensions. Petroleum and coal products, transportation, and computer and electronic products have the highest share of imported cost of goods sold, while services companies should be relatively insulated.\u201d Certain tactics, such as investing in companies with higher domestic sales, would likely outperform if the trade dispute worsens, Kostin said. The bank\u2019s domestic sales basket has outperformed the S&P 500 by 130 basis points since May, easily besting its collection of stocks with high China sales exposure; that portfolio has lagged the market by 570 basis points since May 22. Constituents of Goldman Sachs\u2019 domestic sales basket include familiar names such as retailer Target, CVS Health and Wells Fargo; none of the three companies has significant overseas sales. Other financial companies, such as Charles Schwab and U.S. Bancorp, tend to have reduced foreign exposure. As another possible trade play, Goldman options strategist Rocky Fishman recommends overwriting equities with 12-month to 24-month SPX index call options. This strategy, using a December 2019 strike call, will outperform if the index rises by less than 9 percent, the strategists explained. \"Our base case forecast is that S&P 500 rises 2 percent to 2850 at year-end 2018 and by 7 percent to 3000 at year-end 2019,\" Kostin wrote. \"In the event of a severe global trade war, our 2019 earnings per share forecast could equal $145 and the forward P/E multiple could contract by 10 percent to 15 times, dragging S&P 500 to 2200 by year-end 2018.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/10/104835653-GettyImages-840343170.jpg?v=1533564855", "time": "2018-07-23T14:53:53-0400", "author": "Ronald C.

Modra | Sports Imagery | Getty Images The year is only halfway through and already 2018 is on track to be the most volatile since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note published Monday. Morgan Stanley defines a \"large move\" as an unexpected single-day change in price compared with \"what was implied by options markets at the time\" in global stocks, bonds and currencies, the note said. The firm charted multiple markets around the world, ranging from currencies such as the Australian dollar and the euro to commodities such as Brent crude oil and copper. And of course, the firm looked at U.S. stocks. Number of 'large moves' rising across asset classes The large moves Morgan Stanley is tracking are so-called \"3-sigma\" events, which is a statistical way of calculating data that is within three standard deviations of a mean. 2018 is on track to have more than 25 such moves in financial markets, the most since 2008 when there were nearly 35, according to the firm. \"Surprises (large moves relative to expectations) are becoming more common across asset classes,\" wrote strategist Andrew Sheets. Sheets and team believe that \"tightening monetary policy and geopolitical risks\" may be helping boost this year's uptick in volatility. And the remainder of the year is set to be even wilder because of the U.S. midterm elections, CFRA analysts said in a note Monday. \"Since [World War II] the S&P 500\u2019s average daily price volatility was highest during midterm election years, in general, and third-quarters of [those years], in particular,\" the note said. CFRA found, when breaking down the four years of the election cycle, that midterm election years had an average daily volatility of 116 percent. Those years are 10 percent above pre-election years, which have an average daily volatility of 106 percent, and markedly above election years and inauguration years, at 93 percent and 84 percent, respectively.

While automotive companies asking investors for cash back to support operations is a standard part of the negotiating process, Tesla has repeatedly said it doesn't need the cash. However, the Sunday memo, in which the company asked investors to return a \"meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016,\" suggests otherwise and leaves market watchers wondering if Tesla is being truthful about its cash position. The company lost about $2 billion last year and burned about $3.4 billion in cash after capital investments. At the end of March, Tesla had about $2.7 billion in cash. Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to the report in a tweet on Monday, saying, \"Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.\" TWEET The company later released a longer statement explaining the move. \"We asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete, and any changes with these suppliers would improve our future cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3,\u201d it said. But Jamie Albertine, an automotive analyst who tracks Tesla, said, \"They cannot achieve profitability in the third quarter with one-time windfalls.\" \"If that\u2019s what this ends up qualifying as, the market will absolutely sell off on that news. It will view its profitability as unsustainable. That\u2019s the key risk,\" he said Monday on \"Closing Bell.\" Still, his firm, Consumer Edge Research, gave the stock an overweight rating. \"We're optimistic,\" he said. Joe White | Reuters Tesla Model 3 Analysts broke down a few things Tesla will need to do to persuade Wall Street that it will be profitable. Revenue Colin Rusch, Wall Street analyst at Oppenheimer, who specializes in technology, said the No. 1 thing the company can do is increase its gross margin \u2014 \"particularly on the Model 3, toward their target levels,\" he said Monday on \"Closing Bell.\" In the second quarter, Tesla produced more than 28,000 Model 3 sedans, a number that was triple the prior quarter. Still, many investors wonder if that was a one-off or if the company can continue producing a higher output rate. Since the company's IPO eight years ago, Tesla has only had two profitable quarters. Progress Tesla can also illustrate its worth to investors by showing what it's doing with its working capital. \"They\u2019ve had a positive working capital,\" Rusch said. \"As they ramp up, they need to continue to show that that\u2019s the case.\" Short-term cash reserves Tesla needs to \"show that they've got enough runway on their short-term cash to meet their needs over the next 12 months,\" Rusch said. \"The thing that we're looking at are the 2019 SolarCity bonds that are due in November and where those are trading,\" he said. \"We think that's a real indication of what the credit markets are looking at. And those are down. They're yielding 10 percent right now. I think that suggests there's an awful lot of concern around the liquidity for this organization.\" Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage":

President Donald Trump looks on as his nominee for the chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Price stability, regardless of how it is measured and defined, is the ultimate litmus test of monetary policy. And inflation is always \u2014 regardless of sociopolitical outlook \u2014 a monetary phenomenon. Those are the key tenets of the Chicago school of economics, as well as the \u201ckiller\u201d arguments of one of its best known proponents \u2014 the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman. Friedman was probably smiling somewhere when President Donald Trump told the Federal Reserve last week that \u201cI don\u2019t like all of this work that we\u2019re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.\" As a graduate student, I remember the Friedman grin that looked like he was saying \u201cI told you so.\u201d What Trump said was a paraphrase of Friedman\u2019s claim that fiscal policy stimuli were ineffective \u2014 that is, their medium-term impact is zero or negative, because the ensuing higher inflation and budget deficits force the Fed to initiate credit tightening that usually leads to growth recessions and rising unemployment. Worrying inflation outlook Friedman was basing that view on his empirical research (part of his Nobel distinction) showing the vanishing fiscal multiplier, which is fiscal policy\u2019s stimulus to economic activity. That was also part of his political fight against deficit-financed economic policies, advocates of big government and an ever-expanding public sector. In case you are wondering what Friedman did advise, you can probably guess that money for him was the only policy lever. Pick any monetary aggregate (a measure of the money stock), he said, preferably the one whose growth is highly correlated with the growth of the economy, and keep it moving along on a path that is consistent with price stability. Now, that brings us back to the Fed and the legion of its critics and would-be advisors. From the above, one can easily infer that inflation is the only binding constraint on the Fed\u2019s policy. Those who disagree with that conclusion are mostly the people alleging that the Fed is Wall Street\u2019s handmaiden, regularly caving to government pressure in the run-up to elections, and the key architect of the (four-year) election business cycle. I look at that as largely irrelevant chatter that in no way invalidates the view that inflation \u2014 or, more precisely, inflation expectations \u2014 is a guide the Fed can only ignore at the peril of debilitating recessions and crashing asset values. Where do we stand on inflation now? Not sitting pretty, really. The key inflation indicators are hitting at, or above, the upper levels of their target ranges. They are showing an accelerating pattern rather than a stabilizing trend. In particular, that\u2019s the case with the personal consumption expenditures index and the consumer price index. Indicators underlying inflation pressures, such as the unit labor costs and producer prices, are not providing any grounds for optimism either. China and the EU won\u2019t give up trade surpluses The unit labor costs (wages minus labor productivity) in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year shot up at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent \u2014 a big jump from zero growth in the first nine months of last year. That is quite a hit to profit margins that will force businesses to respond with rising prices, which always stick in a growing economy. That is typically what happens on the way to an accelerating general price inflation. Producer prices last month told the same story with an annual increase of 4.3 percent. They were driven by energy costs soaring at an annual rate of 17.2 percent. All that has already found its way to consumer wallets and corporate balance sheets. The most recent business surveys are pointing to high activity levels, rising capacity constraints and slowing delivery schedules, with prices in June showing more than two years of consecutive monthly increases. Trade disputes \u2014 if they were to lead to supply shortages and price distortions \u2014 are another problem in the current inflation outlook. Sadly, the Chinese and the Europeans are ready to fight to keep their surpluses on U.S. trades. Speaking in the name of the EU at the G-20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting last Saturday, France refused to even consider the American offer. The Chinese did the same thing, but much more elegantly: Beijing did not send its key trade negotiator, leaving the EU and the IMF to gang up on the U.S. And then there is a hugely expansionary fiscal policy the Fed has to contend with. Last Thursday, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget announced that the deficit for this fiscal year, ending September 30, will come in at $890 billion \u2014 more than double the estimate of $440 billion it had published in March 2017. How is the Fed reacting to all that? Liquidity withdrawals are continuing. In the course of the second quarter, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet shrank by $150 billion, showing a 3 percent decline from its year-earlier levels, but still remaining at a massive $3.6 trillion on July 18. That is a very gradual and a very cautious pace of a long-overdue \u201cpolicy normalization.\u201d The bond markets are reacting in kind. The Treasury\u2019s yield curve has been roughly stable since the beginning of July, with a mild tension developing on the benchmark 10-year note. The real short-term interest rate, measured by the effective federal funds rate and the CPI, is still minus 1 percent, signifying a vastly expansionary monetary policy. Investment thoughts Trump\u2019s displeasure about the Fed\u2019s intention to keep rising interest rates sounds like an unwise dig at a central bank that seems hopelessly behind the curve in preventing an inflationary flare-up. The president could help by getting the Russians and the Saudis to pump more oil to bring energy costs down. So far this year, oil prices are up 18.4 percent, and there is no telling how far the U.S. consumer price inflation could go if energy prices were to keep rising. That is all in Trump\u2019s hands. There is nothing the Fed can do about it. Fixed-income markets look like a good place to avoid. Defensive equity positions are my choice.

Bitcoin continued its rally Monday, shrugging off regulatory and security worries that have dragged down cryptocurrency prices this year. The world's largest and most popular digital currency rose 5 percent to a high of $7,785.37 according to data from CoinDesk, and is up roughly 20 percent in the past week. It broke above the $7,000 level for the first time in a month last Tuesday following news that asset-management giant BlackRock will set up a working group to explore cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Grayscale, which manages $2 billion in assets, said in a report last week that it's seeing more institutions interested in cryptocurrency products, which eToro's Matthew Newton said adds to the long-term upside for bitcoin. He also pointed to anticipation surrounding approval of a bitcoin ETF, which the Securities and Exchange Comission is reportedly due to decide in August. \"In the long-run all of these points are very bullish,\" said Newton, an analyst at eToro. \"Technically, on the charts, what happened last week was very positive, but getting through these levels will be critical in the short term action.\" if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-C3eoe\"),window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"C3eoe\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"C3eoe\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); From a technical perspective, Newton Advisor founder and analyst Mark Newton is also watching the \"formidable area of resistance\" near $8,000.

Bitcoin is still down more than 60 percent from its all-time high near $20,000 in December. It and other cryptocurrencies have come under global scrutiny this year amid thefts, frauds around initial coin offerings, market manipulation and its potential for money laundering. The entire market capitalization for cryptocurrencies has dropped by more than 50 percent this year, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Dimon also referenced the investigation by the Commerce Department into imports as having hurt the U.S. auto industry. Second quarter gross domestic product will be released on Friday and is expected to show a 3.8 percent pace of growth, according to FactSet. That's up from 2 percent annual growth in the first quarter. Thus far, the U.S. has put tariffs on just $34 billion of Chinese products, which China met with retaliatory duties. The White House is undergoing a two-month review process to look at a second round of tariffs, on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Dimon told CNN Money that Trump has \"raised serious issues that are pretty accurate\" when it comes to dealing with China but questioned the president's next steps for the U.S. \"I would remind folks that the president's team has already said, 'There will be no retaliation.' They've already been wrong,\" Dimon said in the interview. \"If I was the president, I'd be a little ticked off at some of my advisers, to tell you the truth.\" Dimon said that the trade war's expansion beyond China, with tariffs placed on U.S. allies in North America and Europe, has made a resolution \"complex.\" \"It raises the uncertainty a little bit,\" Dimon said.

Mayflower Advisors' Larry Glazer warned recently that a lot of investors are setting themselves up for pain by paying an \"absurd and ridiculous premium\" for small cap stocks. \"Investors are fearful, and they\u2019ve been positioning for the smallest stocks they can get their hands on, and the most domestic stocks they can get their hands on in hopes of escaping this trade war,\" the fund manager said Thursday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" So far this year, the Russell 2000 Index of small cap stocks has ripped nearly 11 percent year-to-date, while the broader S&P 500 Index is up almost 5 percent. Smaller companies have been captivating investors because they do most of their business in the United States and, therefore, insulated from trade war fallout. In addition, they've been big beneficiaries of President Donald Trump's massive tax reform package that passed late last year. Glazer, however, is doubtful that game plan will work. He contended the trade war will likely dissipate before the midterm elections, and spark a sudden, \"massive rotation\" in the market \u2014 thus hurting a lot of investors. \"He\u2019s [Trump] going to make a deal,\" Glazer said. \"The only people who want a trade war less than the American voters are the American politicians going into mid-term elections. And, the only people who want a trade war less than the American politicians and the voters, are the Europeans, the Mexicans, and the Canadians,\" he said. \"So we\u2019ve got all the cards, all the recipe for let\u2019s make a deal, truce or dare \u2014 Trump style,\" the investor added. With about $3 billion in assets under management, he believes the best play is to go big. According to Glazer, the biggest beneficiaries this year will ultimately be large cap multinational companies, emerging markets such as Mexico and Canada and financials. \"The long-term story in a war is buy on the sound of cannons, and you sell on the sound of trumpets. Well, we have cannons. You know there is a trade war going on. So, now is the time for investors to recognize that valuations trump all else,\" Glazer said.

Experts weigh in 2:54 PM ET Mon, 23 July 2018 | 03:50 The nationwide housing shortage continues but is especially troublesome for homebuyers with a budget of $250,000 or less, Susan Wachter, professor of real estate and of finance at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNBC on Monday. Rising labor, land and material costs are slowing down the supply, \"except at higher prices, which is simply not affordable for the great middle, and that\u2019s where we see the hit in ... existing sales,\" Wachter said on \"Power Lunch.\" Sales of existing homes are down for the third month in a row due to a shortage of properties, which results in higher prices and pushes some potential buyers out of the market. Existing home sales fell 0.6 percent in June, or 2.2 percent from June 2017. And as prices for new home construction increase, construction in general is on the decline. Housing starts, or the number of new residential housing projects, decreased in June, plunging 12.3 percent. The loss represents the third month in a row of declines or a nine-month low. \"That sets a price point for the existing sale market as well,\" Wachter said. And with inventory at historic lows and a lack of new construction, existing homeowners are holding on to their homes longer, Wachter noted. That spells trouble for first-time homebuyers and those looking to upgrade, such as growing families.

Both trade financial instruments known as derivatives with hedge funds, insurers, governments and other clients. United States regulators, however, get detailed information only about the derivatives traded by Goldman Sachs International. Thanks to a loophole in laws enacted in response to the financial crisis, trades by Goldman Sachs International Bank don\u2019t have to be reported. A decade after a financial crisis fueled in part by a tangled web of derivatives, regulators still have an incomplete picture of who holds what in this $600 trillion market. \u201cIt\u2019s a global market, so you really have to have a global set of data,\u201d said Werner Bijkerk, the former head of research at the International Organization of Securities Commissions, an umbrella group for regulators around the world overseeing derivatives markets. \u201cYou can start running \u2018stress tests\u2019 and see where the weaknesses are. With this kind of patchwork, you will never be able to see that.\u201d Derivatives are instruments whose values are derived from the prices of other things, like a stock or a barrel of oil or a bundle of mortgages. Originally designed to protect their holders against future risks, they evolved into vehicles that traders used for financial speculation. Unlike stocks, they often aren\u2019t traded over public exchanges, which means the market \u2014 and who is exposed to what \u2014 is opaque. Getty Images People walk past the entrance to the Goldman Sachs investment offices in Peterborough Court on October 10, 2016 in London, England. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law was supposed to improve regulators\u2019 ability to monitor derivatives. American banks had to start reporting specifics about their trades, including whom they traded with, to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The goal was to prevent a recurrence of the financial crisis, when fatal problems at Lehman Brothers caused a tidal wave of troubles at other banks that were connected through derivatives. In part because nobody could map out those connections, nobody knew where problems lurked, and fearful banks stopped lending to one another. But the Dodd-Frank Act contained a big gap: Banks don\u2019t have to disclose to American regulators their holdings of derivatives housed in certain offshore entities. The critical variable is whether the American parent company is legally on the hook to bail out its foreign subsidiary if it gets into trouble. As long as the answer is no, the foreign entity isn\u2019t subject to the Dodd-Frank requirements. The size and severity of this blind spot are hard to measure. One consequence is that United States regulators are unable to grasp the full exposure of American banks to their foreign rivals. Germany\u2019s troubled Deutsche Bank, for example, is one of the largest players in the derivatives market, and much of its derivatives trading occurs in foreign markets that are outside the purview of American regulators. That means they have limited visibility into United States banks\u2019 connections to Deutsche Bank. Other countries\u2019 regulators can seek information about those holdings, but they generally do not collect the same data that is reported to American regulators. The Dodd-Frank law \u201cdidn\u2019t really give a mandate to coordinate on the things that naturally would benefit most from coordination, one of which is the flow of information,\u201d said Guy Dempsey, a derivatives lawyer. Goldman, for example, reports its total exposure to the derivatives market as a single number: The bank had $45 billion in over-the-counter derivatives alone on its balance sheet at the end of 2017. Because of the trading in its Goldman Sachs International Bank unit and other foreign subsidiaries, a certain amount of those trades are invisible to American regulators. A Goldman spokesman said less than 1 percent of the bank\u2019s global derivatives activity wasn\u2019t visible to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, but he declined to comment further. For JPMorgan Chase, trades not reported to the commission account for less than 10 percent of all the bank\u2019s derivatives, a spokesman said. (The firm reported $56.5 billion in outstanding derivatives for 2017.) A Citigroup spokeswoman said the bank\u2019s European derivatives trades were made \u201cpredominantly\u201d through subsidiaries that reported their trades to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The portion of Bank of America\u2019s derivatives portfolio that isn\u2019t reported to regulators is not discernible in its public filings. A bank spokesman would say only that the percentage is small. A Morgan Stanley spokesman said \u201cvirtually all\u201d of its trades were reported to American regulators. The banks say that they aren\u2019t trying to hide anything and that in some cases they are responding to demands from overseas clients who don\u2019t want the United States government looking at their transactions. Even foreign bank regulators argue there\u2019s no reason American law should apply to financial instruments held outside the United States. \u201cThis problem, I think, is really driven more by regulators each wanting their own silo,\u201d said Sheila Bair, a former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u201cI think the industry would be fine with some type of consolidated reporting.\u201d Mr. Dempsey, the lawyer, said, \u201cWhat you have is a picture that has more clarity to it than what the regulators had in 2008, but you still don\u2019t have maximum clarity.\u201d Regulators can still monitor risk for individual institutions. The Federal Reserve, for example, can ask for specific information about derivatives trades as it sees fit. But because the trades aren\u2019t automatically reported, the regulator would have to decide which trades to ask about beforehand. Theoretically, the Fed could ask for banks to report every single trade, but the central bank hasn\u2019t done that. In October 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed a rule that would have closed the reporting loophole by requiring all American bank subsidiaries to report their derivatives exposure. It also would have subjected the subsidiaries to financial regulations that would have made derivatives trading less profitable. The banking industry opposed the rule. After President Trump took office, it was never authorized. Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission acknowledge that there is a problem. The agency noted in an April paper that the current reporting \u201ccannot provide regulators with a complete and accurate picture\u201d of risks in the market. Even so, Amir Zaidi, the director of the commission\u2019s market oversight division, said more data was available to regulators now than before the financial crisis, enough to enable \u201ceffective oversight.\u201d In a recent paper, a University of Maryland law professor, Michael Greenberger, argued that banks were exploiting the disclosure loophole and creating a major vulnerability for the financial system. The largest banks \u201chave engineered a way to evade Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulations at will,\u201d Mr. Greenberger wrote. He warned that in a period of financial stress, derivatives cause cascading losses. Because the ownership and connections of those derivatives remain murky, he wrote, \u201cthe economic chaos and harm of the 2008 financial meltdown may very well be repeated.\u201d Mr. Greenberger\u2019s warnings \u2014 published last month by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a progressive think tank \u2014 have been endorsed by the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Thomas M. Hoenig, who stepped down as vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April. Mr. Hoenig noted that the universe of derivatives was already very complicated, \u201cand so when you make it even more opaque in a foreign subsidiary, I think the ability to control outcomes is very different.\u201d He recalled earlier efforts to bring transparency to the derivatives markets. Such proposals were derailed by senior officials in the Clinton administration, and Mr. Hoenig warned against repeating that mistake.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen that aired Friday, Trump expressed frustration with the Fed's recent move to raise interest rates and said the central bank could disrupt the U.S. economic recovery. Trump then criticized the Fed monetary policy again in a tweet Friday. Tweet 1 Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have raised interest rates twice this year and have indicated two more are coming before the end of 2018. Grant, who was previously managing director and chief strategist at Hilltop Securities, said he doesn't agree with the central bank's \"return to normalcy.\" He said if the Fed continues to raise interest rates, it will slow down economic growth. \"I don't think the Fed should be raising interest rates at a time when Congress and the president under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is trying to grow the economy,\" Grant said. \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

One Wall Street analyst is especially excited over the potential of the company\u2019s self-driving division Waymo. \u201cWe see Waymo commercialization later this year as an additional positive catalyst given the company\u2019s technology leadership in a market with enormous TAM(s) [total addressable market] and potential for increased disclosure / separate capitalization over time,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in a note to clients Monday. \u201cWe would add to positions as we see the stock as under-owned and now supported by a compelling medium narrative on top of a durable high-quality name with meaningful value not currently reflected in the shares, in our view.\u201d Walmsley reaffirmed his buy rating and reiterated his $1,350 price target for Alphabet shares. Alphabet shares are outperforming the market so far this year. Its shares are up 15 percent year to date through Monday versus the S&P 500\u2019s 5 percent gain. Here's a roundup of analyst sentiment about Alphabet.

We\u2019re focused on reaching a more sustainable long term cost basis, not just finding one-time reductions for this quarter, and that\u2019s good for Tesla, our shareholders, and our suppliers who will also benefit from our increasing production volume and future growth opportunities. We asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete, and any changes with these suppliers would improve our future cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3. The remainder of our discussions with suppliers are entirely focused on future parts price and design or process changes that will help us lower fundamental costs rather than prior period adjustments of capex projects.

Bitcoin shook off a bearish two months after rising above $8,000 Tuesday but based on past behavior, another pullback could be coming, according to technical analysts that cover cryptocurrency. \u201cGiven that it has trended down so sharply since May, I wouldn\u2019t want to get too greedy,\u201d said Newton Advisor founder and analyst Mark Newton. \u201cLooking at cycles near term, this doesn't mean it will go back to its highs right away.\" Newton said he would still \u201cwait and see\" if bitcoin can recover based on the digital currency's behavior in the past month. Bitcoin had struggled to break above $7,000 until last week, and traded in the $6,000 range for most of July. It has fallen roughly 50 percent this year, and down 60 percent from its highs near $20,000 in December, according to data from CoinDesk. Analysts at Fundstrat are watching the 15-day daily moving average, often a proxy for longer-term trends, which has been trending positively for bitcoin. But the analysts agreed that some short-term indicators are overbought, which often signals a price pullback. Still, the firm expects any drop to be \"relatively shallow,\u201d according to technical strategist Rob Sluymer. \u201cIncrementally, it\u2019s positive action as the May-July downtrend has been reversed,\u201d said Sluymer, who is also a managing director at Fundstrat. Despite bitcoin's slump in 2018, the firm is hanging on to its $25,000 year-end price target. Fundstrat Managing Director and Head of Research Tom Lee said this week's 20 percent jump signals a return of bullish sentiment. \u201cA month ago, bitcoin was seen as broken, about to be regulated out of existence, and bubble with downside of $3,000,\u201d said Lee, who was formerly JPMorgan Chase's chief U.S. equity strategist. \u201cThe trajectory of the Bitcoin\u2019s narrative has inflected.\u201d if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":470,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-tiSOz\"),window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tiSOz\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); While $8,000 was an important move, last week\u2019s rise above $7,800 was even more significant, according to eToro Senior Market Analyst Mati Greenspan. \u201cOnce that was broken, $8,000 followed pretty easily,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cIf we can sustain above $7,800, that would be really bullish and would go a long way to impacting sentiment.\u201d The next level of resistance is $10,000, but even getting to $9,500 from $8,000 could be difficult, Greenspan said. Investors had a few reasons to be optimistic this week. Bitcoin began climbing above $7,000 last week following news that BlackRock confirmed it assembled a working group to look into cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology, blockchain. Anticipation of a bitcoin ETF decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in August has also been a source of enthusiasm for buyers. For now, Mark Newton is anticipating 5 to 10 percent dips and waiting for the fall for a meaningful price rise in bitcoin. \"We'll see a pullback in August,\" he said. \"Historically, you wanted to be invested in November and December.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/20/105342061-1532058299163co-founders-shopup.jpg?v=1532323747", "time": "2018-07-23T00:57:47-0400", "author": "ShopUp", "description": "Afeef Zaman, Siffat Sarwar and Ataur Chowdhury worked out that social media can mean big business for entrepreneurs.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/shopup-bangladesh-start-up-uses-facebook-to-help-micro-entrepreneurs.html", "title": "Facebook and 3 millennials are changing the start-up scene in Bangladesh", "keywords": [{"term": " ", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "millions", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "every day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "thousands", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than 300,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ShopUp Afeef Zaman", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Siffat Sarwar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ataur Chowdhury", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "ShopUp", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Afeef Zaman", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Siffat Sarwar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ataur Chowdhury", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "twenty", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "18-20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "3-5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2,500", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "300", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "one year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Zaman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BRAC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "98 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Zaman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "BRAC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just 35 minutes", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "DHL", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "more than 55 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "IndexMundi", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Zaman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bangladeshi", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "less than 30 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the International Labour Organization", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Afsana Zarin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Millions", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Taka", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "hundreds of thousands", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Bangladeshi Taka", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Bangladesh\u2019s", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Dhaka Tribune", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "May.", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "10,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "next year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Zaman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Bangladesh", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than $1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the past year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Singapore", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Zaman", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "YouTube", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "less than $1,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Indonesia", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "billion-dollar", "category": "MONEY"}], "body": " In Bangladesh, as across the world, millions of people log into Facebook every day. But rather than looking for escape from the stresses of the workplace, for many of those people Facebook is the workplace. That's because, behind a screen of cat memes, is a thriving network of thousands of entrepreneurs using the social media platform to take advantage of the country's rapidly growing e-commerce scene. Low start-up costs and an established user base mean that Facebook is an obvious choice for small, local merchants to reach wider, increasingly international, consumers beyond their traditional market. Indeed, today, more than 300,000 of the country's online retailers, selling clothing to cosmetics, run through Facebook, according to Facebook's advertising platform. ShopUp Afeef Zaman, Siffat Sarwar and Ataur Chowdhury, co-founders of ShopUp. The difficulty for those entrepreneurs, however, is gaining access to the capital to build up their stock and serve their new, enlarged audience. Though Bangladesh has an established microloan system \u2014 loans specifically for small entrepreneurs in less developed economies \u2014 it's hampered by cumbersome assessment processes and high interest rates. That's where Afeef Zaman, Siffat Sarwar and Ataur Chowdhury come in. The trio of twenty-somethings have created ShopUp, a platform designed to automate the credit assessment process for small business owners, cutting wait times by weeks and reducing loan operating costs from 18-20 percent to 3-5 percent. That also means slashing minimum loans from $2,500 to $300 and tie-in periods from one year to three months \u2014 a major win for fledgling entrepreneurs with less money to commit. \"The problem was not with default rates,\" 26-year-old Zaman told CNBC Make It. In fact, microlenders enjoy some of the lowest default rates in the world. BRAC, the world's largest non-government development organization, enjoys a repayment rate of 98 percent. \"It's that the existing methods for assessing microloans are too lengthy and costly, meaning many businesses struggle to get up and running\" he said. While ShopUp doesn't provide the loans itself, its algorithms mean that more microlenders can assess more loans more quickly \u2014 something that Zaman described as such a \"burning problem\" for BRAC that they signed up to work with ShopUp in just 35 minutes. In addition to helping with financing, ShopUp provides technical and business support to help small business owners get up and running on Facebook and other social platforms. It also works with DHL to automate the delivery process for domestic and international sales. That means more people will be able to build online businesses, which is vital for a country in which more than 55 percent of people are self-employed, according to data aggregator IndexMundi. \u201cFor a lot of people, entrepreneurship is a dream. For people in Bangladesh, it\u2019s a reality,\" said Zaman, who noted that the country lacks the levels of multinational employers enjoyed by many other economies. ShopUp believes their platform will be especially game-changing for Bangladeshi women. Currently, less than 30 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s workforce is female, according to the International Labour Organization, and fewer still are business owners. Afsana Zarin A merchant in Bangladesh sells her painted pottery on ShopUp's online platform. \u201cMillions of women in Bangladesh are unable to earn for themselves because of social and family issues. If you start a business on Facebook, you can earn lakhs of Taka (hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi Taka) while changing your child\u2019s diaper! All you need is determination,\u201d Sarwar, ShopUp\u2019s chief operations officer, told Bangladesh\u2019s Dhaka Tribune in May. ShopUp, which launched in 2016, plans to help finance 2,000 entrepreneurs this year, before expanding to 10,000 per quarter from next year. It will prioritize helping women entrepreneurs, whose businesses \u201ctend to focus on giving back to the community,\u201d according to Zaman. That, in turn, could help fast-track wider economic development across Bangladesh and beyond, he said. ShopUp is one of a number of tech companies hoping to catch a slice of growing entrepreneurship by offering financing.

While the four variables that are traditionally recession indicators aren\u2019t lining up right now, he sees another element in play \u2014 the real earnings yield. That is the most recent 12-month period of earnings per share divided by the current market price per share. \u201cThe real earnings yield has had a pretty good track history over the post-war period ... of kind of giving an idea of future return potential,\u201d Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, told CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cReal yield sits right on the cusp of the lower quartile and half of the bull markets in post-war history \u2014 more than half actually \u2014 have ended when the real yield fell to the lowest quartile,\u201d he said on \u201cPower Lunch.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s predicting a recession at the moment. Right now, Paulsen believes the market is highly valued and there are limits to how much higher the bull market can go. \u201cThe real risk is if the cycle ends. That\u2019s where the negative return potential comes in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the cycle continues, I think values will allow it to continue to rise.\u201d However, investors should be prepared. \u201cI\u2019d stay in the market but would diversify much more broadly and aggressively then we have up till now,\u201d he said. How to play it For one, international markets should be \u201cmaximally overweighted\u201d relative to U.S. stocks, Paulsen said. \u201cMost of issues are more pronounced here than they are abroad. Overseas markets are under-owned, undervalued, they have more accommodative policy officials, a number of good attributes,\u201d he noted. Paulsen would also raise a little cash, which would come in handy to scoop up opportunities during the next sell-off. \u201cIf we do hit another air pocket and go below February lows, there\u2019s going to be a lot of panic and you\u2019ll have some dry powder available as people give away good assets.\u201d He would add a little gold for the same reason, since panic from a sell-off would send the precious metal higher. A commodity exchange-traded fund would also be a good idea because full employment and a high gross domestic product number, perhaps at 5 percent, would be beneficial for commodities, he said. Second-quarter economic growth numbers are due out Friday. Economists expect an expansion of 3.8 percent, while CNBC\u2019s Rapid Update tracker projects GDP to rise 4.2 percent in the quarter. When it comes to U.S. stocks, Paulsen would diversify his sector exposure and buy inflationary beneficiaries like industrials, energy and materials. 'The trade for the year' For Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the focus should be off of momentum players. \u201cThe trade for the year is don\u2019t chase too much momentum. If things have worked too strongly, back off. And then look at areas that have not done as well,\u201d he told \"Power Lunch.\" Right now, the market is doing great because of corporate earnings, Slimmon said. But it will be a tougher time come August, when earnings are over and the market is only facing geopolitical headwinds, he added. Slimmon specifically likes financials, which have lagged but he thinks can do better.

San Francisco-based asset manager Bitwise is joining the race to launch a regulated ETF for cryptocurrency, which if approved could help struggling bitcoin prices. The company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday for an exchange traded fund that would track an a basket of 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. \"The index's goal is to capture the most valuable assets that emerge,\" Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC on \"Fast Money\" on Monday. \"A lot of people think of it as an S&P 500 for crypto.\" The U.S. financial watchdog has yet to approve a cryptocurrency-based ETF. Rumors that it could say yes to another application filed by money manager VanEck and SolidX as soon as August helped bitcoin break above the $8,000 mark this week. \u201cWe\u2019re joining the queue,\u201d Matt Hougan, Bitwise global head of research told CNBC. \u201cThe market is professionalizing in a direction that the SEC would allow a crytpo ETF onto the market.\u201d Horsley said he doesn't think the SEC will be in a rush to approve a digital coin-based ETF, but said he is excited to talk to regulators about what his firm has to offer. \"I think [the SEC is] being cautious. That's their job and that's what we would hope they would do,\" he said and added that the \"SEC, over the last two years, has demonstrated a great understanding of the [digital coin] space.\" Exchange-traded funds usually track an index or group of assets but trade like stocks. While other companies, including VanEck, SolidX and Gemini, have filed for bitcoin-only ETFs, Bitwise is the first and only to apply for one that would track multiple digital assets. In 2017, the SEC rejected an application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of crypto exchange Gemini. After VanEck and SolidX had their applications rejected, the two companies joined forces to file another version in June for an ETF to be called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares. That version is under review, and rumors of its approval have added to investor optimism and bitcoin's 20 percent rebound this week. Bitwise launched the the first crypto index fund in November, which is not registered with the SEC. That index is technically a private placement vehicle, which excludes retail investors and is meant for accredited investors with at least $1 million in liquid assets. \"Our clients like the index strategy,\" Horsley said. \"Many of them have an investment view that's not specific to one coin. They think something promising could come out of public blockchains. A cryptocurrency may emerge and be really valuable.\" The SEC and other regulators have been hesitant to approve bitcoin ETFs, mostly for security concerns. The agency has cracked down on cryptocurrency-related fraud in the past year, with a series of investor bulletins, stock trading suspensions and initial coin offering halts. \u2014 CNBC's Kellie Ell contributed to this report.

Here\u2019s why 6:19 PM ET Fri, 20 July 2018 | 02:05 President Donald Trump is worried the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates two more times this year, a White House official told CNBC. Aides to the president, however, are telling Trump the central bank is conducting policy properly. Their message from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is \"the Fed is doing it right, let it happen. The sooner it happens, the sooner it will be over,\" said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The central bank already has approved two increases this year. In June, officials indicated in their individual economic projections that there were two more increases in store before the end of 2018, likely in September and December. Aides told Trump that they believe the Fed will stop when its target rate is around 2.5 percent. That would be well below the 3.4 percent that the Fed currently has indicated, according to projections issued in June. The current rate is targeted between 1.75 percent and 2 percent and sits at 1.91 percent. Trump this week criticized the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for the increases adopted in March and June, saying that tightening monetary policy is threatening to thwart the economic recovery. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said he was \"not thrilled\" that the Fed was raising rates and thus causing upward pressure on the dollar. In a tweet Friday morning, the president added that \"tightening now hurts all that we have done.\" The fed funds futures market, where traders bet on the Fed's moves in the months ahead, is indicating an 89 percent chance of a rate hike in September and a 63 percent chance of a December move. An aide told CNBC that Trump understands that the Fed is independent and that he is merely expressing an opinion. The aide said Trump is being told by his confidantes that the central bank is moving properly and that it would be best to let monetary policy play out. \"He's not putting any pressure on them,\" the aide said, adding that the president realizes that Powell and several others are his appointees. \"They're all his guys. It's his board.\" Currency markets, however, reacted sharply to the president's Fed criticism. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of its global peers, fell 0.8 percent, on track for the worst performance in July. Longer-dated government bond yields rose on the day, with the 30-year bond crossing 3 percent for the first time since June 26. Response on the short end of the curve was more muted, with the 3-month bill down slightly and the 2-year yield rising modestly. With reporting by Eamon Javers.

Bitcoin broke the $8,200 level for the first time in two months Tuesday following weeks of bearish sentiment and a lack of new buyers. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency surged as high as $8,342.62, and rose more than 7 percent in the last 24 hours, according to industry website CoinDesk, which tracks a number of exchanges. The last time bitcoin traded above that key level was May 23. The digital currency is up roughly 15 percent in the past week, mostly buoyed by reports of institutional investor interest. \"The trajectory of the bitcoin narrative has inflected,\" said Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors. \"We see potential for inflows of fiat into crypto which supports higher prices.\" Last week, BlackRock confirmed it assembled a working group to look into cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology, blockchain. The working group has existed since 2015, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC, but the news still managed to help sentiment for the digital currency. Billionaire hedge fund manager Steven Cohen\u2019s venture arm, Cohen Private Ventures, invested in the cryptocurrency-focused fund Autonomous Partners, according to a Fortune report published last week. Speculation that a bitcoin ETF will be approved by the SEC in August has also boosted sentiment in the past month. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":470,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-tiSOz\"),window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"tiSOz\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"tiSOz\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); In addition, investors are eyeing global regulatory news.

Financial regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have become increasingly wary of ICOs. In an ICO, a start-up sells new digital tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum \u2014 or cash \u2014 to kickstart their business. The phenomenon has been marred by various scams and failed projects, leading to concerns that investors are being defrauded. China and South Korea banned the practice last year.

Fintech company Square is boosting its small-business lending with an eBay partnership. Square Capital, the lending arm of the payment start-up, will be available to eBay sellers looking to expand their business operations. Starting in the third quarter, merchants on the site can apply for a loan as small as $500 and up to $100,000 to help with everything from payroll and inventory to equipment and marketing, the companies announced Tuesday. Square Capital\u2019s focus since launching in 2014 has been on those businesses historically excluded from the larger financial system. The partnership will offer access to capital for those who have been \u201cunderserved when seeking funding\u201d and give U.S. sellers a \"seamless funding experience,\" said Jacqueline Reses, head of Square Capital. Small-business lending is an increasingly competitive area in fintech. PayPal, which was once a part of eBay, has a program called Working Capital and provides loans to merchants based on sales history. Amazon also does this for sellers, and began extending credit to small business owners in 2011. It uses sales data to trigger invitations for financing that could boost growth. Still, credit availability continues to be an issue for smaller merchants. Heading into this year, small businesses reported stronger revenue growth and profitability but still struggled to get loans to pay operating expenses and wages, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2017 Small Business Credit Survey. As many as 70 percent of merchants didn't receive the funding they wanted last year, the report said. San Francisco-based Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is best known as a credit cards processor but also offers payment hardware. Its peer-to-peer Cash App is growing faster than PayPal\u2019s Venmo, according to a recent Nomura report. It began offering cryptocurrency trading on the Cash App late January. Square Capital originally provided loans to merchants already using its credit card processing services. Two years later, it expanded outside of the Square ecosystem through its partnerships program. Shares of Square have surged more than 170 percent this year, and are up more than 100 percent this year alone. The company's stock was down 1 percent in midday trading Tuesday. EBay's stock was flat.

The iconic food company announced Tuesday that, starting Sept. 1, PepsiCo would become the exclusive nonalcoholic beverage and snack partner across all Madison Square Garden Company properties. The deal upends a contract MSG held with Coca-Cola dating back to 1910. Scott Rothbort, founder and president of LakeView Asset Management, said the new partnership is more of a symbolic gain than a financial one for PepsiCo. \"I don't think it's really going to move the needle in terms of Pepsi's earnings,\" he said Tuesday on \"Closing Bell.\" Still, both brands closed higher on the news, PepsiCo at 0.31 percent up and Coca-Cola, which reports earnings on Wednesday, at 0.69 percent up. Rothbort said his firm \"avoid[s] Coca-Cola\" but that it holds Pepsi in its dividend portfolio. Rothbort pointed out that both brands have underperformed the S&P 500 in the last five years, but PepsiCo by far less. He said the company will continue to outperform Coca-Cola thanks to PepsiCo's wide range of products. Other brands that fall under the PepsiCo umbrella include Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Frito-Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, SunChips, and Lipton and Pure Leaf ice teas. The new Madison Square Garden contract means Pepsi will be served across all MSG properties, including Radio City Music Hall in New York and the Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, PepsiCo will become an official partner of MSG's sports and other franchises, including the New York Knicks and Rangers, and the Christmas Spectacular, which stars the Radio City Rockettes. Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi Co. soda machines stand in a shopping center parking lot in Jasper, Indiana. The deal will also further increase PepsiCo's brand exposure by renaming the eight-floor concourse after the company. But this isn't the first time Pepsi has replaced Coke. In 2015, PepsiCo signed a contract to partner with the National Basketball Association as the league's exclusive food and beverage sponsor, ending Coca-Cola's 28-year-old contract.

While we believe this well\u2010seasoned Fed understands exactly the tightrope it is walking, the risk of destructive action is not zero,\u201d he said. Loeb, a widely followed hedge fund industry figure, won big last year by placing a bullish market bet on President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda, including tax reform and deregulation, in addition to predicting \u201csynchronized global growth.\u201d His main hedge fund returned 18.1 percent in 2017, while many of his peers significantly underperformed the market. The fund gained 6.1 percent in 2017. Loeb's hedge fund Third Point Offshore is up 0.8 percent through the end of June this year compared with the S&P 500's 2.6 percent return in the same time period, according to the investor letter. From inception in December 1996 to June, the fund generated annual returns of 15.4 percent versus the market's 8.1 percent. He also shared three other risk factors to the stock market rally: 1. Escalating trade war: \u201cAt this point, we are not concerned about the impact on the economy from the current tariff tit\u2010for\u2010tat, but an out\u2010of\u2010control battle could inject fear and caution into markets.\u201d 2. A slowing economic growth rate: \u201cAny growth acceleration will be less strong than in 2017 and is likely to be concentrated in the US, an unfavorable comparison to the previous year that may encourage pessimism.\u201d 3. Rising inflation: \u201cIncreasing signs of inflation, given the tight labor market.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/06/102405052-larry-page.jpg?v=1532378858", "time": "2018-07-23T17:54:54-0400", "author": "David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell on Monday.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-after-hours-and.html", "title": "After-hours buzz:\u00a0GOOGL, WHR & more", "keywords": [{"term": "David Paul Morris", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Google", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Larry Page", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Google I/O Annual Developers Conference", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "San Francisco", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Alphabet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "extended-hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "its second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "11.75", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "9.59", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$32.66 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$32.17 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "58 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the 49 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "more than 8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "extended-hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "its second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3.20", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "3.69", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$5.14 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "5.29", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "TD Ameritrade", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "after-hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "its third quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "89 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the 80 cents", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Ameritrade", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$1.38 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$1.35 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Vitamin Shoppe", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "after-hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Sharon M.

On Tuesday, bitcoin jumped above $8,000 and is now up 20 percent in one week. While bitcoin is nowhere near its December highs of around $19,500, the cryptocurrency has steadily increased in the last few weeks alone. Bitcoin fell below $6,000 in June and left market watchers wondering if the coin had hit bottom. \"There were a lot of big sellers out there,\" Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, said Monday on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\" Those big sell-offs included sales ahead of tax season and the Mt.Gox hack. \"That appears to be over,\" Kelly said, calling the cryptomarket \"a very reflexive one,\" meaning, the more valuable it becomes, the more investors want it. Jack Guez | AFP | Getty Images Kelly explains a few other reasons why bitcoin is on a positive track. Bitcoin ETF In June, money management firm VanEck tried for a third time to form a bitcoin exchange fund. The firm is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission. If the ETF is approved, crypto traders are optimistic that it will send bitcoin's price higher. Kelly said the chances of approval are slim. \"But that doesn't stop speculation on that,\" Kelly said, adding that the increased attention is helping bolster bitcoin's value. Other recent positive news includes Coinbase's potential $20 billion hedge fun for its custody service. Institutional Interest Institutions and large banks are starting to get serious about cryptocurrency, Kelly said. \"I can tell you from the calls that I'm getting, people that looked at [bitcoin] in December and didn't like the price are coming back now and saying, 'Alright, this thing is not going away. We need to understand what it is. Where does this asset class fit in to our portfolio?'\" Kelly said. \"Web 3.0\" The internet is evolving in what Kelly said is \"Web 3.0.\" \"We\u2019re moving from a database to a databank,\" he said. \"What does that mean?

The Gluskin Sheff chief economist and strategist expects widening spreads will tear it apart. \"The corporate bond market is today\u2019s bubble, just like the mortgage market a decade ago was the bubble back then,\" he said Monday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" Rosenberg, who referred to the corporate bond market as the \"elephant in the room,\" suggested that it's just a matter of time until it blows up and puts stocks at risk. \u201cSomething tells me in the next six months that we\u2019re going to have a dramatic widening in credit spreads,\" said Rosenberg. \"I know what happens in the tail end of every Fed tightening cycle.\" A credit spread is the difference in yield between a corporate bond and its Treasury equivalent. If they are widening, bond investors believe corporate balance sheets are getting riskier and want more in return for that risk compared with a government bond. Rosenberg has been known as a perma-bear for most of his career. However, he became one of the first Wall Street strategists to become bullish as the United States was digging itself out of the 2008 financial crisis. \"You always know that the bubble that was created by the previous mass of monetary accommodation comes out of the wash. This time around I\u2019m not even saying it\u2019s the equity market, per say. It\u2019s probably more in the corporate bond market,\" he said. According to Rosenberg, the United States is on the final leg of an economic expansion \u2014 a view he's held for a couple of years. But now, the end game may be closing in on investors. \"Liquidity [is] always your best friend in a bull market. Before you know it, in a bear market it runs away scared,\" Rosenberg said. \"That\u2019s the one thing you have to keep in the back of your mind.

And now analysts and investors are noticing Alphabet\u2019s investments in emerging disparate businesses are starting to bear fruit \u2014 including YouTube, autonomous cars and cloud computing \u2014 drawing comparison to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s success. The internet giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Monday, driving Alphabet shares to a new all-time high the following day. It generated adjusted earnings per share of $11.75 versus the Wall Street consensus of $9.59 for the quarter. Alphabet also posted a $1.06 billion gain in its equity investments for the time period. \u201cOur investments are driving great experiences for users, strong results for advertisers, and new business opportunities for Google and Alphabet,\" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google in the earnings press release Monday. As a result one well-known investor believes Alphabet has a shot of being the Berkshire Hathaway of tomorrow. \u201cWhat I'm really talking about is the diversified nature of what [Alphabet is] building away from the ad platform, in much the same way as Berkshire reinvested the float from insurance premiums into other investments. I guess I am also talking in terms of longevity, not just size,\u201d Josh Brown said in an email Tuesday. \u201cThis quarter witnessed a host of Google's other investments throwing off profits. Larry and Sergey were very open about their intention to create something Berkshire-like when they first announced the new structure and Alphabet.\u201d Brown is CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, a New York City-based investment advisory firm. He is also a CNBC contributor. Warren Buffett spent the last five decades building Berkshire Hathaway into a massive holding company for various businesses ranging from insurance and railroads to machine tools and ice cream. Along with his dozens of operating subsidiaries, Buffett manages a stock portfolio of more than $170 billion. In 2014 Larry Page told the FT if there is a person who has the qualities that he wanted to lead Google into the future, it was Warren Buffett. In the following year, Google restructured itself, moving the brand under the new Alphabet umbrella. Similar to Buffett\u2019s management structure, Page explained his role as capital allocator and executive manager. \u201cFundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren\u2019t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence,\u201d Page wrote about the changes. \u201cWe will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we\u2019ll determine their compensation.\u201d A few years later Alphabet is already the most active corporate venture capital investor out there. It invested in 103 deals last year, according Crunchbase data. And Wall Street is enthusiastic over the large growth opportunities from Alphabet\u2019s previous technology bets. KeyBanc Capital Markets reiterated its overweight rating for the stock, predicting Alphabet\u2019s investments will generate strong returns. \u201cAlphabet currently has a unique combination of strong positioning and extremely large addressable markets in ad-supported video, hardware, cloud, self-driving cars, and healthcare,\u201d analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a note to clients Monday. \u201cOver time, we believe each of these categories can develop into very large businesses for the Company, which should help sustain a pace of overall revenue growth that exceeds current consensus expectations and drives meaningful incremental profits.\u201d Hargreaves raised his price target to $1,430 from $1,230 for Alphabet shares, representing 18 percent upside from Monday's close. Even the Oracle of Omaha himself is a fan of the company, which may signal Alphabet is an heir apparent to the Berkshire throne. In May, Warren Buffett said he made a mistake by not investing in Google-parent Alphabet. \"I made the wrong decisions on Google and Amazon,\" he said at the Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual shareholder meeting on May 5. \"We've looked at it. I made the mistake in not being able to come to a conclusion where I really felt that at the present prices that the prospects were far better than the prices indicated.\" Disclaimer "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/07/104994070-GettyImages-915168890.jpg?v=1532464163", "time": "2018-07-25T08:31:07-0400", "author": "Paul Yang | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "The Bleakley Advisory Group's Peter Boockvar sees \"early tremors\" in the global bond market.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/24/rising-rates-likely-to-shake-stocks-to-core-peter-boockvar-warns.html", "title": "Rising rates likely to shake stocks to core, veteran investor Peter Boockvar warns", "keywords": [{"term": "3:19 PM ET Tue", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "24", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "02:31 Veteran", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Peter Boockvar", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "the Bleakley Advisory Group", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "10-Year", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2.95 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "about 31 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the past 52 weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "three-month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "more than a decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Japanese", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "earlier this week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "accelerating.\u2019", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "$4 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "ECB", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "1 month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Bill", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Vote Vote", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a Scientific Survey", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "100%", "category": "PERCENT"}], "body": " show chapters Rising rates could deliver crushing blow to stocks, Wall Street bear warns 3:19 PM ET Tue, 24 July 2018 | 02:31 Veteran investor Peter Boockvar doesn't find stocks tempting right now. Despite strong second quarter earnings reports, the Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer sees trouble brewing as central banks around the world abandon their post-financial crisis easy money policies and drive interest rates higher. He calls it the biggest risk to the stock market. \"They\u2019re all in this bed together in terms of global bonds and interest rates. So, what happens over there is going to have a ripple effect over here,\" Bookvar said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"I think we\u2019re beginning to see the early tremors.\" His thoughts came as the closely watched 10-Year-Treasury yield closed at 2.95 percent, up about 31 percent over the past 52 weeks. Plus, the three-month Treasury bill's yield surpassed 2 percent for the first time in more than a decade. Tuesday's moves in the U.S. came on the back of a sharp move higher in Japanese government bond yields earlier this week. \"Unfortunately, we may be facing a rise in global interest rates. That\u2019s not because \u2018oh, the global economy is great and accelerating.\u2019 It\u2019s more so a change in monetary policy,\" Boockvar said. \"These central banks [are] trying to get out of their extraordinary accommodation.\" Boockvar, a CNBC contributor who manages $4 billion for high net worth clients, believes there's a considerable risk that central banks could spark a contagion because of higher rates. It could manifest itself as a powerful blow because the U.S. and global economies have become \"very addicted to very low interest rates.\" But he isn't sure how soon a painful rising rate scenario could materialize and potentially crush stocks. \"It\u2019s tough to say. But in the back half of this year when the Fed further steps up tightening along with the ECB, I think people should be more on notice,\" he said. Boockvar is looking to one particular asset class that could provide some safety: old-fashioned cash. \"For traders and those with a short-term time horizon with cash needs, cash now pays you.

Alphabet \u201cis my biggest position,\" Cooperman said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\" The company's \"growth is very impressive relative to the valuation. ... It is very reasonably priced. Fortress balance sheet, dominant industry position, growing very rapidly.\" The investor said Alphabet represented about a 5 to 6 percent position size in his fund. He noted the company was trading at 21 times his firm's earnings estimate going into its quarterly report Monday. Alphabet shares surged to an all-time high Tuesday, a day after the internet giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Monday. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $11.75 versus the Wall Street consensus of $9.59 for the quarter. On the flip side, Cooperman shared how his fund sold its position in Apple way too early. Apple shares closed at $191.61 Monday. \"We blew it. We sold our Apple near $100,\" he said. \"We were concerned it was more of a hardware play than the software play it is turning out to be. It's a great company. We just blew it. We just got out prematurely.\" On Monday Cooperman revealed he is returning outside investor capital at year-end and converting Omega into a family office. \"I turned 75 last April. It is my understanding that if you make it past 65 and cancer doesn\u2019t get you, you can expect to live on average to 85. Hopefully, I can improve on that average, but in any event I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life chasing the S&P 500 and focused on generating returns on investor capital,\" Cooperman said in the note to clients Monday. Cooperman's main fund has generated annualized returns of 12.4 percent since inception versus the S&P 500's 9.5 percent return including reinvested dividends, according to Institutional Investor. Omega agreed last year to a $4.9 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after allegations of insider trading. Omega Advisors admitted to no wrongdoing. Investors redeemed $4 billion in capital during the SEC investigation, according to Institutional Investor. Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. It had approximately $3.6 billion in assets under management as of June 30. The investor has a net worth of $3.2 billion, according to Forbes.

celebrate the company's IPO on October 16, 2013 in New York City. Small-cap stocks have been the place to be invested in this year relative to the large-cap names, and two investors seem to have cracked the code on them. Amy Zhang of Alger and Sandy Villere of Villere & Co. are portfolio managers invested in small-cap stocks that have outperformed their peers. The Alger Small Cap Focus Fund Class A (AOFAX) has returned nearly 31 percent to investors and ranks in the first percentile of the \u201csmall growth\u201d category, according to data from Morningstar. Meanwhile, the Villere Balanced Fund (VILLX) has posted a return of 12.9 percent this year and ranks in the first percentile among balanced funds with 70-to-85 percent equity allocation. Their portfolios\u2019 strong performances come as small caps have thoroughly outperformed the large-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 index is up about 11 percent this year and hit a record high on July 10 while the S&P 500 is up just under 5 percent in 2018. However, not many people think of investing in the smaller stocks since they are not as popular and are not talked about nearly as much as the larger companies. Small caps also tend to be more volatile than large-cap stocks given their size. CNBC talked to Zhang and Villere about how they pick stocks and their investment process. Zhang said she tries to find companies \u201cthat have a competitive advantage over their peers,\u201d can disrupt industries \u201cbut are also sustainable,\u201d and have strong financials. One example of such a company is Guidewire Software, a company that makes software for insurance companies, Zhang said. Guidewire can benefit as the insurance industry is in the \u201cearly phase of reducing costs and improving revenue by replacing antiquated [information technology] infrastructure. The addressable market is very large, close to $8 billion, with very low penetration today,\u201d she said. Guidewire also generates lots of cash and invests heavily on research and development \u201cto stay at the cutting edge of innovation.\u201d Shares of Guidewire are up more than 25 percent this year. Zhang also highlighted Veeva Systems, a cloud-computing company that caters to pharmaceuticals, noting it \u201cexemplifies what we look for in a company.\u201d She said the company has a wide moat, or competitive advantage, and 20 percent annual revenue growth. Veeva shares are up more than 50 percent in 2018 and Zhang said the stock has more room to run. \u201cThe addressable market is very large, close to $8 billion, with very low penetration today,\u201d she said. Guidewire and Veeva are two of the largest holdings in Zhang\u2019s fund, with respective portfolio weights of 3.78 percent and 2.56 percent, Morningstar data shows. Zhang has managed the AOFAX fund since February 2015. The four-star rated fund has $1.6 billion in assets under management and has returned nearly 19 percent over the past three years. The fund is also in the fourth percentile in its category over that time period. Searching for hidden gems Villere of Villere & Co. said he looks for stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are lower than their growth rate. But to find such companies, Villere says he hunts for stocks that are not widely covered by Wall Street. \u201cTo invest in these great businesses, \u2026 we need to find these companies when they are younger and therefore smaller so that Wall Street hasn\u2019t yet discovered them,\u201d he said. One such company is Ebix, a firm that supplies software services to insurance and financial companies. \"We anticipate over time as the company continues to perform, larger bulge bracket firms will discover the company and write on them. The increased visibility can result in more investors discovering them which can lead to higher valuations,\" Villere said. Villere also said he tries to find companies with attractive valuations relative to their peers. An example is Cypress Semiconductor, a chipmaker that makes supplies for the several \"internet of things\" products, including the Amazon Echo. The stock is up more than 12 percent year to date and has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 14, below an average multiple of 19 for its peers, Villere said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap as dirt,\u201d Villere said. \u201cWe only own 23 stocks in our portfolio, so we\u2019re always looking for those pockets of cheap stocks.\u201d Villere also likes 3D Systems, a 3D printing company. While the company sells 3D printers at a low margin, \u201cthey just gobble up the materials and sell them at a really high margin,\u201d he said. The company also supplies Align Technology, the company responsible for creating Invisalign, a clear teeth aligner. \u201cWithout this company, Align Technology would not exist,\u201d said Villere. Shares of 3D Systems are up nearly 80 percent year to date. Villere has managed the Villere Balanced Fund since September 1999. The fund has a three-star rating at Morningstar and has $296.9 million in assets under management. Over the past 10 years, the fund has returned nearly 10 percent to investors and ranks in the first percentile of among balanced funds with 70-to-85 percent equity allocation, according to Morningstar. Small-cap stocks have benefited this year from more favorable valuations compared to large caps, lower taxes and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and some of the largest economies in the world. \u201cIt seems like everything is working in favor of small caps,\u201d said Villere. \u201cEven the trade war fears seem to be working in their favor.\u201d Small caps have lower overseas revenue exposure than large-cap companies, which typically do lots of business outside of the U.S. Zhang of Alger said small caps have more room to run, as they are still below their historical enterprise value to sales ratio. She also said: \u201cI do think it\u2019s small caps turn because they have historically outperformed the large caps, but in recent years they have lagged.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/07/28/104616086-GettyImages-679278604.jpg?v=1501214744", "time": "2018-07-24T11:52:04-0400", "author": "Justin Tallis | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "European markets closed higher on Tuesday, bouncing back from the weak sentiment seen in the previous session.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/24/european-markets-earnings-season-remains-in-focus.html", "title": "European stocks close higher on earnings, Peugeot soars 14.9%", "keywords": [{"term": " European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CAC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "600", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "0.86 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "five-week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4.78 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "November 2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2.59 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump is", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "European Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "EU", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "the United States", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Google-parent Alphabet", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "PSA Peugeot", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "around the summer of 2008", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "14.88 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "UBS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "4.32 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "9 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1.28 billion Swiss francs", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$1.29 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "a year ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Spectris", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "first-half", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "\u00a3728 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the second half", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Spectris", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "9.269 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "State Council", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Vote Vote", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "a Scientific Survey", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "100%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "July", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "IHS Markit", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "54.3", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "54.9", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "November of 2016", "category": "DATE"}], "body": " European markets closed higher on Tuesday, bouncing back from the weak sentiment seen in the previous session.

Microsoft and Facebook have both risen more than 20 percent while Alphabet and Apple have jumped 19.8 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Rosenberg said such concentration in the stock market has not been seen since the late 1990s, just before the dot-com bubble burst. \u201cWe know from history how these cycles typically end.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/13/105130485-GettyImages-846592706.jpg?v=1532533597", "time": "2018-07-25T12:55:41-0400", "author": "Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "Sens.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on Wednesday introduced a bill that would essentially wipe out tens of billions of dollars of Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in outstanding debt. The proposal, entitled the \u201cU.S. Territorial Relief Act of 2018,\u201d counts Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California as co-sponsors. The bill \u201cprovides an avenue to comprehensive debt relief for Puerto Rico and other hurricane-ravaged U.S. territories so that they have a chance to get back on their feet,\u201d according to the sponsors. \"Greedy Wall Street vulture funds must not be allowed to reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the Puerto Rican people for a second longer. It is time to end Wall Street's stranglehold on Puerto Rico's future, return control of the island to the people of Puerto Rico and give the territory the debt relief it so desperately needs to rebuild with dignity,\" said Sanders, I-Vt. \"Puerto Rico was already being squeezed before Hurricane Maria hit and will now have to rebuild under the weight of crushing debt. Our bill will give territories that have suffered an extraordinary crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet,\" said Warren, D-Mass. \"Disaster funding and the other resources in struggling territories' budgets must not go to Wall Street vulture funds who snapped up their debt. Congress should pass this legislation right away \u2014 our fellow U.S. citizens are counting on us.\" The legislation would give Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the choice to terminate nonpension debt loads if they meet \u201ccertain stringent criteria,\u201d according to the bill. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., is planning to introduce a companion bill in the House in September. \"After Maria, Puerto Rico needs every tool possible to recover physically and economically. This legislation provides another path for the Island to get back on its feet and begin the journey toward a brighter future,\u201d she said in a statement. A U.S. territory would have to meet two of three criteria in order to qualify for the debt relief: be the recipient of major federal disaster assistance, have a population decline of 5 percent over 10 years or have per-capita debt exceeding $15,000. Puerto Rico would almost certainly meet these requirements if the bill were to be signed into law. The bankrupt island's outstanding bond indebtedness is roughly $73 billion, or nearly $17,000 debt per capita, before Hurricane Maria struck the island in September. The Commonwealth has also projected a cumulative decline in population of 19.4 percent by 2022, according to the island\u2019s fiscal plan. If Puerto Rico chooses to terminate its debt within three years of the bill being signed into law, $15 billion in federal funds would become available to some of the island\u2019s residents and other creditors whose holdings were terminated. The Territorial Relief Act of 2018 would use a special master to oversee the $15 billion in the \u201cPuerto Rico Debt Restructuring Compensation Fund.\u201d Some $7.5 billion would be allocated for Puerto Rican creditors who held the terminated debt, including the island\u2019s residents, banks and credit unions that did business solely in Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s unions and public pension plans, businesses with a principal place of business on Puerto Rico, and anyone else the special master identifies. Another $7.5 billion would be allocated for creditors on the mainland U.S. who held the terminated debt, including individual investors, trade unions, pension plans, open-end mutual funds that pledge to waive the manager\u2019s fee for any compensation received, and anyone else the special master identifies, according to the bill. The bill would exclude \u201chedge funds and their investors, bond insurers, many financial firms with consolidated assets greater than $2 billion, and repo or swaps investors from the distribution,\u201d according to the summary of the legislation.

The company on Wednesday reported slightly lower-than-expected second-quarter sales and daily active user numbers. But the bigger disappointment was its guidance for slower sales growth for the third and fourth quarters and a dramatically reduced forecast for long-term profit margins. Chief financial officer David Wehner said the company's operating profit margin will fall to the \"mid-30s on a percentage basis\" over a more than two-year period, compared with second-quarter operating margin of 44 percent. Facebook shares plunged more than 20 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday after the guidance. The stock closed down 19 percent Thursday at $176.26. Nomura Instinet lowered its rating to neutral from buy for Facebook shares, citing management's weak sales and profit forecasts. \"Though management is likely being overly conservative, in our view, our model has taken on an entirely new revenue growth and margin profile than what we were looking for headed into the print,\" analyst Mark Kelley said in a note to clients Thursday. \"With stagnating core user growth, we think there is too much near- to mid-term uncertainty to recommend shares at this point.\" Kelley reduced his price target for Facebook shares to $183 from $228. In similar fashion, Raymond James lowered its rating to outperform from strong buy due to Facebook's lower profit margin guidance. \"Facebook guided mid/long-term operating margins to the mid-30s vs. our ~45% in 2018. Given the increased near-term uncertainty on revenue growth, slowing user growth, and lower margin forecast, we are downgrading our rating,\" analyst Aaron Kessler said in a note to client Thursday. Kessler reduced his price target for Facebook shares to $210 from $240. One analyst believes Facebook's other new product offerings will not be able to make up for the slowing growth rate of its core platform. \"After a pronounced selloff in response to mgmt comments about forward growth & margin trajectory, we now see the risk/reward as balanced for FB going forward,\" UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"In our opinion, the new growth drivers (Instagram, Watch, Stories, Messenger/WhatsApp, VR) frankly aren't big enough over the short/medium term to alter the decelerating growth & margin pressure profile of the P&L.\" Sheridan reduced his rating to neutral from buy for Facebook shares and lowered his price target to $180 from $212 for the company. Even after the downgrades, Facebook still has a whopping 28 buy ratings on Wall Street, three hold ratings and two sells, according to TipRanks.com. Here's a roundup of analyst comment on Facebook.

But the largest digital currency by market cap still isn't close to its December, 2017 high of $19,783.21. Now, market watchers are waiting in anticipation for the next jump \u2014 or decline. \"Any number of catalysts could send bitcoin exploding higher,\" Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC on \"Fast Money\" Wednesday. Those catalysts include global trade tensions, the possibility of a bitcoin ETF, rising currency rates and Mastercard's recent announcement of a new patent that could allow bitcoin transactions on credit cards. \"Bitcoin is kind of a tinderbox right now, waiting for reasons to go higher,\" said the venture capitalist. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images In May, even as bitcoin continued to fall, Bogart said it was the only digital coin worth buying, as more banks and large institutions were beginning to accept the coin, and urged long-term investors to get on board. Other cryptocurrencies, he said, were \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\" He said bitcoin, which was priced around $7,400 at the time, would likely go lower before hitting at least $10,000 by the end of 2018. The coin fell below $6,000 the following month.

Marc Levine, chairman of Illinois State Board of Investment \"During my career, there was a modest recession in the 90s that was based off of silly commercial real estate lending, and then we saw the big bubbles in the late 90s with dotcom and crazy valuations of tech stocks and of course the mortgage crisis,\" Levine said. \"I have to tell you, I just don't see these large, fundamental excesses [today].\" Christopher Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty Images Marc Levine, chairman of the Illinois State Board of Investment That's not to say he doesn't have concerns. \"I see some things that I don't love, like high yield and emerging market debt,\" Levine said. \"But again, those are really modest and they're not going to create these massive, massive problems like those mortgages and mortgage

PayPal falls on Q3 revenue guidance 8:28 PM ET Thu, 26 July 2018 | 00:40 PayPal reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, but its third-quarter revenue outlook fell short. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 57 cents, forecast by Thomson ReutersRevenue: $3.86 billion vs. $3.81 billion, forecast by Thomson Reuters That revenue figure represents 23 percent growth, from the $3.14 billion PayPal reported in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, PayPal's profit forecast was in line with analyst expectations, but its revenue outlook missed. The company said it expects adjusted earnings per share between 53 cents and 55 cents on revenue between $3.62 billion and $3.67 billion. Analysts had projected third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share on revenue of $3.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. Shares of PayPal fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trade. The stock has been on a tear, setting an fresh all-time intraday high of $92.35 in Wednesday's session. PayPal has gained 24 percent so far in 2018 and more than 56 percent in the past 12 months. For the second quarter, PayPal\u2019s net income climbed to $703 million, or 58 cents per share, from $554 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. PayPal also said its board approved up to $10 billion in share buybacks. The financial technology company also raised its full-year forecast, saying it now expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.32 and $2.35 on revenue between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. PayPal previously projected adjusted full-year earnings per share between $2.31 and $2.34 on revenue between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion. On Monday, Third Point hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb revealed that his fund added a new position in PayPal during the second quarter. He forecasts that the stock price will rise to $125 within 18 months, representing a 43 percent upside to Friday's close. \"We see parallels between PayPal and other best\u2010in\u2010class internet platforms like Netflix and Amazon: high and rising market share, untapped pricing power, and significant margin expansion potential,\" Loeb said in a letter to clients. When reached for comment, a PayPal spokesperson said the company appreciates the investment. In May, PayPal unveiled a $2.2 billion deal to buy European payments start-up iZettle ahead of its IPO. The Sweden-based company had planned on listing on the Nasdaq in Stockholm prior to the announcement.

Of 848 hedge funds tracked by Goldman Sachs, 97 had Facebook as a top 10 holding, according to the firm's May \"Hedge Fund Trend Monitor\" report. The note, tracking $1.6 trillion in hedge fund long positions, used the latest available filings for the first quarter. The report ranked Facebook as the No. 1 most-held stock in the top 10 positions among those hedge funds, followed by Amazon at 74 funds. The cumulative hedge-fund stake comprised 5 percent of Facebook's equity shares outstanding, according to the report. As the shares dropped 19 percent Thursday more than $119 billion in market cap vanished. Five percent of the stock value drop is a nearly $6 billion loss in total for the hedge-fund managers. The historic plunge in the \"FANG\" stock comes after company executives reported Wednesday that Facebook missed both revenue and global daily active user expectations after struggling to cope with data leaks and fake news scandals. On a call with analysts, Facebook said it expects its revenue growth rates to be lower than the year prior in the second half of this year. Facebook investors have been plagued by a string of data privacy concerns and policy shifts since the Cambridge Analytica data scandal broke in March. Facebook admitted that data from as many as 87 million of its users may have been wrongly shared with the British political consulting firm, which aided President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The resulting scandal sparked concern about Facebook's broader oversight of its platform, an FTC probe into whether the company breached a 2012 settlement under which it's required to give the social network's users notice and obtain consent before sharing their information as well as two appearances by Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill in April. Prior to the dramatic reset, Facebook's stock proved to a reliable option for traders looking for exposure to a burgeoning technology industry and steady advertising revenue projections. Its stock rallied 53 percent in 2017, easily besting the S&P 500's 19.4 percent gain over the year. The now-embattled stock is unchanged in 2018 versus a 6.2 percent gain for the S&P 500. To be sure, hedge funds may have sold down their position in Facebook in the months after the scandal. But it is likely it was still a top holding going into the earnings report as the shares hit an all-time high Wednesday.

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett Warren Buffett praised Leon Cooperman\u2019s vow to give away his entire fortune to charity. In an email to the hedge fund billionaire, Buffett said \u201ca disproportionately low number of people\u201d from Wall Street have committed to the Giving Pledge, and he urged the 75-year-old Cooperman to influence his peers to give more. The Giving Pledge was created by Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2010, 40 of America\u2019s wealthiest individuals and couples committed to give more than half of their wealth away to philanthropy or charitable causes. Cooperman expressed his commitment to the pledge Tuesday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\" \u201cI think Warren Buffett has said this publicly. When I took the Giving Pledge I told him asking for half is not asking for enough. I intend to give it all away. And I\u2019m going to give it to those organizations, institutions and individuals that made a difference to me in my lifetime. That\u2019s my focus,\u201d Cooperman said. Here is the full email Buffett sent to Cooperman following his CNBC appearance Tuesday: Hi Lee,You were terrific on CNBC today. I think I know exactly the emotions you experienced and the reasoning you followed since I had done somewhat the same thing in 1969.The one thing I can guarantee you is that your parents would be extraordinarily pleased at the course you have followed \u2014 and are going to continue to follow in life.Example can be powerful. At The Giving Pledge, we have a disproportionately low number of people who have made their fortunes in Wall Street. You can be a powerful influence in having them rethink their priorities. I hope you make use of the moral podium on which you stand.I agree with you that I didn\u2019t ask for enough when I called on you to pledge 50% -- and I\u2019m glad you are correcting for my error.Best regards,Warren Scott Mlyn | CNBC Leon Cooperman A day before his pledge, Cooperman revealed he is returning outside investor capital at year-end and converting his Omega Advisors into a family office. Cooperman founded Omega in 1991. It had approximately $3.6 billion in assets under management as of June 30.

The social media giant's market capitalization plummeted by $119 billion to $510 billion as its stock price plummeted by 19 percent. At Wednesday's close, Facebook's market cap had totaled nearly $630 billion, according to FactSet. No company in the history of the U.S. stock market has ever lost $100 billion in market value in just one day, but two came close. On Sept. 22, 2000, Intel shed $90.74 billion in market value as the dot-com bubble burst. Earlier that year, Microsoft lost $80 billion from its market cap in one day. Other companies that have experienced similar one-day losses in dollar amount include Apple in 2013, when it lost $59.6 billion, and Exxon Mobil in 2008, when it lost $52.5 billion. Facebook's enormous loss in value came a day after the company reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter as well as disappointing global daily active users, a key metric for Facebook. The company also said it expects its revenue growth rate to slow in the second half of this year. Several analysts downgraded Facebook's stock, including Nomura Instinet's Mark Kelley. \"With stagnating core user growth, we think there is too much near- to mid-term uncertainty to recommend shares at this point,\" Kelley, who downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, said in a note.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive officer of Qualcomm Inc., holds the new Snapdragon 835 chip during a keynote at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Qualcomm has formally terminated its proposed acquisition of chip rival NXP, ending a two-year courtship and paving the way for a $30 billion stock buyback, the company said Thursday morning. \u201cOur core strategy of driving Qualcomm technologies into higher growth industries remains unchanged,\" CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a statement. Shares of Qualcomm rose 5 percent in premarket trading Thursday. Shares of NXP were down about 8 percent. Qualcomm announced its intention to walk away Wednesday night when the company reported third-quarter earnings, but there was still a chance China's State Administration for Market Regulation, or SAMR, could make a last minute announcement to approve the merger before 11:59 pm ET. CNBC earlier reported Qualcomm understood the likelihood of that ninth and final regulatory approval to be very slim, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the company's discussions are private. The expiration of the self-imposed deadline between Qualcomm and NXP leaves Qualcomm on the hook for a $2 billion breakup fee. Qualcomm first offered to buy NXP, which is based in the Netherlands, for about $38 billion in October 2016, but faced resistance from some NXP shareholders, who were holding out for a better price. Qualcomm upped its bid to $44 billion in February, but the deal has been held up by Chinese regulators amidst a growing trade conflict between the U.S. and China centered around the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on some Chinese manufactured goods. The buyout could have helped Qualcomm, which provides chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple, expand into new market areas like automotive chips. Earlier this year, Broadcom's attempt to buy Qualcomm was blocked by the Trump administration over national security concerns. \u2014CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report. show chapters Deadline approaches for NXP-Qualcomm deal 3:14 PM ET Wed, 25 July 2018 | 02:10 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/25/105352262-1532532069484gettyimages-945142020.jpeg?v=1532532140", "time": "2018-07-25T13:04:10-0400", "author": "Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "Amid continuing trade tensions,\u00a0WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo responds to Trump advisor Larry Kudlow's remarks by saying, \"The WTO is not broken.\"", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/wto-is-not-broken-says-wtodirector-general-roberto-azevedo.html", "title": "'WTO is not broken,' says WTO\u00a0Director-General Roberto Azevedo", "keywords": [{"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Roberto Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "11:13 AM ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "25", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "06:20", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "World Trade Organization", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Roberto Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Larry Kudlow", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "morning", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Kudlow", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CBS This Morning", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "several decades", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2009", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Squawk on the Street", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "European Commission", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Washington", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "D.C.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "the 2.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "European", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Tuesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump went", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "The European Union", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Washington", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "tomorrow", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trade", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "E.U.", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Free Market", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "TWEET Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Fabrice Coffrini | AFP |", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Getty Images World Trade Organization", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Roberto Azevedo Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2016 to 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "around $49 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "about $85 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Trump's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "WTO", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Azevedo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}], "body": " show chapters WTO is not broken, says WTO Director Roberto Azevedo 11:13 AM ET Wed, 25 July 2018 | 06:20 As trade tensions heat up, World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo told CNBC, \"The WTO is not broken. The WTO is functioning actually quite well.\" Azevedo was responding to remarks by President Donald Trump's chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, who said Wednesday morning that the president's nontraditional ways of negotiating international affairs are not to blame for ongoing trade disputes. \"Don't blame President Trump; I've said this so often,\" Kudlow said on \"CBS This Morning.\" \"The world trading system is broken. The WTO is broken. There's no reciprocity left. China's the worst offender but not the only one around the world. Mr. Trump's trying to fix trading malpractice that goes back several decades.\" But while Azevedo said there is always room for improvement, he also said the WTO was instrumental in helping the global recovery after the 2009 financial crisis. \"We would have seen many more protectionist measures in place,\" Azevedo said, had it not been for the WTO. \"The global economy would have had a much harder time recovering,\" he said Wednesday on \"Squawk on the Street.\" Trump is scheduled to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. The meeting is an attempt to ease trade differences, specifically in the auto industry. Trump has said the 10 percent European tax on U.S. cars is too high compared with the 2.5 percent duty the U.S. applies to European vehicles. On Tuesday, Trump went on Twitter to say, \"The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won\u2019t!\" TWEET Trump has also said the tariffs are a measure to improve national security, something Azevedo called \"not orthodox.\" \"National security has been used before [to implement tariffs],\" he said, but he pointed out the current tariffs \"are very much different, because we are talking about specific trade areas that are more loosely defined.\" Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images World Trade Organization director-general Roberto Azevedo Azevedo said further discussions are needed to address issues such as China and what each country can contribute. In addition, he said the WTO is releasing its own trade report, which shows the growth of trade restrictive measures. From 2016 to 2017, the report shows that trade restrictive measures were around $49 billion, compared with about $85 billion from 2017 to 2018. \"We hope that we can stop this trend,\" Azevedo said. \"The growth of the global economy is showing signs of recovery. Our hope is that these new trade tensions will not affect that and will not take away the opportunities of this growth that is looking promising right now.\" As for Trump's repeated threats that the U.S. will withdraw from the WTO, Azevedo said it's \"absolute speculation.\" \"I had no indication whatsoever on the part of any of the authorities of the U.S. that I have talked to that this would be the case,\" he said.

Business executives and GOP members have said such a move could lead to political chaos and damage the economy, but Trump has told advisors to \"simply trust his business acumen,\" the Post reported. The president underlined his business-first message in a tweet Wednesday morning. \"Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking?\" he said. \"Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!\" The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The U.S. president is scheduled to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Wednesday afternoon to negotiate trade. The EU has already imposed $3.3 billion worth of tariffs on U.S. goods in response to an decision by Trump to impose a 25 and a 10 percent duty on steel and aluminum from Europe. Positive news from the Juncker meeting could be a much-needed boost for major U.S. automakers, which were trading mostly lower Wednesday. Shares of General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, fell more than 7 percent after cutting its profit outlook for the year, citing higher costs for raw materials. Steel and aluminum prices have risen since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on the two key raw materials for the car manufacturing. Rival Fiat Chrysler was down more than 11 percent after it also cut its outlook for the year, and shares of Ford, which reports after the market closes Wednesday, were down roughly 4 percent.

Dealing with the fallout from the president's tough trade tactics is dominating the conference calls company executives typically hold following the release of their earnings results. Tariffs have been mentioned in some form on more than 40 percent of the 146 S&P 500 companies that have already reported second-quarter earnings this season. In an effort to track corporate America's thoughts on the growing trade dispute, CNBC is amassing statements from earnings calls that involve discussion on the new taxes on foreign goods. The impact seems heavily tilted toward the industrials sector. New U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, for instance, appear to be sending shock waves throughout the economy with mixed effect. show chapters Whirlpool earnings miss, tariffs impact on results 3:29 PM ET Tue, 24 July 2018 | 03:21 Home appliance manufacturer Whirlpool, which once favored stricter trade controls for its own industry, saw its own shares plummet 14 percent Tuesday after executives blamed rising aluminum and steel costs for lackluster earnings. \"Global steel cost has risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels,\" Whirlpool chief executive Marc Bitzer told shareholders during the company\u2019s conference call. Most of the discussions are critical, but there are a few companies seeing benefits. Nucor, which produces and sells a variety of steel products in the United States and internationally, applauded the recent regulatory efforts. \u201cThe tariffs send a clear message that the U.S. is done asking nicely for compliance with the rules of trade,\u201d said Nucor Chairman and CEO John Ferriola. \u201cThe U.S. steel market is also benefiting from a reduction in unfairly traded imports entering our country as a result of years of successful trade cases, and the broad-based tariffs imposed on the Section 232. Imports are down more than 7 percent through the first half of 2018. With all tariffs going into effect in June, we expect this trend to continue.\u201d Below are some key quotes by company executives from major S&P 500 members about tariffs on these calls, according to FactSet transcripts. Harley-Davidson \"As a result of the recently enacted tariffs, we expect to incur approximately $45 million to $55 million of increased costs. This includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum, and approximately $30 million to $35 million for EU tariffs. We expect to absorb a significant portion of these incremental costs through disciplined business management. However, given the magnitude of these unplanned costs, we are adjusting our full year 2018 operating margin guidance.\" The Coca-Cola Company \"The price increase I just talked about on the last question is predominantly the price increase from the bottling system on the sparkling brands in particular, which faced a whole series of input costs: freight, yes; plastic resins, yes; metal in all its various forms for many reasons, including tariffs. So there is some broad-based push on input costs that have kind of come in and affected us and many other industries as well.\" Union Pacific \"The concern is that tariffs are just going to basically be a tax, whether it's on U.S. consumption or U.S. products going overseas. And generally, that's going to retard \u2014 that's going to reduce the amount of demand. We haven't necessarily seen that wholesale ... but it's pretty early. Those things just went into effect. We have seen some very specific impacts on us. But they're pretty granular, right? Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan, there was a substantial 25% tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers.\" Honeywell \"We have seen inflation accelerate in a number of areas within the business, most notably in transportation and logistics and in metals. And our procurement, marketing and commercial excellence teams are proactively working on offsets to minimize the impact to our P&L. Based on the tariffs enacted to-date and our mitigation actions across the portfolio, we anticipate a minimal impact to our overall business results in 2018. But this is a very dynamic situation that changes by the day, as further evidenced by this morning's headlines and we're giving it substantial focus.\" Whirlpool \"Since mid-May, a number of elements in the macro environment worsened significantly. In addition to continued raw material inflation, we experienced a temporary, but significant decline in U.S. industry demands, headwinds related to U.S. tariffs as well as the Brazilian trucker strike and currency fluctuations in Russia and Latin America. While these macro challenges impacted our results negatively, the actions we put in place over the past few quarters, including cost-based price increases and targeted cost reduction throughout the world, enabled us to largely offset these challenges.\" 3M \"First, the steel and aluminum under the National Security Act and that impact as well as the Section 301 List 1. Those two that have already been enacted we see having a fairly immaterial impact on us. We estimate that to be approximately $10 million, or $0.01 a share, on an annualized basis, the direct and indirect impact of those tariffs. We are actively monitoring and assessing the potential impact from Section 301 List 2 and List 3, if those were implemented and any potential retaliation that could occur with those. And we're prepared to act with sourcing changes, supply changes, and pricing changes if enacted.\" General Electric \"If you go and look at the actual tariffs, the $50 billion that are announced and implemented and $200 billion announced but not implemented yet, I'd say we look at it on a gross and a net basis. So it could be $300 million to $400 million at a gross level before any mitigating factors are taken there and there are some significant mitigating factors ... we are a company that's built for fair and open trade. That's obviously a subject of debate and discussion. I think that's what you're seeing right now. We're supportive of fair and open trade. We have a massively global business in every sense, both with the customers, supply chains, everything. And our view right now is we hope and we expect that ultimately these matters reach a sensible, negotiated conclusion.\" Nucor \"The U.S. steel market is also benefiting from a reduction in unfairly traded imports entering our country as a result of years of successful trade cases, and the broad-based tariffs imposed on the Section 232. Imports are down more than 7% through the first half of 2018. With all tariffs going into effect in June, we expect this trend to continue. The tariffs send a clear message that the U.S. is done asking nicely for compliance with the rules of trade and is serious about demanding changes in the trade practices of other countries.\" Hasbro \"We've been working with and talking to the administration and our congressional delegations to ensure we're communicating just how terrible an impact ongoing tariff or trade war would be. Thus far, we've only seen non-material changes to the tariff schemes of other countries that don't really impact our business. Our toy business has not been part of the 303 designation that is currently been put in place, but we continue to monitor the situation and we continue to talk and firmly believe in a free trade environment as the best course for our company and for the industry.\" CSX \"In terms of the specific impacts on CSX today, from any kind of tariff activity, clearly, first was steel. And from a steel standpoint, both finished steel out and ore business in, we have seen some positive as a result of the U.S. steel manufacturers kicking-off production.\" Comerica \"I do think that tariffs and trade-related issues, especially given the markets that we're in \u2014 Michigan, California and Texas \u2014 all who have some economic reliance on trade and some of the industry verticals that we operate in. Given that, I would say that is probably the primary concern that we're hearing from customers right now so that's I think factored into somewhat of our more moderate view on a go-forward basis. But I do want to emphasize that part of that moderate view as well is just the seasonality that we see especially in the third quarter in Middle Market.\" Prologis \"What we hear from our customers so far is that they're moving forward with their growth plans and we have yet to see any change in sentiment or decision making on the ground. We remain cautiously optimistic as the vast majority of our portfolio is located in large consumption markets including a significant focus on city distribution and Last Touch delivery. However, escalating trade tensions are a negative for the global economy and akin to attacks on consumers. If today's political rhetoric intensifies and translates into actual protectionist policies, it will be a negative for all businesses in the U.S. and abroad including ours.\" W.W. Grainger \"We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half, and we are confident in our ability to pass on price increases. I think it's helpful to point out that the current market dynamic is similar to past periods of inflation. Grainger has historically done well in managing cost and getting price realization through these periods.\" Kinder Morgan \"The steel tariffs are enough to make us spend some extra time to make sure we've got a clear supply chain that gets that pipe to us at a predictable price and on time. And so it has an effect. It's created uncertainty. There's no question about it. And so it's an uncertainty that we are actively managing and working on.\" Danaher \"We don't feel that we're in the crosshairs of what they're really going after, but \u2014 and in fact there is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of little impact across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of $0.01 a quarter impact.\" The Travelers Company \"Tariffs presumably would impact the inputs that go into loss costs as there are a lot of things by the way that impact the way we think about loss costs. I think on generally we would look at that as affecting short-term lines and things that we could react to. So we don't look at it and there's no sort of outsized expectations here but we're watching it.\" Dover \"Parsing that out is relatively difficult. We are keeping a close look at our exposure to China in terms of our revenue base, clearly. And not only our exposure from a revenue point of view, but also the mismatch between what we make in China and sell into China versus what we import/export. So we're running the traps on all of that.\" Genuine Parts \"We absolutely have had conversations with our suppliers. They're ongoing. We've got a team that's very involved with this. And we would be looking at any increases, whether it's raw materials, freight, interest rates, tariffs, we're looking at it very broadly. We've got teams in place that are working with our global sourcing offices. We've got modeling going on. We're going to use a lot of database negotiations with our suppliers. But at the end of the day, it's going to be something that we pass along to the customer.\" PPG Industries \"In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts. Currently, the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials. Based on the strength in the U.S. dollar in second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact to our sales in the third quarter. Based on current rates, the unfavorable impact is expected to be between $60 million to $80 million for the third quarter.\" Intuitive Surgical \"The tariff situation is, obviously, dynamic. The first round of tariffs that have been imposed do impact some of the components that our suppliers use to supply us. We're studying that as we speak. We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems. That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass any of those costs on to customers at this point in time.\" Cintas \"From a direct standpoint, we have certainly had some impact like hangers. But overall, it has not been significant. From an indirect standpoint \u2014 and when I say indirect, I mean from our vendors \u2014 it remains to be seen how they will be impacted and how that might in turn impact us. We're certainly keeping our eyes on that. But we need a little bit more time for that to play out. From a customer perspective, too early to see much of an impact.\" Stanley Black & Decker \"We currently estimate the impact of tariffs to be a 2018 headwind of approximately $35 million. This reflects the impact of Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as the initial $34 billion of Section 301 tariffs on componentry and some finished goods. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the formal exclusion process where applicable ... Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume, and it is an assumption, a September 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million.\" Illinois Tool Works \"As many of you know, our model is to source and produce where we sell. And this approach helps significantly mitigate the risk associated with tariffs. By our estimate, the impact of tariffs represent about 10% to 15% of our total projected cost inflation in 2018. In addition, only 2% of ITW's material spend is sourced from China. Our produce where we sell model and the very limited cross border movement of raw materials and products certainly helps mitigate the impact from tariffs.\" UTX \"There are some risks that we need to watch, particularly in terms of tariffs and their impact on product cost. Based on what has been enacted so far, again this is just the first round of tariffs, the near-term impact to UTC appears to be relatively modest. We'll say about $0.05 a share and that $0.05 is included in our revised EPS guidance.\" TE Connectivity \"For those products that are impacted, we're committed to working closely with our customers to minimize the impact and we are proactively looking at a combination of actions including further optimizing current supply chains, continuing to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and in some cases, implementing surcharges to customers. I would like to reiterate that, as a global company, TE is a proponent of free and open trade, tariffs and restricted trade policies create friction, uncertainty and added cost for businesses engaged in global markets.\" WATCH: Senators introduce bill to delay auto tariffs show chapters Senators introduce bipartisan bill to delay auto tariffs 3:26 PM ET Wed, 25 July 2018 | 01:09 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/01/105175109-RTS1PCEF.jpg?v=1531837183", "time": "2018-07-26T08:55:54-0400", "author": "Mike Blake | Reuters", "description": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells CNBC NAFTA negotiations \"are making a lot of progress.\"", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/mnuchin-hopes-to-have-agreement-on-nafta-very-soon.html", "title": "Mnuchin hopes to have a NAFTA agreement 'very soon'", "keywords": [{"term": "EU", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "9:59 AM ET Thu", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "26", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Treasury", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Steven Mnuchin", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "NAFTA", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Mnuchin", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Squawk Box", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Earlier this month", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mexico", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "a day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "European Union", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Mnuchin", "category": "ORG"}], "body": " show chapters Secretary Mnuchin: We'll turn EU trade talks into a 'real' agreement 9:59 AM ET Thu, 26 July 2018 | 15:17 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday a deal on NAFTA is coming in the near future. \"We hope to have an agreement in principle, clearly, very soon. That's the first priority,\" Mnuchin said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think we're making a lot of progress.\" The U.S., Mexico and Canada have been in talks to renegotiate the trade deal after President Donald Trump repeatedly bashed it by calling it the worst trade agreement ever.

But top negotiators for Canada and Mexico said Wednesday they were committed to a trilateral NAFTA agreement. Mnuchin spoke a day after Trump announced the U.S. and European Union would work together on lowering tariffs. \"I think you're going to see pieces of this roll out.

Crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital took a $134 million hit in the first quarter as bitcoin lost half its value and other cryptocurrencies struggled to break out of a bear market. In its first-ever financial disclosure released this week, the New York-based firm reported a net loss of $103.3 million on trading, with $13.5 million on digital assets and another $85.5 million of unrealized losses on those assets. Former Goldman Sachs macro trader Michael Novogratz launched the company in November, a month before bitcoin hit its high near $20,000. \"I am very proud of the progress that we have made since the beginning of the year,\" Galaxy CEO Novogratz said in a statement, which was published on a Canadian financial regulator's website. Despite the loss, Novogratz, who was formerly chief investment officer of Fortress Investment Group's macro fund, said he still has \"complete confidence\" in the team's ability to drive growth and that Galaxy is \"strategically positioned to help further institutionalize the digital assets and blockchain industry.\" As part of that growth, Novogratz outlined plans to list the merchant bank on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange. In order to list, Galaxy Digital will buy Canadian crypto startup Coin Capital, then merge through a reverse takeover with Canadian shell company Bradmer Pharmaceuticals, which it plans to rename. The company will have more than 70 employees as a result. Novogratz has long been bullish on bitcoin and blockchain, the technology that underpins it. So far this year, Galaxy Digital has invested $86.8 million across 11 different investments and six acquisitions. The company had $281.7 million in assets as of the end of March, with $225.8 million of that total digital, the release said. Novogratz contributed $302 million of his own assets to the company, according to the documents. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have yet to find price footing this year.

Its main product was viewed as addictive and nearly immune to competition, and investors complacently believed stellar long-term growth was almost inevitable. The company was Philip Morris, and April 2, 1993, became known as \"Marlboro Friday\" after it suddenly cut the price of its flagship cigarette brand by 20 percent, buckling to intense competition from generic smokes. At least in broad outlines, the situation resembles the situation of Facebook today: Investors were conditioned to believe that Facebook's hold on its users was something close to an addiction and immune to bad press about fake news and misuse of customer data. Its shares ran up 23 percent this year to a new high and a market value above $600 billion. Then came Wednesday night's mildly disappointing quarterly results and jarring forecast by management that spending would increase for quarters to come, profit margins will compress significantly and \u2014 perhaps \u2014 users in some regions were managing to kick their Facebook habit. The benefit of hindsight tells us that, for Philip Morris \u2014 now called Altria, after its split with Philip Morris International \u2014 \"Marlboro Friday\" was a painful, but temporary, shakeout. The company managed to preserve market share and, eventually, work through massive legal liabilities and sharp declines in developed-world smoking rates. The company regained pricing power, produced massive dividends for shareholders and has delivered excellent long-term share-price returns. However, Marlboro Friday also punctured investor confidence in other highly valued branded-consumer-goods companies, which in the '80s has gathered a reputation as can't-miss growth vehicles. Of course, there's no saying the Street's readjustment to Facebook's revised outlook will track Philip Morris' experience from here. That stock took a year and a half or so to recoup those one-day losses. Facebook shares dropped 19 percent on Thursday \u2014 but back to prices last seen just a few months ago. So it remains to be seen whether July 26, 2018, will come to be known as \"Facebook Thursday.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/21/104723179-GettyImages-114918637.jpg?v=1538149536", "time": "2018-07-26T17:43:58-0400", "author": "Sam Yeh | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "AMD's strong sales results are a better barometer for the technology industry\u2019s health than the company-specific issues at Facebook.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/heres-why-amds-soaring-stock-is-more-important-as-a-tech-bellwether-.html", "title": "Why AMD's soaring stock is a more important tell on the tech industry's health than Facebook's plunge", "keywords": [{"term": " Sam Yeh", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images Wall Street", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AMD", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "daily", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the third and fourth quarters", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AMD", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "10:47 AM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "30 July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "05:54 Chief", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "David Wehner", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "mid-30s", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "44 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the billions of dollars", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Wehner", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than 20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "after-hours", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "19 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "176.26", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "One", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Citi Research", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mark May", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Squawk on the Street", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "AMD", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "53 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Lisa Su", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "seven years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Su", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "AMD", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "14 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}], "body": " Sam Yeh | AFP | Getty Images Wall Street is buzzing over Facebook's lower profit margin guidance, driving an epic plunge in its shares Thursday. But investors shouldn't be too concerned about whether the social media giant's disappointment will drive the rest of the technology sector lower. AMD's strong sales results are a better barometer for the industry's health than the company-specific issues at Facebook. On Wednesday Facebook reported slightly lower-than-expected second-quarter sales and daily active user numbers. But the bigger problem was its guidance for slower sales growth for the third and fourth quarters and a dramatically reduced forecast for long-term profit margins. show chapters AMD CEO: Our focus is about bringing new products to market 10:47 AM ET Mon, 30 July 2018 | 05:54 Chief financial officer David Wehner said the company's operating profit margin will fall to the \"mid-30s on a percentage basis\" over a more than two-year period, compared with second-quarter operating margin of 44 percent. \"We're also making the significant long-term investments in safety and security. Those investments are in the billions of dollars per year. Those will have a negative impact on margins,\" Wehner said on the earnings call Wednesday. \"We think that's the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring the community's safety and security and the durability of the franchise.\" Facebook shares plunged more than 20 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday after the guidance. The stock closed down 19 percent Thursday to $176.26. One Wall Street analyst believes Facebook is doing the right thing by investing to clean up and restore trust in its platform. \"This is a challenging time for [Facebook], but you have to put that into perspective \u2026 The companies that invest for the long term, companies like Amazon, tend to do much better than the companies that aren't investing heavily,\" Citi Research analyst Mark May said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Thursday. \"A lot of this is trying to control the PR a bit by showing how much they are spending to keep the regulators off their back.\" While Facebook is engineering its own slowdown to fight misinformation and secure its website, AMD's better-than-expected second-quarter sales and earnings results point to broad-based strength in technology industry spending. AMD sells high-profit-margin server chips to data centers and cloud computing providers, which companies use to add capacity to serve their customers. The chipmaker's revenue soared 53 percent year over year in the reported quarter. AMD CEO Lisa Su said on the earnings call Wednesday the company's chip sales to data centers \"increased significantly\" and \"saw some nice acceleration.\" She also added the personal computer market is \"doing a little bit better than most people expected.\" \"We had an outstanding second quarter with strong revenue growth, margin expansion and our highest quarterly net income in seven years,\" Su said in the earnings press release Wednesday. AMD's stock closed up 14 percent Thursday. Good news for the chipmaker is likely positive news for the technology industry's business trends too.

The June proposal from BATS BZX Exchange to list and trade the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust's commodity-based shares was voted down 3-1 by the commission Thursday. The price of bitcoin dipped 3 percent to $7,880 following the news, according to data from Coinbase. Last year, the SEC disapproved an application for the \"Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust\" but in June, the group submitted a proposed rule change. Among other arguments, the agency said in a release Thursday that it did not support the Winklevoss's argument that bitcoin markets, including the Gemini Exchange, are \"uniquely resistant to manipulation.\" It also highlighted issues of fraud and investor protection. The SEC emphasized that the disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin or blockchain technology has value as an innovation or investment. But the agency indicated that its mission is designed to prevent fraudulent or manipulative acts or practices and to protect investors, and that they were concerned about fraud and manipulation of bitcoin, particularly since this is done in a largely unregulated offshore market. \"Despite today's ruling, we look forward to continuing to work with the SEC and remain deeply committed to bringing a regulated bitcoin ETF to market and building the future of money,\" Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and President of Gemini said regarding the matter. The U.S. financial watchdog has yet to approve a cryptocurrency-based ETF. It published a letter in January pointing to \"significant investor protection issues that need to be examined\" before sponsors can offer these funds to retail investors. The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges. The bid-ask spreads varied widely across exchanges, the SEC said. The volume in bitcoin futures markets are small: 20 percent the volume of platinum, and 2.5 percent that of silver. As for assertions that bitcoin is uniquely resistant to manipulations, the SEC \"finds that the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.\" There is another bitcoin ETF application that is still active \u2014 the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. The SEC had no comment about that application. VanEck and SolidX filed a joint application for a bitcoin ETF, which was published for comment on July 2. According to Dodd Frank rules, the agency needs to take action within 45 days of the publication of that proposal, which falls on August 16. Bitcoin soared two a two-month high above $8,300 this week, partially because of rumors that the SEC could approve a similar trading vehicle as early as August. While they need to address one proposal by August 16, based on the agency's denial of other ETFs, it could be multiple months before a meaningful announcement. This week, the agency SEC delayed deliberations on five other bitcoin ETFs filed by NYSE Arca, Inc. Asset manager Bitwise joined the list of hopefuls on Tuesday, and filed for an ETF that would track a basket of cryptocurrencies.

He climbed to a senior executive role at AT&T before he was 40, jumped ship to work at Priceline when the travel website was still a start-up, then took Virgin Mobile USA from an idea to a business with five million subscribers. After stops at Sprint and American Express, Mr. Schulman joined PayPal in 2014, overseeing its split from eBay the next year. Since then, PayPal's stock has more than doubled, quieting doubters who wondered if the online payments company would be a sustainable business over the long term. Read more from The New York Times: C.E.O. activism has become the new normal Memo from the boss: you're a vegetarian now Stacy Brown-Philpot of TaskRabbit on being a black Woman in Silicon Valley He is also a regular practitioner of Krav Maga, the martial art system practiced by the Israeli military, and has the scars to prove it. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at PayPal's offices in New York. What was your childhood like? I grew up in New Jersey, first Newark and then New Brunswick. We lived in a fully integrated neighborhood. My mom was an activist. She pushed me in a baby carriage at a Martin Luther King Jr. rally. She marched in the civil rights marches, not just in the North but in the South as well. It takes courage to go and do that. You started working for AT&T right out of school and wound up staying there for 18 years. What did you learn during that time? Early on in my career I had a family tragedy where my sister died, and I was leading a team at the time. That was a devastating time for me and my family. I had to take time off. I came back several months later and the team had just gelled together to say, \"We're going to cover for Dan. We're going to do everything.\" And when I was presenting to the AT&T board about the accomplishments of this team, I couldn't take any credit because I deserved no credit. This idea of the power of giving credit to others \u2014 as opposed to your own individual accomplishment \u2014 has shaped my entire career. Most people don't really think about that. They mostly think, \"Look at me.\" But really if you say, \"Look at what others are accomplishing,\" it's so much more powerful in terms of your ability to attract the best people, to get things done. You left AT&T for Priceline when it was just a start-up. That was a big risk. Why not just stay at AT&T? I was president of the consumer division at age 39 or so. But my view was not so much that leaving was a risk. I actually thought it's more risky to stand still. There's a philosophy in martial arts which is, \"Never stand still.\" Standing still is asking to be hit. You always have to be willing to take some risks going forward. You can't stand still. I have this advice that I give to people I mentor. I always say, \"Don't overthink your next step, because none of us know where we're going to be 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\" One step leads to another. What changes have you made to PayPal's organizational structure as C.E.O.? I've taken my team from 21 direct reports to eight direct reports. To me, a great team is one that discusses all of the issues. When you have 21 people, it's not a discussion; it's a presentation. There's no way that 21 voices can be heard around a table. It's a cacophony of voices. The smaller the team is, the more you can discuss issues in depth and detail, and there becomes a trust among the team. PayPal was one of the first financial companies to take a stand on guns. How did you arrive at that decision? If you're going to have a consistent set of values that you stand up for, they have to be reflected in your acceptable use policy. Around the violence in Charlottesville, we identified a number of groups that espouse hate or violence, and we don't allow them to use PayPal to fund-raise. And we do not allow PayPal to be used for guns and ammunition. That there are rules and regulations in terms of background checks is extraordinarily important. But if somebody is going to do something online, we can't fully vouch for those background checks. And so therefore we just outlaw it. It's not always comfortable for C.E.O.s to take a stand on these issues. How do you decide where to draw that line? Companies, and by extension their management teams and their C.E.O.s, have a moral obligation to try to be a force for good. I don't think there's any way that we can shirk that responsibility, and I don't think there's any way to fully stand away from the culture wars around us. You have to take a stand. That stand shouldn't be a political one. But it should be one that is based on your values and your mission. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to fully stand away from the culture wars around us. You have to take a stand.\" -Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal You practice martial arts, right? I practice Krav Maga. I spent some time in Israel when I was young, and they have what's called Youth Military Training there, so I started then. That was when I was in my teens, and I've been doing Krav since then. Have you ever gotten hurt? Oh my gosh. I mean, look at my knuckles. These are all from punches. I'm always black or blue or I have some scar on my face. I've dislocated my shoulder. I've had stitches. If you look carefully on my face, stitches here, stitches here. Smacked into a mat here, here. That's how you learn how to be cool, calm and collected in very stressful situations. But the overrunning philosophy of Krav is that the best way to win a fight is to not get into a fight. It's very Zen in that way. How do you de-escalate situations? We spend a lot of time thinking about that. It's translated into the way that I think about business as well. When we started partnering with Visa and Mastercard and JPMorgan Chase and Citi, nobody ever thought that PayPal would be allies with those companies. That would always be an uneasy friend relationship. But my view is, \"How do you give customers the choice they want, and how do you avoid fights that you don't necessarily need to be in?\" And it was maybe one of the key things that catapulted PayPal's success in recent years. A reader on Twitter, Kyle Rosenbaum, asked about India's effort to ban cash. Do you think we'll see more countries doing that in the future? There are two mega-trends happening right now in the financial services industry. One: You're seeing the digitization of payments. People are moving away from checks. People are slowly but surely moving away from cash. That's driven by the other big trend, which is the explosion of smartphones. In smartphones, you have all of the power of a bank branch in the palm of your hand. You can do basic transactions at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time that it took you before. That can enable so many of these underserved populations to come into the mainstream as well and do things that perhaps you and I take for granted, and it can actually make a real difference in their lives. The demonetization in India is one of the most audacious and bold experiments that a government has done. India is one of the last places you would think that would try to get rid of cash, but there's a huge issue that goes on. There's a huge amount of graft and corruption. But if the government can directly send that money to you electronically, right into a digital account or a bank account, that could be incredibly impactful in that country. Whether it fully works or not, it is a harbinger of things to come. What do you still use cash for? I don't use a lot of cash right now. Things that I used to use cash for, like paying babysitters, now everybody has Venmo and it's simpler and easier. Some people feel that cash is a more anonymous form of payment, and I would never predict the death of cash over the next decade or two. I think cash is going to be with us for a long time to come. But there is a clear trend toward digitization. It's just a more efficient, time-efficient, cost-efficient way to managing your money.

The federal government acknowledged on Friday that your last few cellphones were more valuable than it thought. That disclosure came tucked in a package of revisions the government made to the economic growth statistics it published from 2012 to 2017. From time to time, data wizards at the Commerce Department take a new look at their past estimates of how large the economy was in a given quarter, and how fast it was growing, and re-evaluate those estimates using new information that has come to light. More from the New York Times: Wages are rising in Europe. But economists are puzzled. GDP grew at 4.1% rate in US in latest quarter. Here's what that means. US Businesses are bullish amid worldwide instability This year, that new information includes a better way to measure the quality of cellphones, which, you may have noticed, usually improve with each new iteration. The statisticians concluded America's imported cellphones were improving more rapidly than previously calculated \u2014 that consumers had actually gotten more for their money than we thought. That change had a ripple effect, all the way up to annual economic growth figures, which emerged from the revisions ever so slightly changed from previous estimates. Here are four takeaways from the total package of revisions: The economy under President Obama was better than advertised Revisions added $82.7 billion to the size of the United States economy at the end of 2016, which means it grew a tenth of a percentage point faster in President Barack Obama's second term than previously thought. Growth in President Trump's first year in office, 2017, was actually smaller by the same amount. That's not an economic earthquake, but the headline change does mask some bigger swings in individual components of gross domestic product. For example, companies appear to have invested $110 billion more in 2012 than previously thought, largely because the statisticians more or less missed some huge corporate spending on cloud computing technology. The revisions employed improved measures of I.T. investments, and voil\u00e0. Winter's not as cold as it seemed For a while now, experts at the Bureau of Economic Analysis have struggled with something called seasonal adjustment, which is their way to rebalance raw economic data to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison of growth at different times of the year. Even after two rounds of fixes, growth in the first quarter, which includes most of the winter, has consistently run lower than subsequent quarters. This revision brought what the bureau said were the final batch of fixes, and it has changed past winter numbers to look much better \u2014 and made some quarters from later in the year look worse. Growth in the first quarter of 2016 has been revised up to 1.5 percent, from 0.6 percent. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was revised down to 2.3 percent, from 2.9 percent. (That revision complicates Republican claims that growth was surging with companies' expectation that President Trump would sign a big tax cut package into law, by the way, but the revision for the first quarter of 2018 that is announced Friday could help their case that the enactment of the law sped up growth.) Over all, growth averaged 2.1 percent in the first quarter from 2012 to 2017, up from 1.6 percent. For the third quarter, it averaged 2.4 percent, down from 2.7 percent. That may not perfectly smooth out the seasonal bumps,but it's close. Americans are saving more than we knew Possibly the most dramatic shift in the revisions came in the bureau's measure of the personal savings rate, which is how much Americans set aside as a share of their income each year. Last year, that rate looked really low: 3.4 percent, a level that economists warned could mean consumer spending could fall off, dampening growth. Well, surprise! It was a mistake, apparently. The bureau made use of a new Internal Revenue Service analysis and concluded that the government had been overestimating the amount of national income held by corporations and underestimating how much of it was held by proprietors of businesses. That meant people \u2014 as opposed to corporations \u2014 had been sitting on more money than the government previously thought. And that meant the savings rate was higher. The revised rate for 2017 nearly doubled, to 6.7 percent. So Americans aren't spending as unwisely as previously thought, although other statistics provide a sobering reminder of how unprepared many people are for an economic shock: In 2016, 44 percent of American households said they would not be able to easily handle a hypothetical emergency expense of $400, according to the Federal Reserve. Your cellphone made the trade deficit worse than we thought Americans buy a lot of phones that are made in other countries. And those phones keep getting better \u2014 a phone you can buy for $100 today is capable of much more (for good or ill) than the phone you bought for the same price in 2013. That means it's more valuable. Using a new tool from the Fed, the government is now better able to estimate the value of that improvement \u2014 and see how much it underestimated it in the past. And it turns out they underestimated by a lot. The revisions make clear that the phones Americans were importing were more valuable phones, in inflation-adjusted terms, that previously thought. Because that pushes up the real value of imports, it adds to the trade deficit, which has been in the news a bit lately. Increasing the trade deficit detracts from the gross domestic product, so we're left with an interesting math exercise from all these revisions. For 2015, for example, a positive revision to the G.D.P. from larger-than-previously-measured levels of investment and personal spending was partially canceled out by the increase in the trade deficit from the phone you bought. In other words, you got a better deal than you knew on that phone. Which kind of hurt the economy. At least, so far as we can tell right now.

Same-store used car sales in the U.S. were up 11 percent in the quarter. \"That's a number I've never seen before,\" Hesterberg said on \"Power Lunch.\" Sales of new vehicles also rose, 7.4 percent. The company, the third-largest auto retailer in the U.S., beat Wall Street's expectations Thursday when it posted a 44 percent increase in quarterly profits. Hesterberg credits the increased sales in used vehicles for the jump and said internal measures were put in place to promote used vehicle offerings. Those included focusing on lower-priced used cars that were once sent to auction and adjusting the amount of money salespeople can earn from selling used cars. \"Typically you make a little bit more margin on a used car than you do on a new car,\" he said. \"It's a good business,\" Hesterberg said, adding that sales have typically been higher in larger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs. \"In markets like Texas, for us it's as much as 80 percent truck and SUV ... [in the U.S.] overall, probably closer to 70 [percent],\" he said. \"I wouldn't say sedans are dead, but it's certainly a shrinking part of our business.\" David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images The company, with dealerships in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil, reported net income of $56.46 million, or $2.72 a share, up from $39.13 million, or $1.84 a share, a year earlier. The news came after a very bad day for automakers on Wednesday. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all scaled back their 2018 earnings forecasts due to rising prices for raw materials. Shares of all three companies fell as a result, although Fiat Chrysler was trading higher during Thursday's intraday trading. Despite the positive earnings beat, Group 1 was down nearly 2 percent during Thursday's intraday trading. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had agreed to work \"towards zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies for the non-auto industrial goods.\" Hesterberg said he was \"absolutely relieved\" by the news. \"Any appreciable tariff ... would ultimately increase the price of new cars. We represent a lot of German brands ... also, imports from Mexico and Canada. We retail cars that come from all those markets,\" he said. \"And if prices were to go up \u2014 selling prices \u2014 volume would come down. And ultimately that hurts us.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/01/27/104245575-final-trade-logo.jpg?v=1485535953", "time":

On Thursday, the company reported earnings per share of $5.07 compared with $2.50 as expected by Thomson Reuters. But Aswath Damodaran, a professor of corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who is sometimes referred to as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" said this is not all good news. \"Amazon terrifies me as a company,\" Damodaran told CNBC on \"Fast Money\" Thursday. \"You find it overvalued but you cannot bet against it because this is a disruption machine,\" he said. \"I'm not even sure what business the company is in anymore. It's a platform that can be used pretty much to disrupt any business.

Its North America revenue jumped 44 percent to $32.1 billion, while international sales grew 27 percent to $14.6 billion. The company's cloud business grew nearly 49 percent year-over-year, with Amazon Web Services generating $6.11 billion in revenue. Amazon recently moved into the health care space by acquiring PillPack. Shares of the e-commerce giant closed about 3 percent down, but soared more than 4 percent during Thursday after hours trading. Amazon could not immediately be reached for a comment. Meanwhile, other FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) tech giants fell on Thursday. Facebook missed projections on revenue and daily active users during the quarter, which caused the stock to fall more than 24 percent after the report. The trouble continued on Thursday as shares fell as much as 19 percent. Global daily active users rose to 1.47 billion, up from 1.45 billion. Still, the platform lost users in Europe, and active users in North America were flat. \"After one of the worst quarters, in terms of PR, that a company\u2019s had, I was surprised that the user numbers actually went up,\" Damodaran said. \"After April, the market seemed to have forgotten all about the privacy scandal and gone back to business as usual. And I think they got a surprise yesterday that they deserve,\" he added. He felt that a better measure of the company's success is the number of hours people spend on Facebook, but said that those numbers were still unknown. Still, he said the stock is undervalued, and right now is a good time to buy with share prices down to around $180. Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment. \u2014 CNBC's Eugene Kim contributed to this report.

Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have raised interest rates twice this year and have indicated two more are coming before the end of 2018. The CME FedWatch tool, which is based on Fed fund futures trading, put the chances of a September rate increase at 91.4 percent on Friday. \"I think that's way too high,\" the chief economic advisor at Allianz said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"If I looked only at the U.S., I would buy the 92 percent. But I think there are other things happening in the world.\" El-Erian's probability of a rate hike was above 50 percent because of \"headwinds from the rest of the world.\" \"If it is 92 percent, then I think we're going to see a lot more stress on various markets, including the global fixed income market, including the FX market. So that is a really important estimate,\" he said. However, the political stakes may be different for the Fed this time around. In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, President Donald Trump expressed frustration with the Fed's recent move to raise interest rates and said the central bank could disrupt the U.S. economic recovery. A day later, the president criticized the Fed monetary policy again in a tweet. Tweet El-Erian said the Fed will likely attempt to ignore the president's criticism. He said the central bank will say, 'Let's assume it didn't happen' rather than say 'let's worry about what it does means if we move or not move.'\" Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

The firm reaffirmed its sell rating for Tesla shares, predicting the electric car maker will report second-quarter earnings per share below expectations. \"We are cautious on TSLA Q2 results \u2026 Q2 results [will] likely highlight cash flow and profit challenges,\" analyst Colin Langan said in a note to clients entitled \"Is the pricing strategy a prelude to a capital raise?\" \"The market should not ignore fundamental headwinds that persist with regards to TSLA's Model 3 profitability, stationary storage, and solar. \u2026 [W]e believe TSLA will eventually need additional outside funding.\" Tesla shares declined 2.4 percent Monday. Langan reaffirmed his $195 12-month price target for Tesla shares, representing 34 percent downside from Friday close. The analyst noted the current available Model 3 ordering configurations are at higher price points, ranging from $49,000 to $80,000 per vehicle. \"We do not see sustainable profitability in the second half; however, given the higher priced initial mix, a Q3 profit is possible if TSLA can average production of over 3k/week. We expect margins to correct in 2019 as the mix normalizes toward a long term average,\" he said. \"Our Sell thesis remains focused on cash burn, sustainable profitability, and quality concerns.\" In May, Tesla said it expects positive GAAP net income in its third and fourth quarters. The analyst lowered his Tesla second-quarter earnings per share forecast to a $3 loss from a $1.71 loss versus the Wall Street consensus estimate of a $2.88 loss. He raised his third-quarter earnings per share projection to a positive 72 cents from a 81 cent loss but lowered his 2019 earnings per share estimate to a $1.65 loss from a $1.15 loss versus the $2.34 consensus.

Source: djdsolmusic | Instagram Goldman Sachs\u2019 next chief executive officer and chairman, David Solomon, often talks about his personal interests, including an unusual side gig as a dance club disc jockey. Now, he wants his leaders to open up. Solomon, 56, was asked about his hobby at a recent conference for clients and executives, according to Brian Levine, a Goldman partner and co-head of global equities trading. Last week, Solomon was formally named successor to longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein, taking over on Oct. 1. \"David is very aware that we've got to be more open,\" Levine said in an interview. To help foster connections with employees and clients, Solomon said that \"leaders today have to be more vulnerable, they have to put themselves out there a lot more than they probably are comfortable doing,\" said Levine. show chapters Goldman Sachs is a company that tries to reinvent itself, says analyst 2:12 AM ET Wed, 18 July 2018 | 03:01 Solomon's push for openness embodies a shift that is occurring throughout the 149-year-old investment bank. Housed in an imposing steel-and-glass tower on Manhattan's West Side whose unmarked entrance was recently watched by four hulking security guards, the bank emerged from the financial crisis with a reputation as an insular trading juggernaut. Before regulations restricted the practice, Goldman was perhaps Wall Street's most successful proprietary trading house \u2014 but the fact that it was making bets with its own money left some clients wondering if the firm always had their best interests at heart. To succeed in a world where volatile trading revenue is seen as less desirable than steady fee-generating businesses, Solomon will have to transform Goldman into a friendlier financial firm that touches \u2014 and wins the trust \u2014 of many more ordinary consumers and corporations. The pivot is a more delicate change than one undergone by other institutions under more immediate duress, from Wells Fargo to Facebook to Uber, which have been forced to adapt in the face of crippling scandals. Instead, Goldman and its new leader need to prove it can develop nascent sources of revenue and shed more of its legacy as a private partnership to attract customers and employees. Goldman shares have fallen about 7 percent this year through Thursday, the worst performance of the six biggest U.S. banks. New markets, new image Blankfein has acknowledged that the company's secrecy \u2014 it rarely had advertisements and didn't even put its name on its headquarters \u2014 helped create a void that outsiders filled with unflattering narratives. After making lucrative bets against the U.S. housing market a decade ago, it was labeled a \"vampire squid\" by Rolling Stone magazine. The company's track record of producing government officials, including two Treasury secretaries in the past decade, has helped fuel conspiracy theories about the bank's connections. \"In general we never publicized what we did anywhere,\" Blankfein said in a 2016 interview. \"After the crisis, we realized that we didn't communicate enough with the public to let them know who we were and what our contribution was to society.\" Solomon, who joined Goldman in 1999, was one of the architects of a plan unveiled in September to boost revenue by $5 billion by broadening its client base beyond hedge funds and asset managers, finding growth in smaller markets and pushing into retail products. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images David Solomon, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., gives a thumbs-up during a discussion at the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, D.C., In April, the firm acquired a personal finance start-up called Clarity Money. The company's app, which will serve as the gateway to all of Goldman's digital finance products, has positioned itself as an unbiased consumer advocate. It helps its 1 million users save money by securing discounts on services or cancelling unnecessary subscriptions. Under the Marcus brand, Goldman currently offers deposits and personal loans but will eventually offer a full suite of products, from wealth management to mortgages and life insurance. \"We've got your back,\" are the words sprawled on a 40-foot column advertising Clarity Money in the bank's headquarters. Goldman began its first advertising campaign aimed at consumers in 2016, an effort they ramped up this year, along with an aggressive direct-mail effort. And the bank now regularly posts videos and podcasts of executive interviews and tweets photos showing glimpses of life at the firm, including a shot Thursday commemorating Shark Week. Opening up The cultural shift includes more transparency on financial targets. Analysts have voiced frustration with the lack of information Goldman offers on its various businesses. Under Solomon, the bank is considering hosting its first-ever Investor Day next year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. At similar events held by competitors, firms typically disclose multiyear financial targets, giving analysts the chance to hold management accountable. Solomon is attempting to modernize the firm in other ways. Days after Solomon's promotion was announced, the bank said three women were joining its management committee, nearly doubling female representation in the powerful group, according to a memo. \"People want to work at an organization that's diverse, that's open, that has all different kinds of people, that is very accepting,\" Solomon said in an October podcast. More broadly, the firm has opened its executive ranks to outsiders at a pace not seen since the New York-based bank went public in 1999. It hired 15 executives at the most senior rank of partner in the past year, a trend that will continue, according to The Wall Street Journal. Levine, who joined Goldman in 1994 and has steadily climbed the ranks of the firm's equities division, said Solomon has helped managers begin to loosen a historically buttoned-up culture. \"If you're a leader it's easy to be authoritarian and to tell everyone, 'This is the way it is,'\" Levine said. \"It's a lot harder to share information, get feedback and have an open dialogue.\" Levine, 47, said he posts \"fairly aggressively\" to internal social media-like platforms to help foster an atmosphere that's more welcoming to millennial employees, who are known for constant sharing of their personal lives. He also organizes an annual fundraiser for a Harlem nonprofit that allows hundreds of Goldman employees to compete in a whiffle ball tournament. Events like that create a \"social environment, it enables people to blend their outside life with their inside life,\" Levine said. \"You see in surveys of millennials, they say that's what they want at work.\" 'I was shaking' The news coverage of Solomon's hobby caught him off guard when headlines emerged last year, he said, according to a transcript of a May conference. But Solomon eventually decided that sharing more of his personal life with subordinates makes him more approachable. In the 2017 podcast, Solomon said he was a music fan for decades, owning more than 1,000 vinyl records in college. When digital streaming allowed broader exposure to different genres, Solomon realized he enjoyed electronic dance music, or EDM. Solomon has since embraced the spotlight, releasing an EDM single called \"Don't Stop\" in June under his stage name D-Sol. He has 465,337 monthly listeners on Spotify. He's also been spotted performing before crowds in venues from Brooklyn's Williamsburg to the Hamptons, according to news reports. \"It's something I'm really passionate about,\" Solomon said in the podcast. \"If you can't find a way to have passions and pursue those passions and mix them into your professional life and your personal life, it's just harder to have the energy to keep on doing this.\" Solomon may be uniquely suited for the new Goldman. Where Blankfein is known for a quick wit, Solomon is more likely to come off as disarmingly earnest. The day after a ceremony where he was formally introduced by Blankfein as his successor, Solomon spoke to a roomful of the bank's interns, expressing wonder that he would soon be running the place. \"When Lloyd called me up at the stage, I was pretty emotional about it, it really affected me,\" Solomon said. \"I was shaking.\" WATCH: What Goldman's new boss means for its strategy show chapters Goldman's New Boss: What does it mean for its strategy? 11:14 AM ET Tue, 24 July 2018 | 06:23 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/08/104640105-Dimon-Intv-126.jpg?v=1530640283", "time": "2018-07-31T07:24:31-0400", "author": "Mark Urban | CNBC", "description": "J.P.

And he spent 10 years getting books right.\" \"So we may spent a bunch of time getting one piece of it right, and testing various things to see what works,\" he added. Mark Urban | CNBC Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Dimon, 62, is the longest-tenured of CEOs leading a major U.S. bank. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase announced earlier this year a partnership to cut health-care costs and improve services for their U.S. employees. The companies, which employ more than 1.1 million workers combined, will launch an independent operation that's intended to be free from profit-making incentives. The chief executive added that the joint venture upset some of J.P. Morgan's clients, but said that if some chose to leave as a result of the initiative \"so be it.\" The new company's goal at first will be to target technology solutions to simplify the health-care system. \"I want to do a better job, and we're going to put more brainpower, more capability to figure out how we can make you healthier and happier with better satisfaction,\" Dimon added, noting that approximately 20 percent of U.S. gross domestic product is spent on health care. \"We're totally in-line with Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2013 Amazon and Berkshire.\" The business trio tapped renowned surgeon and author Atul Gawande in June to lead the joint venture in the hopes to slash cost. Gawande, an outspoken critic of the industry's medical practices, has argued against prolonging a poor quality of life for the elderly and terminally ill, saying health care institutions often deprive patients of independence and quality of life. \"We think together we have the right people, a long-term view, we're not profit-seeking, and that we can do what we're doing a lot better,\" Dimon said. \"We don't expect progress in the immediate future \u2013 like a year or two \u2013 but if we come up with some great stuff, we're going to share it with everybody.\" WATCH: Meet Dr. Atul Gawande, CEO of Buffett-Dimon-Bezos health-care venture show chapters Meet Dr. Atul Gawande, CEO of the Buffett-Dimon-Bezos health-care venture 3:16 PM ET Wed, 20 June 2018 | 01:05 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/01/19/104228674-GettyImages-166666698.jpg?v=1532960626", "time": "2018-07-30T14:14:54-0400", "author": "Scott Eells | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Amex's foreign exchange unit recruited small business customers with low currency conversion rates only to quietly raise those rates later.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/30/american-express-forex-sales-practices-latest-to-draw-bait-and-switch-.html", "title": "American Express said it is conducting external review after report about sales tactics", "keywords": [{"term": "American Express", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "WSJ", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "FX", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1:14 PM ET Mon", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "30", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "July 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "00:37 American Express", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The Wall Street Journal", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "more than a decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Amex", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Amex", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo & Co.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the hour", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Wells Fargo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "two years ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "400", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the National Employment Law Project", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the Committee for Better Banks", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "More than half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "hourly", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "56 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "just 14 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "J.

The card issuer is the latest to attract scrutiny for allegedly using bait-and-switch sales practices. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the card company's foreign exchange unit recruited small business customers with low currency conversion rates only to quietly raise those rates later without notification. The practice, which ended earlier this year, went on for more than a decade, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Small business are a major source of growth for Amex, which recently won the right to issue a new credit card for Amazon's small business customers. In a memo to employees on Monday, Amex said it takes the allegations \"very seriously\" and was doing the review \"to determine whether all of our standards are being met.\" The memo also said \"If we find that we fell short of the mark, we will fix the problems and take appropriate actions to make sure it doesn't recur.\" Banks have long used introductory offers to win over new customers, only to raise rates or otherwise make the products more expensive down the road. And a recent survey reveals that despite the high profile sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co., bank employees still feel pressure to meet sales goals. Tying sales to bonuses or other incentive awards has been a long-standing practice in banking, where many employees are paid by the hour. Abuses such as the practices uncovered at Wells Fargo two years ago, where employees opened fake accounts in customers names just to meet aggressive sales hurdles, has put a new focus on how banks reward employees for selling products. But despite the scrutiny, the failure to meet sales quotas can still result in bullying, retaliation or possible termination, according to a recent survey of 400 employees of some of the nation's largest banks by the National Employment Law Project and consumer groups making up the Committee for Better Banks. More than half of the respondents in the survey said hourly pay was supplemented by incentive awards or other bonuses, and 56 percent of the goals were based on the amount of sales made, not customer satisfaction (that category got just 14 percent.) The survey included employees at big banks like J. P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi but not American Express. Nearly half the respondents said failing to meet goals would result in a one on one meeting with a supervisor, while one-quarter said it would result in disciplinary action and slightly more than that said it could lead to termination. Just 10 percent said there were no consequences. A spokeswoman for Amex told CNBC in an email that the company's offered foreign exchange rates are competitive with the current marketplace and that the rates, with the exception of a few larger clients, aren't based on a contractual pricing commitment or spread agreed to in advance. \"The system is designed to allow clients to compare our offered rates for their transactions with the rates available from our competitors,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We have training, control and compliance oversight and believe that our transactions are completed and reported in a fair and transparent manner at the rates which the client has authorized.\" The WSJ report said Amex's sales people who hit their targets got a commission of 15 percent of the monthly revenue new customers generated, and the commission rate rose to 25 percent once an annual revenue target was exceeded.

A large number of advancing issues is a bullish signal for market sentiment. Lately, breadth has been narrowing with fewer stocks pushing the broader market higher. In fact, the top 10 contributors of gains in the S&P 500 have accounted for two-thirds of the index's overall returns this year, Kostin said. But Kostin said that from a historical perspective, \"market breadth has not yet narrowed enough to signal investing danger,\" noting that: \"Unlike past episodes of narrow market breadth, the earnings environment today appears healthy and broad-based. The top 10 S&P 500 stocks currently account for 20% of index earnings, roughly the same as in each of the last few years, and slightly below the 30-year average of 21%.\" Facebook shares posted their worst day ever Thursday \u2014 falling 19 percent \u2014 a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue and disappointing global daily active users, a key metric for the company. The social media company's steep decline put pressure on the broader tech sector, which is down 3.6 percent since the release of its quarterly results through Friday's close. Tech shares added to their losses Monday, dropping 1.3 percent as Facebook and Netflix both fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Google parent Alphabet also declined 0.6 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Tech's fall has raised concern about the market's narrow leadership since most of this year's returns in the S&P 500 come from large-cap tech names like Facebook. In fact, the social network's losses led to hedge funds losing nearly $6 billion. Facebook was hedge funds' favorite stock before the drop, according to a previous report by Goldman. Still, tech stocks are the best performers year to date. Through Friday's close, the sector is up 14.1 percent while the overall S&P 500 index has gained just 5.4 percent in 2018. Kostin said that while the sector is still a favorite among hedge funds, \"1Q position filings showed that tilts in the sector are smaller now than they were in 2016 and 2017. Other positioning data including our Sentiment Indicator suggest overall portfolio length has declined significantly in recent months, reducing concerns of crowding.\" He also said, \"The pricing power of many Tech firms should help insulate them from the margin risks posed by escalating trade conflict.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/23/103658353-GettyImages-474385882.jpg?v=1532971758", "time": "2018-07-30T16:31:15-0400", "author": "Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "Kroger announced Monday that a California subsidiary will no longer accept Visa credit cards as of mid-August as the two companies clash over payment fees and rates.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/30/kroger-california-subsidiary-to-bar-visa-credit-cards-amid-fee-dispute.html", "title": "Kroger's California subsidiary to bar Visa credit cards amid fee dispute", "keywords": [{"term": "Simon Dawson", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "California", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "mid-August", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "\" Foods Co.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Foods Co.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Aug. 14", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "21 Foods Co.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "California", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "San Francisco", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Sacramento", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "MasterCard", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "American Express", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Discover", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Christopher Hjelm", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Foods Co.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Monday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "3.5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Kroger", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "the tens of billions of dollars", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "each year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Supreme Court", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "earlier this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "American Express", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "The Justice Department", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amex", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Mastercard", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Visa", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amex", "category": "ORG"}], "body": " Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer enters their pin number while making a chip and pin payment using a Visa payment card. Kroger announced Monday that a California subsidiary will no longer accept Visa credit cards as of mid-August as the two companies clash over payment fees and rates. \"Visa's rates and fees are among the highest of any credit card brand,\" Foods Co. said in an emailed statement Monday. \"The savings will be passed along to Foods Co. customers in the form of low everyday prices on the items shoppers purchase most.\" The ban on Visa credit cards will take effect starting Aug. 14 and affect 21 Foods Co. stores and fuel centers in central and north California. Though stores in major cities like San Francisco and Sacramento will be affected by the change, customers will still be able to use Visa debit cards, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards as usual, the statement added. \"There are ongoing discussions about payment technologies,\" Christopher Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger, told CNBC. \"We've been working to get the economics right and we are taking a step to make sure we continue to get our customers the best value.\" Visa said it was frustrated with Kroger's move. \"Visa is disappointed at Kroger's decision to stop accepting Visa credit cards at its Foods Co. stores,\" it said in a statement. \"When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins. Our goal is to protect the interests of our cardholders to ensure they can use their Visa credit cards wherever they shop. Visa remains committed to working with Kroger to reach a reasonable solution.\" Shares of Visa fell 3 percent Monday amid the news while Kroger's stock closed up 3.5 percent. The dispute between Kroger and Visa is just the latest in a string of battles over the tens of billions of dollars merchants pay each year in swipe fees. For example, the Supreme Court concluded earlier this year that American Express rules that don't allow merchants to offer promotions or discounts on rival cards that charge them lower fees don't violate federal antitrust law. The Justice Department initially sued Amex and its larger rivals Mastercard and Visa, arguing that merchants had no real bargaining power when it came to using their payment services. A lower court had ruled that Amex's \"anti-steering\" rules stifled competition.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.46 percent to 7,737.42, its biggest drop since June 27, when it fell 1.54 percent. The S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent to 2,818.82 with tech dropping 2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 76.01 points to close at 25,451.06. Tech stocks posted their second straight day of steep losses. On Thursday, the sector dropped more than 1.5 percent as Facebook posted its worst day ever. Shares of Intel and Twitter led the charge lower on Friday, falling after the release of their latest quarterly results. The decline comes after the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew last quarter at its fastest rate since the third quarter of 2014. \"When growth companies, particularly tech companies, are priced to perfection, the price for imperfection is quite high,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \"Meanwhile, the reward for beating on earnings is much lower than usual.\" \"It's a consequence of where we are in the bull market,\" Arone said. Intel dropped more than 8.5 percent after announcing delays on its next generation chips. The company did report better-than-expected earnings, however. Twitter, which reported earnings that matched expectations, dropped more than 20 percent after it said its number of monthly active users fell. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) moments before the Closing Bell on February 8, 2018 in New York City. Shares of Facebook and Apple followed Intel and Twitter lower, dropping 0.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. Netflix and Alphabet, meanwhile, both declined more than 2 percent. Thus far, over 50 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. Of those companies, 79.8 percent have reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from FactSet. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, in line with analyst expectations. In recent days, White House officials have been indicating the reading will be strong. \"You're going to get a very good economic growth number tomorrow. Big,\" White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said ahead of the release. \"While we may be late in the game when it comes to our economic expansion, we're likely not in the last inning, and I think we see that in today's numbers,\" said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. \"Sure the trade war has begun to take its toll, but our economic fundamentals continue to be solid.\" President Donald Trump touted the strong number on Friday, saying in a tweet the figure was \"GREAT.\" Trump later said in a news conference that \"we're going to go a lot higher\" than 4.1 percent GDP growth. The market's initial reaction to the data was muted, however, with stock futures briefly paring gains. \"The number at 4.1 percent is strong, but the whisper number was higher than that,\" said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. \"I think that's why you got the non-reaction in the market to it.\" \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Analysts say they are growing more confident in Amazon due to its increasing ability to generate more profits from its key opportunities. The e-commerce juggernaut said Thursday it generated second-quarter earnings per share of $5.07, crushing the $2.50 Thomson Reuters consensus. Operating profit margin came in at 5.6 percent versus the 3.2 percent FactSet analyst estimate for the quarter. Its shares closed up 0.5 percent Friday after the report. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon shares, citing the company's rising profit margins. \"Amazon reported 2Q profitability well above consensus forecasts, with operating income margin expanding 400bps yoy driven by AWS, advertising, and fulfillment efficiencies,\" analyst Heath Terry said in a note to clients Thursday. \"Guidance for 3Q operating income was also meaningfully above consensus forecasts. \u2026 We continue to believe that we are in the sweet spot between Amazon investment cycles where new fulfillment/data centers are driving accelerating growth while incremental capacity utilization and efficiency is driving margin expansion.\" Terry raised his price target to $2,300 from $2,100 for Amazon shares, representing 27 percent upside to Thursday's close. J.P. Morgan reaffirmed its overweight rating for Amazon stock, noting the rising importance of the company's cloud computing and advertising businesses to its earnings. \"Leverage in the AMZN model is coming through. Significant profitability upside in both 2Q results & the 3Q guide was driven by fast growing, high margin AWS & advertising, along w/greater efficiencies in the core,\" analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients Friday. Anmuth raised his 2018 Amazon operating profit margin forecast by 1.5 percentage points to 4.8 percent. He also increased his price target to $2,200 from $1,900 for the stock. One Wall Street analyst believes the company rising profitability is here to stay. Nomura Instinet reaffirmed its buy rating for Amazon shares, saying the internet giant may be able to squeeze more profits from its other expenses too. \"We continue to believe the composition of AMZN's sales growth signals its future margin trajectory, putting it on a march to increasing (& underappreciated) profitability, w/2Q18 representing the company's largest margin expansion in ~two years,\" analyst Simeon Siegel said in a note to clients Thursday. \"As such, we wonder whether AMZN has actually reached a size that makes it difficult to 'outspend' sales growth, suggesting that, looking ahead, leverage could come from GM and SG&A.\" Siegel raised his price target to $1,990 from $1,755 for Amazon shares.

Facebook, holds his phone after the morning session at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, July 13, 2018. Last quarter as Facebook struggled with data leaks and fake news scandals, insiders at the company were selling more stock than they typically do. In the second quarter, top executives sold 13.6 million shares, up from 8.3 million in the first quarter, and roughly triple the amount they sold in the last quarter of 2017, according to data from InsiderScore.com. To be clear, insiders sold in compliance with what's known as Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1, a preapproved selling mechanism that is completely legal. And there is no evidence to suggest they were acting on inside information about the disastrous quarter that sent Facebook's stock down nearly 20 percent Thursday. However, their timing happened to be pretty good. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":556,\"200\":470,\"300\":444,\"400\":427,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-kbiRu\"),window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"kbiRu\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"kbiRu\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); Of those 13.6 million shares sold by executives, the vast majority were offloaded by the company's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. According to the data, he dumped 13 million shares in the second quarter, double what he sold in the first quarter of the year and 10 times what he sold in the fourth quarter of last year. Three years ago, Zuckerberg announcedin a Facebook post he would sell 99 percent of his shares to fund philanthropic efforts. In a September SEC filing, Zuckerberg outlined plans to sell $6 billion in Facebook stock over the next 18 months to fund the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":363,\"200\":260,\"300\":234,\"400\":190,\"500\":190,\"700\":190,\"800\":190,\"900\":190,\"1000\":190},window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-ykYxQ\"),window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"ykYxQ\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"ykYxQ\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); The company reported second-quarter results Wednesday that missed Wall Street expectations and sent the stock tumbling after the market closed. The social media giant's market cap plummeted by $119 billion as its stock price fell by 19 percent. Facebook declined to comment on the stock sales. Rule 10b5-1 lets insiders of a publicly traded company set up a predetermined trading plan to sell the company's stock in regular intervals, in a compliant way with the Securities and Exchange Commission to avoid insider trading. Ahead of earnings, Zuckerberg sold hundreds of thousands of shares at roughly $30 above where they were trading Thursday. The CEO sold 240,000 shares during market hours Wednesday, July 25, the same day the company reported earnings, and 524,000 shares a day earlier, according to the InsiderScore.com data, which is based on SEC filings. The company's top lawyer, Colin Stretch, who announced this week he is leaving the company at the end of the year, was also among the top sellers last week and offloaded $157,000 worth of stock. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg sold $11.5 million worth, while Christopher Cox, chief product officer, sold $2 million worth. \"You have something that's an outlier here,\" said James Cox, professor at Duke University School of Law. \"It happened to be a very bad quarter that they had \u2014 it doesn't wear well.\" Other experts pointed out that the selling in the 10b5-1 format would have been an independent investment decision, made by a third party or trustee or scheduled algorithm. In this case, based on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law professor Thomas Lee Hazen said if nothing else this was \"prudent\" investing, and a good time to sell. \"Unless there was something suspect about the plan, and I doubt there was, the sales are not that surprising,\" Hazen said. \"With the stock rising, the smart thing to do would have been to sell the stock before it took eventual earning hit.\" John Coffee, professor of law and director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School, said not all sales pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 are lawful, \"although the exceptions are modest.\" He underlined Zuckerberg's estimated $80 billion net worth. Selling Facebook stock wouldn't make much of a dent, especially when most of it is not going in his own pocket. \"It would not be worth the legal risk,\" Coffee said. These plans can be used to sell for valid reasons such as for gifts to charity or taxes. However, Coffee noted typically tax-related selling spikes in the fourth quarter. But some experts say these stock-selling plans have evolved into a legal way to \"game\" the system. \"People with good lawyers, and I presume Facebook executives can afford good lawyers, do a good job of gaming the 10b5-1 plans,\" said Cox, who specializes in securities law. \"It was never supposed to be a license for systematic trading.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/07/103447821-GettyImages-144059167.jpg?v=1532697889", "time": "2018-07-27T12:21:15-0400", "author": "Scott Eells | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "J.P.

Actively managed funds are stumbling again this year. J.P. Morgan shared the latest performance data with its clients, revealing only 41 percent of active fund managers are beating their benchmark year to date versus 52 percent last year in the same time period. \"Active equity managers are facing a challenging year \u2026 with performance highly bifurcated across styles,\" U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said in a note to clients Friday. \"Large/Core Funds \u2026 category has been underperforming due to narrowing stock leadership YTD, fewer opportunities (low stock dispersion), and a series of market narratives driving style and sector rotations (e.g., fiscal/monetary policy, inflation scare, trade tensions).\" Lakos-Bujas noted 66 percent of value funds are outperforming their benchmark versus just 43 percent of growth funds. But the value index is roughly flat this year versus the growth index's 12 percent gain, offering a lower performance threshold to beat. Investors are reacting to the weak numbers by pulling $28 billion from active funds and adding $18 billion to passive funds during the second quarter. \"We estimate that Passive is now more than 50% of equity AUM,\" the strategist said. To be sure, active managers aren't doing everything incorrectly. On Thursday Facebook shares plunged 19 percent a day after its disappointing earnings report, resulting in the largest one-day market value lossin history for a U.S. stock. Goldman Sachs strategist Arjun Menon said in a report Thursday mutual funds were \"underweight FB, which boosted performance relative to benchmarks.\" The average large-cap mutual fund is underweight Facebook by 20 basis points versus its benchmark, according to Menon.

The portfolio manager called the company's founder Elon Musk a \"very smart man\" but raised concern about the CEO's ability to follow through on lofty ambitions. \"He's got execution problems,\" Eisman, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. \"He's nowhere in autonomous driving, as far as I can tell, and big competition is coming in his space next year.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eisman is one of the few investors to successfully bet against subprime mortgage securities during the financial crisis, and was a main character in Michael Lewis' best-selling book \"The Big Short.\" Eisman was depicted by actor Steve Carell in the movie, based on Lewis's book. Tesla's cash position has been an issue in the eyes of investors. The stock fell earlier this week after The Wall Street Journal cited a Tesla memo that asked a supplier last week to refund a portion of previous payments made by the company in a bid to make a profit. Following that report, insurance on Tesla's debt, which is sold as a credit default swap contract, rose to its second-highest price ever, implying that the company has a bigger risk of default. Tesla has repeatedly said it doesn't need the cash, and Elon Musk responded to the report in a tweet, saying, \"Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.\" Shares of the car-maker closed 3 percent lower Friday. The stock is down 11 percent year over year, and has fallen roughly 4.5 percent in 2018. The company is slated to report its June quarter earnings results on Aug. 1. Tesla lostnearly $2 billion last year and burned through about $3.4 billion in cash after capital investments. It had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of the March quarter. Eisman is also short real estate listing site Zillow, which he said is entering a \"terrible business\" of flipping homes. Shares of the company closed more than 7 percent lower after the interview. The portfolio manager is also betting against BBVA and UniCredit, he said. \u2014 CNBC's Tae Kim contributed to this report.

Chinese overseas investments rose from $170.2 billion in 2016 to $185.4 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by Natixis, based on numbers from think tank, the American Enterprise Institute. That's in contrast to the dip reflected in the official overseas investment figures from Beijing, which showed a decrease from $170.11 billion in 2016 to $120.8 billion in 2017. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); Numbers on mergers and acquisitions put together by Natixis tell a similar story. While completed deals declined from $147.5 billion in 2016 to $135.7 billion in 2017, based on Mergermarket data, AEI's numbers showed that completed deals actually rose from $147.6 billion in 2016 to $167.8 billion in 2017. That goes against the general view that Chinese outbound takeovers slowed last year, attributed to Beijing tightening regulations from overseas investments to ensure more strategic deal-making. Greater caution from the U.S. towards Chinese investments, also played a part. #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(\"dw-chart\");$(window).on(\"orientationchange\",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});}); But such data doesn't account for transactions made through overseas units linked to Chinese companies. \"Because China uses subsidiaries for purchases which do not consolidate in the parent company, the actual amount of purchases looks lower when using more common statistics,\" Herrero told CNBC. These \"hidden\" deals, however, are tracked in AEI's data as the think tank utilizes a different methodology and refers to news of deals through subsidiaries registered beyond China's borders. Herrero highlighted the purchase of aircraft-leasing company CIT via Avolon Holdings, an Irish firm owned by a unit controlled by Chinese conglomerate HNA \u2014 previously among one of the Chinese companies that have made the most acquisitions \u2014 as an example. Herrero said the $10.4 billion deal didn't show up in Mergermarket data, but Mergermarket told CNBC that it did tag the deal as Chinese. Though Mergermarket typically classifies deals as outbound Chinese M&A only if the headquarters of the bidder are in China, the firm told CNBC that it makes exceptions in some cases and the Avolon deal is one such case. As measures implemented by Beijing were aimed at curbing the flow of the yuan offshore, the use of overseas vehicles with foreign currency reserves were not subjected to the same restrictions as they did not increase the pressure on outflows when involved in deal-making, said Xuong Liu, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal, an advisory firm that deals with restructuring companies. Natixis also highlighted an uptick in offshore bond issuance from 2016 to 2017 as indirect proof of how official M&A data likely did not reflect the full picture when it came to tracking total overseas investments. Natixis said overseas Chinese merger activities are expected to increase this year as domestic growth continues to slow and returns on assets remain \"meagre.\" Still, the proposition of Chinese outbound investments in the U.S. will likely slide given increased scrutiny stateside, it added, with Europe expected to be a beneficiary. Clarification: This story has been updated to add Mergermarket's explanation of how it classified the Avolon deal.

Russian holdings of Treasury securities declined 84 percent between March and May, falling to $14.9 billion from $96.1 billion in just two months, according to a U.S. Treasury Department report released July 18. Financial bloggers have pounced on the news as being potentially ominous, but a few analysts suspect the transactions are more closely related to Russia's sanctions-hit economy, and portfolio allocation. Russia's ownership of U.S. debt is eclipsed by that of China and Japan, both of whom actively manage their currencies and hold more than $1 trillion each in Treasuries on their books. In fact, China's vast holdings have been cited by some observers as a \"nuclear option\" in a Chinese-American trade war, with the U.S. economy seen as vulnerable to Chinese selling that could drive up yields. Major foreign holders of U.S. debt accounted for $6.21 trillion of current U.S. debt, while the total public debt outstanding is $21.3 trillion as of July 26. show chapters Does U.S. debt matter? 7:53 AM ET Thu, 26 July 2018 | 04:25 The country's moves in the Treasury market come amid a growing furor over Moscow's suspected meddling in the U.S. general election in 2016, which has led to sanctions on its economy. Russia's sell-off of U.S. debt in May also coincided with a jump in yields as the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield briefly touched its highest level since 2011. A Treasury Department spokesman offered the following statement to CNBC: \"The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid in the world, and demand remains robust. We do not comment on individual investors or investments.\" Though the 10-year yield has since retreated from levels above 3 percent, its movements have implications for other financial instruments like mortgages rates and auto loans, which are often based on its rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has subsequently stabilized, trading at 2.958 percent. Selling for sanctions? Bond experts like Raymond James's Kevin Giddis pointed to a flood of Treasury supply for higher long-term rates back in May. However, most of the excess likely came from historically large Treasury auctions to help pay for Washington's new tax cuts and spending bill, not Moscow's selling. \"While this liquidation by the Russians is curious, the amount they held, along with the amount they sold, is really insignificant to the multi-trillion dollar Treasury market,\" Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James, said on Sunday. \"If I had to wager, I would bet that this is part sanctions and part portfolio adjustment and little to do with a real market move,\" he added. \"If this was China or Japan, then the story would be quite different, and so the muted market movement, or lack thereof, pretty much tells the story of the move.\" The United States imposed sanctions in April on Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, a direct jab at associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a move designed to punish the country for a variety of infractions, including alleged meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. The move freezes the U.S. assets of \"oligarchs\" as well as punishes non-American individuals and companies doing business with the sanctioned entities in the same they would Americans. This is a particular potent component of the sanctions, which target aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, among others.

On Friday the company posted slightly lower-than-expected second-quarter monthly active user (MAU) numbers. But the bigger disappointment was Twitter's guidance for the third quarter, when it forecasts a decline of \"mid-single-digit millions\" in monthly users from the second quarter. Twitter shares fell 20.5 percent on Friday after the company earnings report. The stock fell another 8 percent Monday, resulting in a nearly 27 percent loss over two days. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its underperform rating for Twitter shares, citing the company's forecast for a decline in users. \"Slight 2Q beat [is] overshadowed by outlook for slowing growth,\" analyst Justin Post said in a note to clients Monday. The \"outlook suggests revenue growth rates may have peaked, monthly users could decline, and platform health initiatives will impact margins, and we would expect less ongoing optimism for continued financial upside in the stock.\" Post reiterated his $27 price target for Twitter shares, representing 21 percent downside to Friday's close. One Wall Street analyst said investors should avoid Twitter shares until user growth returns. \"We believe upside to current levels would require growth in the overall user base, which we see no evidence of at this point,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a note to clients Friday. Hargreaves reaffirmed his sector weight rating for Twitter shares and said his \"fair value\" for the stock is $32. Stifel praised Twitter management for its initiative to clean up the platform but also doesn't see much upside for its shares. \"With everything going on in the world (and with Twitter's peers), it's hard to fault Twitter for prioritizing the long-term health and viability of its platform for public conversation, but it's even more difficult to justify why investors should own the stock as it goes through this period,\" Stifel analyst John Egbert said in a note to clients Friday. Egbert reiterated his hold rating and raised his price target to $30 from $27 for Twitter shares. To be sure, not every analyst is giving up on Twitter's stock. J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth told his clients Monday to \"buy the selloff\" in Twitter shares. \"Slightly light 2Q results and the below-consensus 3Q outlook were clearly disappointing, and there is somewhat of a reset on numbers coming out of the quarter. However, we do not believe that Twitter's underlying fundamentals have changed,\" he said. Anmuth reiterated his overweight rating for Twitter shares and lowered his price target to $45 from $50 for the company's stock. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

that started last week carried through to Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 percent to 7,630. Shares of Facebook and Netflix fell 2.2 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. Amazon declined 2.1 percent while Google-parent Alphabet fell 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq also notched a three-day drop of 3.86 percent, its biggest since late March, when it lost 5.12 percent over three sessions. The S&P 500 declined 0.6 percent to 2,802.60 as the tech sector dropped 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 144.23 points to close at 25,306.83 as Visa and American Express lagged. Tech shares dove last week after Facebook dropped 19 percent Thursday on reporting weaker-than-expected revenue and lowering its revenue growth forecast. Facebook's massive drop sent the tech sector down 1.15 percent last week. \"The guys at the top don't stay there forever,\" said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. \"I don't see anyone displacing them right now, but they do have to make changes to their business models. For example, Facebook has to spend more money to make sure people aren't abusing the platform. Investors like more money, not less.\" Spencer Platt | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on July 12, 2018 in New York City. Twitter shares dropped 8 percent and were the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 tech sector. Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts and Akamai Technologies pulled back 7.7 percent, 5.7 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Trade worries also rattled investors on Monday after Reuters reported that Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico and South Korea will meet next week to discuss a response to threats made by President Donald Trump about slapping tariffs on U.S. auto imports. \"I think the market is headed for jittery times,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. \"Those tariffs are showing up in earnings reports and eventually will hit the consumer. Once that happens, consumer sentiment will dampen.\" Tyson Foods lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast, citing uncertainty around trade policies and tariffs. Shares of Tyson Foods dropped more than 7.5 percent. Meanwhile, Caterpillar said in its second-quarter earnings report that recently imposed tariffs will shave off between $100 million and $200 million from its bottom line in the second half. The company also reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year outlook, however. Wall Street looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled to start Tuesday. Market expectations for a rate hike are just 3 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, but investors will look for clues on the central bank's path toward normalizing policy. \"The Fed has said it expects to raise rates twice more this year,\" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \"If you look at the probability markets, most people in the market expect at least one more rate hike. It is the second one investors seem to be split on.\" \"Anything that provides some clarity on that would be helpful,\" Keon said. Treasury yields rose ahead of the meeting on Monday, with the 10-year yield hitting 2.99 percent, its highest level since June 13. American Express shares fell 2.9 percent after The Wall Street Journal that the company lured small business customers with low foreign exchange conversion rates only to raise rates later without notifying them. Visa fell 3 percent after Kroger said its California subsidiary will stop accepting Visa credit cards, citing high payment fees and rates.

The so-called FANG stocks fell Monday after disappointing quarterly results from two of the top companies in the sector. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet all ended in red to start the trading week, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its biggest 3-day loss since March. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.4 percent lower, Facebook finished 2.1 percent lower, while Netflix ended Monday down 5.7 percent. Amazon and Google parent Alphabet dropped 1.8 and 2 percent, respectively. Apple, which is sometimes added to the group to make it \"FAANG,\" closed 0.5 percent lower. FANG is an acronym for high-performing technology stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) \u2014 that have led the bull run of the last 9 years. Facebook had its worst day as a public company last week, dropping 20 percent and shedding roughly $120 billion in market value Thursday following a disastrous second-quarter report. The company missed revenue and active userprojections following data leaks and fake news scandals. The stock is down 13 percent this month. Netflix also disappointed Wall Street. The company reported second-quarter results that missed analysts' expectations for new subscribers for the first time in five quarters. The stock fell more than 5 percent following the report and is down about 13 percent for the month. Some Wall Street strategists say the disappointments in growth names, with the addition of Apple, could shift the market more toward value stocks. \"Of the five FAANG stocks that have reported, two have flopped along with a few other high growth/high momentum names and this group is coming under pressure,\" Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis said in a note to clients Monday. \"We think this presents us with the catalyst to shift toward value and valuations mattering.\" Morgan Stanley also predicted a shift toward value and pointed to industrials as a sector with \"relative upside.\" \"We viewed Friday's moves as a sign of market exhaustion and think shift toward value could be more sustainable,\" Michael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients Monday. \"With Amazon's strong quarter out of the way and a very strong 2Q GDP number, investors were finally faced with the question of 'what do I look forward to now?'\" On Thursday, Amazon reported a huge beat on profits but a slight miss on revenue for its second-quarter results. Goldman Sachs' chief strategist took the opposite view on the tech stocks, and said Facebook's disappointing results shouldn't scare investors out of the entire sector. Even after the drops Monday, most of the FANG stocks are up so far this year. Netflix is still up more than 77 percent year-to-date followed by Amazon's 54 percent year-to-date gain. Facebook is the lone loser, down 4.6 percent this year. Tech stocks are still the best performers in 2018, and the sector is up 14.1 percent compared with the overall S&P 500 index, which is up 5.4 percent this year. Apple reports earnings Tuesday after the bell.

Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that President Donald Trump's tax cuts, along with some of his other efforts, have helped out the U.S. economy. \"Presidents get a lot of credit [and] a lot of blame for things they didn't do, but the president has done things which accelerated growth,\" Dimon told CNBC's Wilfred Frost on \"Closing Bell.\" \"We needed competitive taxes. The way the American public should be thinking of it is: For 20 years, we've been increasingly uncompetitive, driving capital and brains overseas.\" Dimon also said some of the regulatory rollbacks pushed by Trump are helping small businesses. \"We've had less small business formation in America than in any other recovery,\" he said. \"This has accelerated the growth. It's been 20 percent over 10 years; it should've been 40. The reason it wasn't 40 is because of a lot of things that we did hurt ourselves.\" Dimon's comments come after the Commerce Department said Friday the U.S. economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter. That marked the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014, when the economy expanded by 4.9 percent. Late last year, Trump signed a bill that lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Trump also eased or rolled back last year several pieces of regulation he felt were hurting U.S. businesses. But Dimon said he is concerned that Trump's trade policies could be a headwind to the U.S. economic expansion, noting: \"I think it could offset some of the benefits\" of the tax overhaul and other measures. The Trump administration has taken an increasingly protectionist stance on trade recently. Earlier this month, the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods. The U.S. has also implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. They have retaliated against those levies with tariffs of their own.

AT&T's merger with Time Warner, combined with better-than-expected wireless business trends and a lower corporate tax rate, presents a compelling opportunity for investors, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Analysts at the brokerage upgraded shares of the telecommunications giant to buy from neutral on Monday, advising clients to pick up the \"new and improved AT&T\" at record low price to earnings levels. \"AT&T is fundamentally sound, with a stable subscription-based business model,\" analyst David Barden said in a note. \"Historically, the stock has outperformed during periods of M&A and wireless margin expansion fueled EPS growth and during periods of market uncertainty when AT&T's dividend yield and predictable business model are highly valued.\" Barden maintained his price target of $37 (representing 19 percent upside from Friday's close), but revised higher his 2018 revenue and earnings per shares forecasts to $170.57 billion and $3.56, up from his prior estimates of $153.86 billion and $3.36 respectively. Shares of AT&T rose 2.96 percent on Monday following the optimistic Bank of America note. Much of the increase to the sales and earnings numbers, the analyst said, was a direct result of AT&T's merger with Time Warner, where investors can expect positive momentum in wireless, improved margin performance in entertainment and seasonal strength in Warner Media. The cash and stock merger deal, worth roughly $81 billion, closed on June 14 after U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected the Department of Justice's attempt to thwart the deal. \"We expect AT&T to file pro forma financial statements in the coming weeks which should improve Street models (which we believe are generally too low) and add conviction to numbers,\" Barden added. \"We have seen super-normal trading volumes recede and we believe the overhang of potential incremental Time Warner shareholder selling is now behind us.\" The DOJ has appealed Leon's ruling but the analyst isn't worried. \"One legal counsel we consulted with believes that there is only a thin chance the DoJ is able win its appeal let alone unwind the deal,\" stated the note. \"They believe that arguments will likely be held in November with a ruling in late December or early January. On that basis, at this point it appears the appeal is more of a headline risk than actual fundamental risk.\" Barden also noted that when he downgraded AT&T just over a year ago, there was \"greatly diminished\" conviction that corporate tax reform would be accomplished in 2017. Now, with President Donald Trump's landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a corporate rate pared to 21 percent, AT&T is generating an extra $3 billion of annual free cash flow while earnings have received a persistent 20 percent benefit.

Shares of Tyson fell 7.6 percent to a 52-week low Monday after the food company cut its full-year guidance on trade worries related to the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs and a turbulent commodities market. The international food company now expects adjusted earnings for fiscal year 2018 at approximately $5.70 to $6.00, down from a range of $6.55 to $6.70. \"The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,\" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer. \"We will continue to watch these conditions carefully.\" The company, which raises and processes chicken, pork, beef and prepared foods, detailed its reasons for providing investors with an update for the fiscal year in a press release dated July 30. According to the document, the primary drivers for the reduced guidance are: \"Uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs negatively impacting domestic and export prices - primarily chicken and pork\"\"Increased volatility in the commodity markets resulting in a greater than expected increase in the domestic supply of proteins and lower sales prices\"\"Sluggish domestic chicken demand due to such pricing of competing proteins\"\"Pork margin compression driven by an imbalance in supply and demand\"\"A benefit from tax reform of about $0.77 per share vs. a previous projection of $0.85 cents per share.\" The United States has been embroiled in a growing tit-for-tat trade war in recent months as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to force economic partners like China, Mexico and the European Union into more favorable trade deals. Following the White House's decision to slap duties on imported steel and aluminum, however, Mexico imposed a 10 percent tariff on chilled and frozen pork muscle cuts, which took effect June 5 and doubled to 20 percent earlier this month. Such tariffs have had a direct impact on the American agricultural sector as foreign governments take aim Republican-heavy electoral regions in an effort to pressure lawmakers into opposing Trump's actions. China, meanwhile, started collecting an additional 25 percent import duty on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to President Trump's actions against Beijing for intellectual property theft. The country's retaliatory measures include tariffs on soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, whiskey and dairy. Nearly $20 billion in U.S. agricultural exports went to China last year, with the more than half of that amount coming from soybeans. One in 4 hogs raised in the U.S. is sold overseas, and the Chinese are the world's top consumers of pork.

Brown | AFP | Getty Images A motorist drives past shipping containers, including one from China Shipping, awaiting transportation at the Port of Long Beach on July 12, 2018 in Long Beach, California. Washington's apparent shift of emphasis from its unassailable trade argument to an uncertain legal battle about China's foreign trade policies and practices looks like an own goal. Upon reflection, Washington could soon recover. Some own goals during the recent World Cup ultimately led to a win. By its size and complexity, the trade deficit with China is, arguably, one of the most acute problems ever encountered in American economic history. Its solution requires a bilateral agreement to rapidly and drastically narrow that trade gap \u2014 which stands at hundreds of billions of dollars. But linking trade with a wide web of U.S.-China political and security issues should be vigorously resisted. Indeed, attempts to place an unwinnable trade dispute with the U.S. in a broader geopolitical context is a road to nowhere. There is no meaningful constituency to support China's systematic \u2014 and growing \u2014 trade surpluses with the U.S. And there is no way that Washington's efforts to stop that can be construed as a destruction of the multilateral trading system. Given a hopelessly unbalanced world economy, that multilateral system is just a pious wish. Play by the rules The White House is trying to defend its economy from long-standing abuses of the post-WWII world order. Some countries continue to ignore the rules of international trade adjustment, enshrined in the International Monetary Fund's original Articles of Agreement, and in constant calls by the Group of 20 (the world's main economic forum) for a balanced global economy. Countries like China, that have a huge trade surplus, will have to reckon with that. Alleged obstructions to market access and violations of intellectual property rules are only part of the problem. An equally serious issue is that countries with large and systematic trade surpluses are also running inappropriate economic policies. By deliberately producing much more than they are consuming \u2014 and dumping huge excess supplies on the rest of the world \u2014 the surplus countries are, by design, export-driven economies living off their trade partners. That's why the architects of the post-war global economic system introduced symmetric trade adjustment rules applying to surplus and deficit countries alike. Under those rules, surplus countries have to stimulate growth through domestic means \u2014 such as household consumption, public spending, residential investments and business capital expenditures \u2014 rather than exports. By doing that, they are expected to boost import demand, reduce their external surpluses and offset restrictive economic policies in deficit countries to keep the world economy growing. Beijing knows that. Its huge surpluses on U.S. trades have a depressive impact on the American economy (they are a subtraction from the U.S. GDP growth), but they serve as a big stimulus to the Chinese economy (they are an addition to China's GDP growth). Clearly, there is no win-win here. China's rhetoric to portray America's trade complaint as anything but legitimate is propaganda. The simple truth is that the global balance of payments needs to be balanced \u2014 that means it must be equal to zero (adjusted for minor measurement errors) \u2014 and there is no American hegemony or unfair advantage in that particular economic concept. China owes a lot to the US Current account surplus countries such as China, Japan and South Korea are getting richer by accumulating net foreign assets, including the huge and well remunerated claims on the United States. By contrast, America is getting poorer with $8 trillion, and counting, of net foreign liabilities. How can anyone blame the White House for trying to put an immediate end to that decades-old mismanagement of the U.S. economy? Perhaps China should give a thought to that. Another consideration is that China's huge domestic and foreign investments come, in large part, from the money it earns on its export sales to America. In other words, China is recycling its U.S. trade surpluses in the form of soaring investments around the world. Is that President Xi Jinping's \"win-win cooperation\" that should serve as a founding principle of China's \"community with a shared future for mankind\" that he talked about at the BRICS Business Forum in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week? I doubt that he can sell that even to his good friend President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The two men had a full-court bilateral summit with their top advisors last Thursday on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting, before sharing a private dinner. Russians, too, are concerned about the balance of their bilateral trade with China that could approximate $100 billion by the end of this year. That, of course, pales in significance to a U.S.-China $636 billion goods trade last year, where $505.6 billion represented Chinese exports to America. So, what now? A rational government should call for China to balance its trade accounts with the U.S. Beijing would probably do well to promptly initiate that process on its own because the current situation cannot continue and there is nothing to gain by dragging things out. Washington, for its part, should treat China, and its leaders, with respect. China, like any other country, can be called out \u2014 within the appropriate WTO committees \u2014 for suspected trade violations, but the White House cannot keep blaming China for decades-long wealth and technology transfers at the U.S. expense. The blame is with previous administrations that unforgivably mismanaged trade relations with China. Investment thoughts It would be in China's interest to move toward squaring its trade books with the U.S. Sadly, I am not holding my breath for that. Judging by China's policy statements in the last week or so, the U.S.-China relationship looks like it's already settled at zero trust and irretrievable hostility. China, however, should think again if it counts on the EU support to confront America in trade and other disputes. Beijing may also be miscalculating if it expects that Trump could give up his trade claims in the run-up to November elections. The opposite may be more likely because a trade scuffle with China could be his bipartisan rallying point. Investment strategists can assign a negligibly low probability to the U.S.-EU trade war. But, on current evidence, a trade war \u2014 or worse \u2014 with China is a distinct possibility.

According to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's Paul Ciana, there are two particular charts that point to an oil breakout that could garner solid returns over the next 6 to 12 months. The firm's chief global technical strategist's first chart compares commodity prices to bond prices. \"You'll see that there is this big head and shoulders up here in that ratio,\" the firm's chief global technical strategist said Thursday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"Earlier this year, that ratio broke down below that neckline.\" But now, Ciana said, that ratio has corrected back up to the resistance pocket \u2014 a move that makes a compelling case for commodity prices to rise. \"This is the exact technical point where market participants should be shorting bonds and going long commodities, especially if this relationship is going to hold up and remain true which, of course, I think so,\" he said. Bond prices, particularly the 10-Year Treasury Note, have been under pressure as yields climb. They've been facing headwinds as central banks around the world raising interest rates and ending quantitative easing programs. Ciana's second chart shows the strength of WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil. Even though the price has softened over the past five trading sessions, the commodity has rallied almost 7 percent over the last six weeks. It's now bouncing around $69 a barrel. \"There's still a strong trend line here that's still in place suggesting that the trend is, in fact, higher,\" he said \u2014 highlighting that the 100-day moving average is holding as support in an upward sloping channel. Ciana, who sees WTI \"accelerating into the $77s,\" called the current level a low risk entry point to buy oil. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Morgan Chase, is bullish on the U.S. economy, which is in the latter stages of one of the longest expansions in history. But when asked Monday on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" what the single biggest risk to the economy is, Dimon had two answers. First, the U.S. trade dispute with China, if it escalates into a full-blown war, would erase much of the progress the Trump administration has made, he said. And then there's the unwinding of unprecedented efforts by central banks around the world a decade after the 2008 financial crisis. Dubbed \"quantitative easing,\" the Federal Reserve and other central banks purchased trillions of dollars of government bonds and other securities to help nurse the economy back to health. They are now starting to reverse course. Dimon told CNBC that he is concerned about what happens when that support is pulled back. \"I don't want to scare the public, but we've never had QE,\" Dimon said. \"We've never had the reversal. Regulations are different. Monetary transmission is different. Governments have borrowed too much debt, and people can panic when things change.\" Dimon, 62, has also previously warned of the possibility that the Fed will have to hike interest rates faster than expected, slamming the brakes on growth. The recurring theme: policymakers are in uncharted waters. Adding to the risk is the fact that the administration is looking at imposing another round of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Dimon said Monday that he told the administration that he and other business leaders disagreed on the tactics, but that President Donald Trump \"obviously doesn't agree with us.\" show chapters JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon on Trump's trade policies 5:15 PM ET Mon, 30 July 2018 | 02:22 Dimon is the longest tenured of CEOs leading a major U.S. bank. Once his friend, Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein, steps down in October, he will also be the only bank CEO still working to have steered his firm through the financial crisis. Given Dimon's record, investors and analysts often track his every word, from media appearances to conferences to his annual investor letter. Dimon said Monday that he and J.P. Morgan's board believes there are several executives who could eventually succeed him as CEO in about five years. Apart from the trade dispute and QE unwind, Dimon has been consistently optimistic about the strength of the U.S. economy and the prospects for banks. During a conference call with analysts this month after posting record second-quarter profit of $8.32 billion, he said there weren't a lot of things out there that could derail growth, which has been accelerating. \"Finally, people are going back to the workforce,\" Dimon said. \"The consumer balance sheet is in good shape. Capital expenditures are going up. Household formation is going up. Homebuilding is in short supply. The banking system is very, very healthy compared to the past.\" "}, {"urlToImage":

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 1.37 percent lower on Monday to 7,630, with Twitter as its biggest loser, falling 8 percent. The Nasdaq's losses represent the biggest three-day loss since March. Other FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, formerly known as Google) also closed lower. Facebook was down 2.1 percent, after falling 20 percent Thursday. That drop, following the second-quarter earnings report, was the biggest loss for any company in stock market history.

Kelley maintained his price target of $31, representing 1 percent downside from Monday's close. Twitter's stock on Friday suffered its single worst day since 2014 after the company reported a decline in monthly active users \u2014 a key metric used to gauge engagement \u2013 and offered anemic guidance. Shares fell more than 20 percent on Friday and 8 percent on Monday, but closed up 1.5 percent Tuesday. Shares are off more than 33 percent from their 52-week high notched in mid-June. The social media company reported 335 million monthly active users, down from 336 million in the prior quarter, blaming not moving to paid SMS carrier relationships in certain markets, some impact from new regulatory rules in Europe, and efforts to improve the \"health\" of the platform. \"Monthly active user patterns have been harder to estimate with ongoing efforts to clean up the platform,\" Kelley wrote. \"This makes intuitive sense as \"real\" people (as opposed to fake accounts/bots) are likely to be active on a more consistent basis, but it makes understanding the moving pieces a bit harder to monitor and model.\" Despite Twitter's efforts to purge fake accounts from the site to improve the platform and protect users from misinformation, the company's revenue grew 24 percent year over year with strong advertising gains.

Credit Suisse reported Tuesday a net income of 647 million Swiss francs ($655.33 million) for the second quarter of the year. The figure beat analysts' expectations, which had pointed to a net income around 550 million Swiss francs. It is also more than double the level seen a year ago, when net income was 303 million Swiss francs. Nonetheless, the bank's performance came in slightly lower from what it had reported during the first quarter of the year, when net income stood at 694 million Swiss francs. show chapters Credit Suisse doubles second-quarter profit, beating expectations 2:31 AM ET Tue, 31 July 2018 | 02:15 Here are some of the highlights for the second quarter: Net income: 647 million Swiss francs ($655 million)Net revenues: 5.6 billion Swiss francs ($5.57 billion)CET1 ratio: 12.8 percent Tidjane Thiam, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse, said the second quarter of 2018 \"was a period of continued strong performance as we achieved our highest adjusted pre-tax income in the last 12 quarters.\" \"For the remainder of 2018, we will continue to focus on growing our wealth management franchise and completing the last two quarters of our restructuring successfully,\" he said in a statement.

He seemed particularly positive about the bank's wealth management division, which brought in net revenues of 1.34 billion Swiss francs, higher than the 1.26 billion reported a year ago.

Last weekend, the \"Overwatch\" League's Grand Finals sold out at New York's Barclays Center. Seymour pointed to the participation of large-scale media companies as proof of a growing industry: The Walt Disney Company broadcast the \"Overwatch\" games on ESPN. \"The fan base is rabid,\" said Seymour, who is also a CNBC contributor. \"The excitement is there. And it's all demographics. It's not just guys. It's not just girls. It's not just young folks. It's old folks.\" In fact, the video game industry is booming with more products and tournaments popping up around the world. According to a 2018 esports report by Newzoo, a market research firm, about 2.3 billion gamers worldwide will spend about $137.9 billion on games this year. That figure represents a 13.3 percent jump from a year ago \u2014 or an increase of $16.2 billion. The market research firm tracks usage and trends in esports, video games and mobile. \"Esports, what makes it so special is that it is a global thing. You can compete anywhere,\" Alex Mendez, an esports commentator and league host for \"Overwatch,\" told CNBC, pointing out that there are games and leagues around the globe. Mendez said he started playing video games after giving up football. \"And then I just decided: I'm going to transition this into a career,\" he told CNBC. \"But that's when everything was so small. Now we're selling out Barclays Center. That is just mind-blowing.\" Frederic J.

Jack Etienne, owner of esports team the London Spitfire, said he made about a million dollars from the \"Overwatch\" event \u2014 the prize for the winning team. Investors can get into the esports space with the purchase of teams and video game platforms, Etienne said. They can also invest in products or video content that enhance the user experience, such as virtual reality, he said. \"Overwatch\" was developed by Blizzard Entertainment, an entertainment software and video games publisher and maker owned by Activision Blizzard, which has a market cap of more than $55 billion. The media company is set to release second quarter earnings results Thursday after the bell. Activision closed 3.46 percent down on Monday, but shares were still priced at more than $72, compared with nearly $62 a year ago or about $17 five years ago. Privately held Epic Games, developer of last year's \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" game, announced recently that it had made more than $1 billion from in-game revenue, according to data from market research firm SuperData. The game is free to download and play, but sells features during the game such as extra costumes.

In September, it is expected that the Federal Reserve will raise the Federal Funds rate one more time. Many believe that the agency will raise rates again in December and possibly two to three times in 2019 until the rate is in the area of 3 percent. These actions will be directly contrary to the stated wishes of President Donald Trump and hints made public by his chief economic advisor. The rate increases will also ignore the fears of some district Federal Reserve Bank Presidents like James Bullard in St. Louis and Neel Kashkari in Minneapolis. The issue here is whether the Fed will be inverting the yield curve creating a recession. Therefore, the elements are in place for another epic battle concerning control of the Federal Reserve. In the beginning, this conflict may stay at the surface level but it is quite possible that it will delve more deeply into core issues related to the institution's real function and purpose. That battle was begun under President Andrew Jackson and continues to the present. Fighting forces within the Fed In her fascinating book entitled \"Fed Up,\" ex-Fed insider Danielle DiMartino Booth relates that \"she was shocked to discover just how much tunnel vision, arrogance, liberal dogmas, and abuse of power drove the policies of the Fed.\" The book goes on to argue that \"\u2026 a cabal of unelected academics \u2026 made decisions without the slightest understanding of the real world; just a slavish devotion to their theoretical models.\" She is referring to the years following 2008. My personal experience with the Fed is certainly not close to that of Booth, but it was not contrary to her findings. For a number of years now, I have noted that the monetary thrusts being made by the Fed were being defeated by the regulatory thrusts made by the organization. On the two occasions when I went to Washington to ask why this was happening, the answer I received was two-fold: The regulators make their decisions in order to resolve the problems in the banking system and the monetary authorities make their decisions related to the broader needs of the economy. I received no confirmation that these two groups within the Fed coordinated their actions to develop a consensus as to what would be best for the economy. The net result is that the monetarists authorized three quantitative easings from 2008 to 2012, while the regulatory authorities kept raising the capital requirements of the banks. The net result was lower interest rates, which raised the value of financial assets, but there were no increases in bank loans that could have stimulated economic growth. The FDIC tells us from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2014 loan growth in the United States was negative 0.5 percent \u2013 not per year but for the total six years. Jacksonian revolt Taking a deeper dive, consider these two figures: From the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2018 bank loans grew by 2 percent per year; the S&P 500 grew by 7.2 percent annually, excluding dividends. These numbers are at the heart of the Jacksonian revolt against the Second Bank of the United States. Their argument was that the Northeasterners were controlling money supply for their own benefit starving the west and south from receiving funds and, therefore, from growth. When the creation of the Federal Reserve was being debated, the same argument was used and Jackson's name was constantly evoked. Only by then the argument focused on Wall Street. The considerable opposition to the creation of the Fed was led by notables like William Jennings Bryan, who argued that Wall Street would control the funds in the United States, starving the west and the south and rewarding the Northeasterners on Wall Street. If either Jackson or Bryan had seen the two stats above related to loans and the stock market they would probably been apoplectic. They would clearly argue \"I told you so.\" Hamilton, Jefferson Fast forward to today, the two Fed Bank Presidents who are raising concern about an inverted yield curve and recession are by no coincidence from the very areas that Jackson and Bryan considered to be the west and the south. The President's core supporters are in the west and the south \u2013 not on Wall Street or New York or Massachusetts. President Trump's fear is that further increases in interest rates could slow economic growth presumably in the west and the south. He may have a good case to make. Year-over-year growth in the money supply at 3.9 percent is the trending back to the Volcker years. Actually, in the past three months, money supply growth (M2 NSA) has been zero. Thus, the battle concerning the nature of the United States financial system, which actually started with Alexander Hamilton (need central banking) and Thomas Jefferson (banks are inherently evil) could easily start again. The data suggests that the Fed may need fixing.

At the start of 2018, many analysts we spoke to on our show were positive about European cyclicals, especially financials after what was a bumper fourth quarter for the continent's economic data. With a strong beta to underlying growth, as well as relatively cheap valuations to U.S. counterparts, what was not to love? It seems quite a lot. The long financials play has unfortunately not worked out the way many had been hoping for. The sector is one of the worst performing in Europe this year, down more than 9 percent. No doubt a good part of that is down to positioning in the space, that also happened to coincide with a slowdown in economic data and renewed dovishness out of the European Central Bank, which has since dispelled any hopes of rate hikes for at least another 12 months \u2014 and therefore a headwind for the interest rate-sensitive banking sector. In the last three months, investors have pulled cash away from the continent, first due to political concerns, such as in Italy and Germany, and then trade concerns, such as tariffs. But, interestingly, banks have been the hardest hit \u2014 even more so than autos. But has the time come to dip toes back in again? We are about midway through the European earnings season. According to Deutsche Bank research, the best earning per share growth surprises so far have been exhibited by financials, with analysts expecting even further earnings growth in the third quarter. The average price-to-book among European banks is just shy of 1, versus around 1.6 for U.S. equivalents, albeit with a lower return on equity. So, from a valuation standpoint, the temptation is there. Ali Miremadi, investment director at GAM, recently told CNBC that in today's environment, it's less about the macro and more about picking the banks with the right strategy and the ability to deliver on cost-cutting measures. He cited Unicredit as being one bank that has managed to increase revenue, cut costs and maintain its capital position \u2014 yet is still very undervalued. show chapters Why UniCredit stands out among European banks, according to one investor 7:54 AM ET Fri, 27 July 2018 | 03:36 Almost every CEO I have interviewed in the last couple of quarters has emphasized this point: the number one priority is bringing down costs and investors are quick to punish those who are not delivering quickly enough. Deutsche Bank stands out there. Skeptics also point to ongoing extra capacity in the space and much-needed consolidation. We are already beginning to see activity there, both in cross-border, with Commerzbank selling part of its equities business to Societe Generale, and domestically, with Spanish banking consolidation being a good example. On redefining strategy, no segment exemplifies the shift in thinking better than Swiss banks, which, after a long experiment with the more volatile investment banking and capital markets business have collectively refocused back into private banking. The results are paying off, particularly as these banks make a push into Asia. The objective has shifted away from high return on an equity, leveraged model, to a \"stable and steady\" fee-generating model, or as Miremadi summarized, \"Regulators have achieved their aim of making European banks boring.\" After years of negative surprises, perhaps it's time to make boring great again.

Leading cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase is beefing up its compliance team as part of an effort to legitimize the asset class in the eyes of cautious regulators and institutional investors. The San Francisco-based start-up announced Tuesday it will hire Jeff Horowitz as its first-ever chief compliance officer. Horowitz was managing director and global head of compliance at Pershing, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon specializing in brokerage custody, clearing and settlement. \"As Coinbase \u2014 along with the cryptocurrency space as a whole \u2014 grows and matures, continued regulatory compliance across all the varying jurisdictions globally will be critical,\" Coinbase President and Chief Operating Officer Asiff Hirji said in a blog post Tuesday. \"Adding Jeff to our team is one more important step along this journey.\" Before Pershing, Horowitz led compliance and anti-money laundering programs at Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Salomon Brothers, and was a banking regulator with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As one of the biggest digital currency platforms, Coinbase was in the right place at the right time as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000, mostly from retail investors, in 2017. Since then, bitcoin is down more than 60 percent, according to data from industry site CoinDesk. Despite the crypto bear market, Coinbase has been reinvesting its gains in everything from institutional investor products, to acquisitions, including a fully licensed broker-dealer. Risk-averse institutional investors have been especially wary of potential hazards that come with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has nosedived roughly 50 percent this year after regulatory crackdowns on fundraising frauds, high-profile hacks and a lack of new buyers. U.S. regulators have been equally cautious about the risks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has cracked down on fraud in initial coin offerings, and recently declined to approve what would have been the first-ever bitcoin ETF, highlighting issues of market manipulation and investor protection. Coinbase has also poached key executives from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and the New York Stock Exchange this year. The company landed at the No. 10 spot on the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, and reportedly valued itself at about $8 billion when it set out to buy Earn.com, according to Recode. That was much higher than a valuation of $1.6 billion at its last round of venture capital financing in summer 2017.

Malkiel, professor emeritus of economics at Princeton University, speaks at the John C. Bogle Legacy Forum in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2012. Investing pioneer Burton Malkiel believes investors shouldn't worry too much about a key recession indicator \u2014 the so-called the flattening yield curve. \"Recently, the curve has become noticeably flatter, with short-term rates rising and longer yields remaining stagnant. This has led many analysts to think that the curve will soon invert. But that does not mean a recession is imminent,\" Malkiel said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Monday. \"There appear to be few speculative excesses in the economy. Moreover, even if the Fed pushed short-term rates another percentage point higher, monetary policy would remain broadly accommodative.\" Malkiel is the chief investment officer of Wealthfront, a Princeton professor of economics and author of \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street,\" an the investment classic that sparked the shift toward low-cost passive index investing. When the yield on the shorter duration 2-year Treasury note rises above the longer duration 10-year bond, it is seen as a recession warning. An inverted yield curve has proven to be a reliable indicator over the years. On Tuesday, the 10-year yield traded at 2.964 percent, while the 2-year note yielded 2.669 percent. The yield curve has reached some of its flattest levels since before the financial crisis, sparking worries about the economy. The spread between 2-year and 10-year yields is currently around 29 basis points, down from about 95 basis points a year ago. But Malkiel noted the European Central bank and the Bank of Japan have more dovish monetary policies than the Federal Reserve, which may be a reason for the higher 10-year bond demand. \"These yields have made U.S. Treasury bonds extremely attractive, especially since the dollar has been increasing in value,\" he said. \"Low long-term rates in this environment may emit a different signal than has been the case in the past.\" As a result, he said investors shouldn't be too concerned over the flattening yield curve. \"I do not mean to imply that we have nothing to worry about with respect to either the economy or the stock market. The prospect of a global trade war should make us very cautious,\" he said. \"But a flat yield curve, or even an inverted one, should not be on top of our worry list under today's accommodative monetary conditions.\" See here for the full Wall Street Journal op-ed. \u2014CNBC's Thomas Franck contributed to this report.

Euro zone growth slows Market sentiment had been dented by economic data showing the euro area grew only 0.3 percent in the second quarter of the year from the first quarter. According to the region's statistical office, this was due to concerns over international trade amid higher tariffs and barriers. In terms of inflation, prices rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2 percent in June, the Eurostat said Tuesday. The surge in prices was mostly due to higher energy costs, which are deemed temporary. Earlier, data released in France, showed prices surging to 2.6 percent over a year in July \u2014 the highest level on record since March 2016. In other news, Brexit worries for the U.K.'s automotive industry remain in the spotlight after the boss of the country's automobile industry group said that no-deal was \"just not an option\" for the sector.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive officer of Qualcomm Inc., holds the new Snapdragon 835 chip during a keynote at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Qualcomm said Tuesday it will begin a specialty auction to repurchase up to $10 billion of its shares, a move to salvage shareholder value after a failed merger with Dutch semiconductor firm NXP. Shares of Qualcomm closed Tuesday trading up 3.3 percent at $64.09 per share. The company announced the share repurchase will be a \"modified Dutch auction,\" a process that allows shareholders to declare the number of shares they sell and the price at which they sell them. The buyback comes after Qualcomm announced plans during its third-quarter earnings call to repurchase as much as $30 billion in stock this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The repurchase program, previously announced in May as targeting $10 billion in repurchasing, comes after Qualcomm's $44 billlion bid to acquire NXP fell apart due to regulatory roadblocks. Qualcomm first proposed the purchase of rival NXP in October 2016 and received eight of nine international approvals needed to close the deal. Its bid was formally called off last week when the company's self-imposed deadline expired before receiving approval from Chinese regulators. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told CNBC last week that the deal \"got caught up\" in the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, and that the company was committed to protecting shareholder value. Read the company's full press release below: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) announced today that it commenced a \"modified Dutch auction\" tender offer to purchase up to $10 billion of shares of its common stock, or such lesser number of shares of its common stock as are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, at a price not less than $60.00 nor greater than $67.50 per share of common stock, to the seller in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest (the \"Offer\"). The Offer is made upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the offer to purchase and in the related letter of transmittal. The closing price of Qualcomm's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on July 30, 2018, the last full trading day before the commencement of the Offer, was $62.04 per share. The Offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on August 27, 2018, unless the Offer is extended.Qualcomm believes that the Offer represents an efficient mechanism to provide Qualcomm's stockholders with the opportunity to tender all or a portion of their stock and thereby receive a return of some or all of their investment in Qualcomm if they so elect. The Offer provides stockholders with an opportunity to obtain liquidity with respect to all or a portion of their stock without the potential disruption to Qualcomm's stock price.This Offer is the first step in a broader stock repurchase program that may include future open market transactions and/or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Qualcomm expects to execute on a substantial portion of its authorized $30 billion stock repurchase program by the end of fiscal year 2019.The Offer is not contingent upon obtaining any financing. However, the Offer is subject to a number of other terms and conditions, which are described in detail in the offer to purchase. Specific instructions and a complete explanation of the terms and conditions of the Offer will be contained in the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and the related materials, which will be mailed to stockholders of record shortly after commencement of the Offer.None of Qualcomm, the members of its Board of Directors, the dealer manager, the information agent or the depositary makes any recommendation as to whether any stockholder should participate or refrain from participating in the Offer or as to the price or prices at which stockholders may choose to tender their shares in the Offer. \u2014CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.

Stocks rose on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. and China are seeking talks to defuse an escalating trade conflict between the two countries. Equities also posted their biggest monthly gains since the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 108.36 points to close at 25,415.19, with 3M, Caterpillar and Pfizer as the best-performing stocks in the index. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 2,816.29 as industrials rose more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 percent to 7,671.79. Bloomberg News reported that the world's largest economies are trying to restart talks in order to avoid a full-blown trade war. The report, which cites two people familiar with the situation, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are talking privately about the matter. Mnuchin told CNBC last week \"there continue to be some quiet conversations\" regarding China. \"It's just an agreement to have talks. We don't know where the talks go or whether they will be fruitful. They seem to be resuming high-level talks. We'll have to see what comes of it,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Shares of big exporters Boeing and Caterpillar jumped 1.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, on the report. Deere's stock also gained nearly 5 percent. Tuesday was the last trading day of July, and the major averages posted solid monthly gains. The Dow and S&P 500 rose 4.7 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, their biggest monthly gains since January. The Dow gained 5.8 percent in January, while the S&P 500 rose 5.6 percent that month. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, climbed more than 2 percent in July and notched its fourth straight monthly gain. Equities have gotten a boost this month from strong corporate earnings and positive economic data. The Commerce Department said on Friday the U.S. economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, notching its fastest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014. The economy got a boost from strong consumer and business spending as well as a surge in exports. About 60 percent of the S&P 500 has released its latest quarterly results, with 82 percent of those companies posting better-than-expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \"Do you remember all the pundits who warned 1Q 2018 earnings were at their peak? Well, the 2Q 2018 numbers for these 299 S&P 500 companies that have reported are better than how they reported last quarter in terms of year-over-year sales and earnings growth. There are also more companies beating estimates this quarter as well,\" Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, wrote in a note. The corporate earnings season continued on Tuesday with Dow components Procter & Gamble and Pfizer reporting better-than-expected earnings. Shares of Procter were up 0.9 percent, while Pfizer's stock gained 3.5 percent. Apple, another Dow component, is scheduled to report Tuesday after the close. Spencer Platt | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange But stocks have been under pressure recently amid a steep sell-off in tech. Tech has lost 5.4 percent over the past three sessions after mixed results from some of the largest companies in the sector. Facebook reported weaker-than-expected revenue last week and disappointing global daily active users, a key metric for the company. Twitter, meanwhile, posted fewer-than-expected monthly users for the previous quarter. \"Facebook is the poster child for the recent Tech stock decline,\" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a note. \"While its competitive advantage remains robust, expected returns on capital are lower than before last week's earnings release (higher costs to fix the platform) and growth rates for capital deployed are also suspect.\" These results have led some investors to lose faith in the so-called FANG trade, which is responsible for the lion's share of the S&P 500's gains this year. They have also led to the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling at least 1 percent in three consecutive sessions. The good news for investors is the Nasdaq tends to bounce back sharply from such losses. Since the financial crisis, the Nasdaq has posted three straight losses of 1 percent or more on five occasions, according to data from Kensho. Following those drops, the Nasdaq has risen more than 5 percent over the next month, the data shows. \u2014 CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report.

And the average investor could suffer even more this time, Wilson said. \"We think a coming correction will be biggest since February, although it could very well have more of a negative impact on the average portfolio if it is centered on Tech, Discretionary, and small caps,\" the note said. Facebook shares dropped 19 percent last Thursday, a day after it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter sales and daily active user numbers, resulting in the biggest one-day market value loss for a single U.S. stock in history. Netflix shares declined 14 percent this month through Monday after the streaming giant missed subscriber expectations for its second-quarter on July 16. Wilson noted the relative valuation between growth and value stocks was only higher during the dot-com bubble. He also pointed out that the 10-year return disparity between the Russell 1000 Growth index over the Russell 1000 Value index is at its 96th percentile since 1980. \"Large Cap Growth stocks have outperformed US Large Cap Value stocks by an almost unprecedented amount over both the recent past and prior decade,\" he said. \"Fighting momentum is a difficult game but when you time it right, it can very profitable. We think one of those times is now for Growth shifting to Value.\" The S&P 500 fell more than 10 percent from its highs in late-January through early February as investors reacted to a stronger-than-expected jobs report and wage number, sparking concerns over future rising interest rates. In comparison, the market is down about 1.5 percent from its monthly high on Wednesday through Monday. The strategist reiterated his 2,750 12-month target for the S&P 500, representing 2 percent downside to Monday's close. Wilson reaffirmed his overweight ratings for utilities, energy, industrials and financials sectors, which should outperform in a more difficult market environment, he said.

The board, which made no decision about Moonves' role at the company, also said Monday afternoon that it's postponing its annual shareholder meeting, which had been scheduled for Aug. 10. Bibb, managing partner of corporate finance at Mediatech Capital Partners, said Moonves' own statement regarding The New Yorker report on Friday could be \"the final blow.\" In a statement, Moonves, who has been the CEO of the network for more than two decades and chairman of the board since 2003, said, \"I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career.\" The New Yorker's article published Friday looked at the corporate culture at CBS and allegations of sexual misconduct against Moonves between the 1980s and 2000s. Shares of CBS closed down another 5 percent Monday, on top of the 6 percent they lost Friday. Meanwhile, Wall Street analyst Tuna Amobi downgraded the stock to hold. \"There's usually a cloud that kind of lingers when you get this type of announcement,\" Amobi, who works at investment research firm CFRA, said Monday in a separate \"Power Lunch\" interview. \"If you look back, the stock hasn't really done much the last couple of years,\" he said. \"There's no questions that Les Moonves has a stellar track record. But having covered this stock, there's always this kind of disconnect between the fundamentals and the recent price action.\" Amobi said he shares the view that Moonves is unlikely to last as CEO of the company following the allegations. But he added the odds of a CBS-Viacom merger have been \"enhanced by this situation.\" Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both Viacom and CBS, wants to put them back together \u2014 a move Moonves opposes. \"Redstone is very likely to have her wish and be able to combine Viacom and CBS and then sell the combined companies,\" Bibb said. CBS and Viacom were under the same umbrella from 2000 to 2006 before they were split into separate publicly traded companies. CBS could not immediately be reached for comment.

With inflation in Japan expected to remain muted, some experts are predicting that the Bank of Japan will tweak its 10-year government bond yield target at its policy meeting that ends Tuesday. With Japan's 10-year government bond yield target now at zero percent, seven among 19 bank and asset managers polled by CNBC said the BOJ could alter that target. Such a move, part of what is referred to as its yield curve control policy, could make banks' profitability improve and possibly lead to higher inflation. Estimates for the new yield target ranged from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. \"There is increasing speculation the BOJ may tweak its yield curve control settings in part because of lower bank profitability and muted inflation in Japan,\" explained Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia who was not involved in the poll. If the BOJ does, in fact, raise its 10-year yield target, that's likely to increase profitability for banks, which benefit from a wider spread between short-term and long-term rates for arbitrage. Generally speaking, greater banking activity leads to greater economic activity and higher inflation. Japan's central bank has long wanted the country's inflation rate to hit 2 percent, but in June, it downgraded its view on inflation, saying that consumer price growth was in a range of 0.5 percent to 1 percent. Yet despite that recent downgrade, two banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan \u2014 told CNBC they anticipated the central bank could again cut its inflation target. \"To strengthen its commitment to attaining the inflation target in response to the downward revision of its inflation outlook, we expect the BoJ will introduce the forward guidance to link changes in [the 10-year] yield target to inflation threshold,\" said J.P. Morgan's Chief Economist Hiroshi Ugai. Overall, 11 of the 19 banks and asset managers polled said Japan's central bank is unlikely to make any change to its monetary policy given the weak inflation outlook. \"We believe the Bank of Japan is unlikely to announce changes to its policy in the upcoming meeting given still weak-inflation and the risk that the policy moves could trigger financial tightening (via higher rates, stronger yen and equity sell-off), none of which is conducive to getting inflation higher especially at a time when trade tensions linger,\" Qian Wang, chief economist at Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, told CNBC. The CNBC poll This is what CNBC asked the 19 banks and asset managers: Which scenario is most likely to play out at the next Bank of Japan meeting?1. Drop reference to bond buying target2. Shift interest rate target on the YCC (yes or no? If yes, how?)3. End negative interest rates4. Change ETF buying scheme (yes or no? if yes, by how much)5.

His hedge fund firm, Greenlight Capital, lost 5.4 percent in the second quarter, bringing the performance of its funds to a year-to-date loss of 18.3 percent, according to a letter obtained by CNBC. The S&P 500 gained 2.6 percent this year as of the end of June. show chapters Greenlight Capital down 18 percent year to date, 5.4 percent this quarter 4:07 PM ET Tue, 31 July 2018 | 01:39 \"Over the past three years, our results have been far worse than we could have imagined, and it's been a bull market to boot,\" Einhorn wrote in the letter to investors. \"Yes, we have made some obvious mistakes \u2013 the worst of which was not assessing that SunEdison was a fraud in 2015 \u2013 but there have been others. A number of years ago one of our investors said Amazon would surpass Apple and become the most valuable company in the world. We didn't get it then and, truthfully, we don't really get it now.\" The letter acknowledges that an unspecified number of investors have lost patience and sold out of the funds. The manager points to a number of stumbles, including investments in Brighthouse Financial, a MetLife spinoff, as well as General Motors, two of its larger positions. The letter said Greenlight had taken action \"to mitigate our problems.\" It covered its Netflix equity short position at $281.46 as the stock climbed to $391.43 during the second quarter. And it traded its Athenahealth short position so that it has not been a material loser this year, he said. Einhorn said that others have theorized that age, changed lifestyle or an unwillingness to adapt to shifting markets was the cause of his funds' underperformance. Part of the reason, though, is that his focus on value investing \u2014 buying stock of out-of-favor companies \u2014 has struggled as growth company stocks have surged. He notes in the letter that the Russell 1000 Pure Growth index has outperformed the Russell 1000 Pure Value index by 54 percent. That should eventually reverse, he wrote. \"Right now the market is telling us we are wrong, wrong, wrong about nearly everything,\" Einhorn wrote. \"And yet, looking forward from today we think this portfolio makes a lot of sense.\" \u2014 CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed reporting.

Images SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son speaks during a press conference on May 9, 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. Two weeks ago, Masayoshi Son, the Japanese billionaire who has become the talk of Silicon Valley over the past 18 months, held a dinner at the Chinese restaurant Yomeiden in Tokyo's Prince Park Tower. The meeting took place during SoftBank World, an annual conference for the Japanese telecom giant's customers and suppliers, but this was a particular audience of start-up CEOs. Each one of them had taken money from the $100 billion Vision Fund that Son administers. Son had a message for the executives staring back at him: you're now part of a family. That means you're expected to help each other out. According to people who attended, Son encouraged his investments to work together, including cutting favorable deals with each other to grow faster. The dinner then turned into a networking event, with founders talking to one another and planning future deals. Son also announced that the Vision Fund had achieved a whopping 60 percent return on investment in its first year, according to two attendees. (That number is a back-of-the-envelope calculation and hasn't been vetted with the fund's legal and compliance teams, according to a person familiar with the matter.) Earlier in the day, Son and various members of his Vision Fund team had met with many of the CEOs individually for 45 minutes to an hour. He got a status update from each one, then pushed the executives on scaling as quickly as possible. show chapters What is Softbank? 9:23 PM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 03:51 Son has been holding these gatherings almost quarterly in various locations in the U.S. and in Japan, said Stefan Heck, founder of Nauto, which retrofits commercial trucks with cameras and AI software to improve driver safety. Heck took an investment from the Vision Fund last year. Heck couldn't make the recent gathering in Tokyo but did meet with Son and attended the CEO dinner in New York at The Four Seasons on the weekend of March 26, where Son made similar comments about working with other firms in the Vision Fund family, he said. The Vision Fund officially closed a little more than a year ago with $93 billion, and has since added the last $7 billion to get to $100 billion of capital under management. It's invested in about 30 companies. The smallest investments are around $100 million in companies such as Nauto and Brain Corp, which is building self-driving \"brains\" for robots. The largest was a nearly $10 billion investment in ride-hailing giant Uber. The driving force behind the investments is Son himself. While Son has built a team of about 200 people who help him find targets and perform months of due diligence on potential targets, the 60-year old founder of Japan's third-largest wireless company (and 82 percent owner of Sprint) meets in person with every founder of every Vision Fund investment -- sometimes several times -- before reaching an agreement on a deal. This frequently involves last-minute trips to Toyko for founders who get the call -- \"Masa wants to see you tomorrow.\" While the initial meetings vary from person to person, there are some common themes driving Son's discussions and investments, according to six founders who have taken money from the Vision Fund. The conversations also illustrate how the billionaire differs from his venture capital peers in both strategy and style. Meeting Masa Those who know Son comment about his remarkable energy and desire for accomplishment. One acquaintance said his personality can be traced to growing up as a Korean in Japan, where discrimination is rampant. Growing up bullied, Son developed \"an I'll show you approach\" that he's carried throughout his life. Son has had some giant hits and misses. He was briefly the richest person on Earth in 2000 before losing 90 percent of his wealth when the dot-com bubble burst. Aided by an early investment in Alibaba, Son has built himself back and is again one of the world's wealthiest men. SoftBank, the company he founded, has a market capitalization of nearly $100 billion. But it's the Vision Fund -- $100 billion from sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and global corporations including Apple, Hon Hai and Qualcomm -- that has taken the world of technology by storm since its inception last year. The fund's rapid deployment of cash has already begun talk of a Vision Fund 2. show chapters Masa Son: This the beginning of a new ecosystem for high-tech manufacturing back in the US 2:36 PM ET Thu, 28 June 2018 | 02:28 Son often meets founders in his mansion in Woodside, California. Son made headlines in 2013 when he reportedly bought the house for $117 million, making it one of the most expensive homes ever purchased in the United States. Son's estate can't be seen from the street. Founders -- and even other members of the Vision Fund team -- describe waiting outside the gates and being escorted into his home by a security guard. Once at Son's door, a second security guard escorts the visitors into Son's house, where all guests change out of their shoes and into slippers. Son then greets his guests with a traditional Japanese bow and leads them into one of at least two conference rooms in his house. Mohit Aron, the founder of enterprise storage company Cohesity, said his conference room was designed with ornate woodwork and very large TV on which he presented his pitch to Son. \"It felt very elite,\" Aron said. Aron had already gone through about two months of thorough due diligence on his company, including speaking to executives, analysts, board members and customers. Now, he launched into a presentation that lasted about an hour. Son mostly listened but asked a couple of questions about how big Aron felt Cohesity could get. \"I actually stopped myself before I jumped to answer and thought, 'what is he really asking me?' before I answered,\" Aron said. \"I think there was a question behind the question.\" Aron guessed Son was looking for a leader of a company with very big ambitions. Fortunately for Aron, Son was satisfied with his answers. He slapped the table and said \"sort of said, 'let's do it.'\" He then shook Aron's hand \u2014 which was more than just a courtesy goodbye, Aron said. \"I sort of didn't understand the significance of the handshake in Japanese business culture,\" Aron said. \"But after, I was told the handshake means we have a deal and let's figure out the details later.\" Aron had already discussed a range of potential investments with other members of the Vision Fund, but the numbers were finalized in short order. When Aron met with Son again at SoftBank World last month, the billionaire was much more animated and full of suggestions about how Cohesity could work with his other portfolio companies. \"He was bubbly, giving advice about how SoftBank's own sales team can help us through a partnership and telling stories about how Alibaba turned itself around after being run very poorly,\" Aron said. \"The meetings were exhilarating. Most investors are a little bit cautious, a little bit greedy. With Masa, he may liquidate some of his investments but for the most part he wants to stay in the company as long as he believes in it. It's refreshing to hear.\" Aron declined to comment on how much Son invested, but a person familiar with the matter says he sold the Vision Fund a 15 percent stake in his company as part of a $250 million round. Source: Cohesity SoftBank president Masayoshi Son and Cohesity co-founder and CEO Mohit Aron Until recently, Son was not widely known among the Silicon Valley start-up set. Nauto was one of the first companies Son invested in, before the Vision Fund was closed. Heck heard Son was interested in his company through mutual acquaintance Andy Rubin, the former Google executive who created Android mobile operating system and is now a start-up investor. \"I'd vaguely heard of him,\" Heck said of Son. \"I get this call from Andy at like 4 in the afternoon. He tells me I should drop everything and fly to Japan tomorrow. I've got a calendar full of customer meetings. I'm like, 'Is this something I should do?' Andy says people wait their whole lives to get a meeting with Masa. So I canceled everything and jumped on plane. I met Masa an hour or two after after I landed.\" Like Aron, Heck wasn't totally familiar with Son's style of doing business. He made a mistake of wearing a suit jacket, even though Rubin warned him to wear jeans. \"Masa comes in completely casual, wearing slippers with a cup of tea,\" Heck said. The two proceeded to have an hour-long discussion in large conference room. Son pushed Heck on the microeconomics of his business and how quickly it could scale, drawing upon successes and failures of previous business ventures from Son's history. \"We got up and white-boarded together,\" said Heck. \"He grilled me for an hour. He wants to go as fast as you can and be number one.\" Heck said Son wanted to invest more, but he bargained Son down to \"a little less than\" $100 million as part of a $159 million Series B financing round with Greylock Partners. Unique hybrid investing model Son's focus on how companies in his portfolio can share technology makes him different from nearly every other venture capitalist, said Dave Grannan, co-founder and CEO of software-defined camera company Light, who took $100 million from the Vision Fund as part of a Series D round announced in July. Venture firms typically place a lot of bets and hope a few strike gold. Son's strategy with the Vision Fund appears to be a hybrid approach between venture capital and a diversified corporation \u2014 similar to SoftBank itself. \"You've got traditional investment funds that think one or two of their companies will make it and the rest will wither and die,\" said Heck. \"The Vision Fund is trying to make every company work well. Masa has created a new kind of entity. They can quickly deploy capital to accelerate individual bets but they're also creating a portfolio of synergy.\" For Grannan, that means eventually getting his high-resolution cameras in autonomous cars that could operate through Uber, Ola, Grab and Didi Chuxing, all of which are partially owned by the Vision Fund. It also means getting in smartphones that connect with Sprint and SoftBank's mobile network in Japan. For Aron, Son encouraged \"cross pollination\" between Cohesity and Brain Corp., co-founded by CEO Eugene Izhikevich, which enables existing machinery for autonomous use. Izhikevich says Son hasn't limited his evangelism to other Fund companies. Nearly every time Son has a conversation with anyone and the discussion turns to robotics, Son will bring up Brain Corp., Izhikevich said. \"He is our best business development person,\" Izhikevich said. \"The first time I heard he brought up Brain Corp. to someone I was just flattered he remembered us. Then I kept hearing it from different people. He remembers everything. Honestly I'm afraid to talk any numbers with him because six months later he's quoting them back to people as if we just spoke hours ago. He remembers how much we charge our customers. It\u2019s extraordinary. I wonder, is he like this with every company?\" Source: Brain Corp. Brain Corp CEO Dr. Eugene Izhikevich and Masayoshi Son Pushing to get bigger Every founder interviewed for this story said the most unique characteristic of Son's personality was his long-term vision. He tells founders he has no interest in exiting his position in their companies and has a decades-long time horizon. This may not be surprising for someone who is famous for his 300-year plan. \"SoftBank thinks longer term and bigger,\" Brandless Co-founder and CEO Tina Sharkey wrote in a Medium post this week after accepting Vision Fund money as part of a $240 million funding round for her online retailing company. \"They are investing in founders that are building new industries, not just fixing broken systems. When Ido [Leffler] and I shared our vision for Brandless, our progress, and our dreams, they smiled and began to sketch the possibilities with us.\" But there's a tension with this long-term view. Son also pushes his founders to expand as quickly as possible, as though they have no time to lose. This is driven by a specific strategy -- to make kings of his investments, said Michael Marks, who founded construction start-up Katerra and participated in a pitch at Son's mansion in Woodside. It's common for Son to ask for a larger stake in a startup than founders want to give up. The Vision Fund attempts to own about 15 percent of most companies, although some investments have gotten as high as 30 percent, according to people familiar with the matter. In Katerra's case, Son wanted a 15 percent stake in the company. While Marks didn't want to give up that big of a stake, he eventually relented, and the Vision Fund led an $865 million round of financing earlier this year. But what's happened since has surprised Marks. Taking the money has made customers more secure in doing business with Katerra, Marks said. A major hotel chain that had agreed to allow Katerra to build \"a couple of hotels\" got much more comfortable with the company after it announced the large funding round, and has since changed its order to 40 hotels, Marks said. \"It\u2019s a part of their strategy,\" Marks said. \"We\u2019ll come in with enough money that the customers, suppliers and competitors will know that this is the best company -- that this is the company that will win the industry.\" Son's bets are \"an all-out play on scale,\" agreed Heck. Nauto hasn't changed its priorities since taking Son's money but has accelerated geographic expansion and pushed products ahead of schedule. \"Instead of doing things sequentially, we're now doing them in parallel,\" Heck said. In Light's case, Son's meetings with Grannan actually altered the direction of the company. Light designs high-resolution cameras, but Son was more interested in the company's expertise in computational imaging to help build autonomous vehicles \u2014 a natural fit given Son's many investments in that area. \"We were not working on it at the time,\" Grannan said. But after taking the Vision Fund's investment, Light has begun designing products for self-driving vehicles. \"The nice thing about working with someone like Masa is he has a broad perspective. We're fairly narrowly focused in the field we\u2019re working on. He saw a path to accelerate what we were already doing. It was Masa iterating with us and putting out his vision.\" A one-man keiretsu The Vision Fund has spooked many other VC firms, who are concerned $100 billion will spike valuations for tech companies and lead to another dot-com bubble. It's pushed funds to raise more money to compete for start-ups alongside SoftBank. \"The challenge is there's too much money at all stages,\" said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of the venture firm Uncork Capital. \"We don't have enough IPOs and exits in comparison to the dollars being invested. The whole increase of holding time and delaying of exits is really a bummer, because we need even more IPOs to return cash to limited partners.\" On the plus side for the venture community, it's also become another exit option for VCs looking to liquidate, such as Benchmark's Uber sale to the Vision Fund earlier this year. No other VC firm is pushing the narrative of frictionless partnership between portfolio companies (and with SoftBank itself) like Son, said Izhikevich. Theoretically, it's a win-win for Son and his investments -- portfolio companies can pick up customers and partners, and Son can reap the benefits as all of his companies flourish. He can also weed out investments based not only on performance but also on fit with the other companies in the broader portfolio. This view of cooperation within business is derivative from the Japanese concept of keiretsu, where corporations own stakes in each other's companies to help with long-term planning. There are signs Son is building a keiretsu on his own. He has already pushed several of his investments together, such as Uber taking a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Keiretsu can have an ugly side. It can lead to price-fixing and the stifling of competition. It can also limit a company's growth. Competitors to companies in the Vision Fund family could view Son's investments as working in tandem. Japanese auto suppliers, who counted Toyota as partial owners, ran into this problem when Toyota rivals wouldn't buy from them. It's possible taking money from the Vision Fund could isolate certain companies from future customers if they're seen as favoring rivals within the Son sphere. Son originally thought the Vision Fund would be pursuing full takeovers but changed its strategy on the fly to avoid potential regulatory pitfalls, as U.S. agencies are far more likely to strike down acquisitions than minority investments. (Son did meet with President Trump in late 2016 and again in June in what some view as a tactic to befriend the administration. He will get his first regulatory question answered when Sprint's merger with T-Mobile is approved or denied). Keiretsu can also link the fates of many companies together, leading to big swings in valuation. That's a major concern for a late stage investor like the Vision Fund that's investing at a scale that's never been seen before, said Lise Buyer, founder of Class V Group, a consulting firm that helps companies that are headed for the public markets. \"Underfunding is a problem, but overfunding is a problem too,\" said Buyer. \"Companies that have too much money too soon often develop sloppy habits that come back to bite them years later when the money faucet runs dry. Valuations are going up more rapidly that what we've seen in the past. That makes a lot of these investments more speculative.\" And while Son's Vision Fund strategy appears novel, this isn't the first time technology-focused VC firms have evoked kereitsu. Kleiner Perkins talked of it on its website back in 2000 -- right around the time the last technology bubble burst. If a second storm does come, Son will be in the unique position of losing nearly all of his wealth twice. But if it doesn't come, Son could become more than a kingmaker -- he may become Silicon Valley's king. \u2014CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Payment company Square reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, thanks in part to higher transaction volumes, but the company came up short on forward guidance. Here's how the company did compared with Thomson Reuters consensus estimates: EPS: 13 cents per share vs. 11 cents expected.Adjusted revenue: $385 million vs. $367.6 million expected. Square's stock fell more than 1.3 percent in after-hours trading. Adjusted revenue grew 60 percent year over year, compared to Wall Street analysts' expectations of 52.9 percent. Transaction-based revenue surged 30 percent to $625.2 million in the second quarter. Gross payment volume, the amount of payments processed by sellers, topped $21.4 billion and rose 30 percent in the quarter. Square missed expectations for adjusted EPS guidance \u2014 it predicted between 8 and 10 cents for the third quarter, below analysts' expectations of 13 cents. Square issued adjusted revenue guidance between $407 million and $412 million, which was above the $350.1 million to $408.2 million range Wall Street was expecting. Square's Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said the miss on third-quarter EPS guidance was a result of \"putting dollars back into the business.\" \"If we build remarkable products, it will drive momentum on the top line,\" Friar said on a call with reporters. Dan Dolev, executive director and analyst at Nomura Instinet, said the guidance miss was more than offset by the massive revenue beat, and strength in Square's Cash App. \"Investors will give the company a pass because there's no weakness, they're just reinvesting,\" Dolev said. \"As long as you continue to get that revenue growth, the stock will continue to work.\" Shares of the fintech start-up, which is run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have surged more than 140 percent in the past year and 88 percent this year alone. The San Francisco-based company is best known as a credit card processor but also offers payment hardware. Its peer-to-peer Cash App is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo, according to a recent Nomura report. The company has also increased its presence in small-business lending, most recently with an eBay partnership announced in July. Square's Cash App had a breakout quarter. Customers spent a total $250 million with Cash Card, nearly triple the amount they did in December, representing $3 billion on an annualized basis. Square launched bitcoin trading through its Cash App in January. While it generated $37 million in revenue from bitcoin, it spent $36.6 million to offer the volatile cryptocurrency on its app. As a result, the company made a total $420,000 on bitcoin. For now, Square is not \"trying to push on the monetization of bitcoin today,\" Friar, the company's CFO, said. On the call with analysts, Square CEO Jack Dorsey highlighted strength in the company's food-delivery app Caviar, which doubled its revenue year over year. Revenues from subscriptions and services were also a bright spot, increasing 127 percent year over year to $137 million in the second quarter.

at the White House in Washington, D.C. Wall Street is buzzing over Apple's strong earnings results, driving its shares to a new all-time high. But in addition to the smartphone maker's premium pricing for its latest iPhone, Apple shareholders should credit President Donald Trump's tax reform for their gains this year. Apple shares rose 5.9 percent Wednesday, a day after the company posted better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of $2.34, beating the $2.18 Thomson Reuters consensus. The company's stock is now up about 19 percent so far this year versus the S&P 500's 5 percent return. The gains come even as Apple has slightly missed Wall Street's iPhone unit sales estimates in each quarter this year, reporting unit sales growth of 1 percent year over year in its June quarter and 3 percent year over year in its March quarter. This may be confusing to some market veterans because in the past Apple's stock traded primarily on whether its iPhone unit sales beat or missed Wall Street expectations. Estimates that were already lowered from a year ago, when analysts predicted the iPhone X would drive a \"super cycle\" of double-digit unit growth. Apple was able to offset slower unit growth by charging higher prices with the iPhone X, which starts at $999. The average selling price of the iPhone rose about 20 percent year over year to $724 in the June quarter, though some investors don't believe the company will able to sustain such pricing in the future. But the other difference maker for Apple this year was Trump's tax reform. The president signed the Republican tax overhaul in December, which lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. The bill also taxed overseas profits at a lower 15.5 percent repatriation tax rate, allowing companies to use foreign cash balances to invest in domestic projects or increase shareholder capital returns. As a result, Apple was able to unleash its balance sheet of more than $200 billion in cash overseas and report higher earnings growth. For example, the company's June quarter earnings per share rose by 40 percent year over year, while operating profits grew 17 percent. The difference in growth rates is due to a lower tax rate and increased shareholder capital returns (buybacks) versus the prior year. Apple's June quarter tax rate dropped to 13.3 percent from 22.9 percent last year. And the company returned about $25 billion per quarter to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends this year versus the approximately $11 billion per quarter last year. Buybacks lower Apple's shares outstanding, resulting in a higher earnings per share. More buybacks coming The company also hinted even more is coming, which is helping its share price. Apple had a $129 billion net cash position or cash minus debt at the end of the June quarter. Its management reiterated its previous guidance to bring down its large net cash position to near zero, signalling to investors that more buybacks and dividends are likely. \"As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time,\" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the earnings call Tuesday. A Wall Street analyst told clients Apple's increased stock buybacks are a key component of its earnings growth story. \"While investors looking for a 'super cycle' will remain disappointed, Apple's narrative is shifting towards their ability to sustain mid-single digit sales growth despite flat iPhone units and low-to-mid teens EPS growth via. buybacks,\" RBC Capital Markets Amit Daryanani said in a report Tuesday. One well-known investor may have reacted to Trump's tax cuts to add to his company's stake in Apple shares. In January, Warren Buffett explained to CNBC the dramatic benefit of Trump's tax reform for stocks prices. \"The tax act is a huge factor in valuation,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Jan. 10. \"You had this major change in the silent stockholder in American business who has been content with 35 percent ... and now instead of getting 35 percent interest in the earnings they get a 21 percent and that makes the remaining stock more valuable.\" Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently Apple's second-largest shareholder and added nearly 75 million shares to its stake in the smartphone maker during the first quarter.

Morgan Chase, said Monday that one of the biggest risks to the U.S. economy is the reversal of the extraordinary measures central banks took to avert disaster after the financial crisis. Starting about a decade ago, the Federal Reserve and other central banks began to purchase trillions of dollars of government bonds and other securities to inject money into the financial system, a move called \"quantitative easing\" that was coupled with slashed interest rates. In the U.S. alone, the Fed's balance sheet ballooned to $4.5 trillion from $800 billion as a result of QE. Now, after more than $12 trillion was pumped into the global system, the U.S. central bank signaled in September that it would begin to unwind the trade. The Fed has already begun by letting $40 billion of its bonds mature each month without replacing them, and other central banks have signaled they will also follow, a process dubbed \"quantitative tightening.\" Getty Images Jamie Dimon Dimon said Monday that the unwinding of the unprecedented program could backfire on the economy or spark a market panic. Potentially adding to the problem are new limitations on banks' capital and trading activities, meaning swings in asset prices could be sharper than in the past, Dimon said in an April letter to investors. A related danger would be if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than expected because of higher inflation, he said. Here are other views on the potential impact of quantitative tightening: Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary: \"The assumption manifest in the statements of the Fed and most commentary is that policy should be tightened over time through rising interest rates and a reversal of quantitative easing. Perhaps, but tightening involves real dangers and needs to be carried out with great care. \"The Fed has committed itself to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target and inflation has been below 2 percent for eight years. If a booming economy in the ninth year of recovery with this prelude is not the time for inflation above 2 per cent, when would such a time arise?\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, a $3.5 billion wealth management firm: \"I believe the market \u2013 with the S&P at an all-time high - is headed for a brick wall the deeper quantitative tightening gets. I'll say this, if the Fed pulls off QT along with more rate hikes in coming years, a soft landing is achieved and the stock market just keeps on keeping on, I will scream from some mountain top (not too high because I'm afraid of heights) that I was dead wrong.\" Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates: \"The powers of central banks to reverse contractions are more limited than they have ever been (because interest rates are so low and quantitative easing is less effective). For these reasons, I worry about what the next economic downturn will be like, though it is unlikely to come soon.\" Bank of America Merill Lynch: \"Quantitative easing was mostly characterized as an environment with too much money chasing too few bonds, lower interest rates, tighter credit spreads and volatility was suppressed. There is no doubt that quantitative tightening at times will lead to the opposite -- i.e. higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and very volatile market conditions.\" Fitch Ratings: \"The impact of such a large turnaround in central bank purchases on global financial markets is likely to be significant, despite it being widely anticipated and despite the smooth progress seen with the Fed's balance sheet reduction since last October. Private sector investors will be called upon to absorb a much greater net supply of government debt in the coming years as central banks reduce holdings and government financing needs persist in Europe and Japan and rise sharply in the US.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/02/27/104306761-_Y2A4408.jpg?v=1533556983", "time": "2018-08-01T16:51:13-0400", "author": "David A.

When National Amusements' controlling shareholder Shari Redstone pushed CBS and Viacom to merge earlier this year, her plan was simple: CBS CEO Les Moonves would run the company and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish would be his second-in-command. Now there are two paths where Bakish could get the chance to run a combined company himself. CBS balked at the deal earlier this year precisely because Bakish was floated as Moonves' No. 2. CNBC reported in April that Moonves wanted Joe Ianniello, his current COO at CBS, to be his right-hand man at a combined company. Redstone wanted Bakish, who has helped get Viacom in better financial shape since he was named full-time CEO in December 2016. CBS announced Monday afternoon that the board would hire \"outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation\" on accusations that Moonves had sexually harassed female employees over the years. It made no decision on Moonves' fate and pushed back the company's annual shareholder meeting to a future undetermined time. Given the allegations in Ronan Farrow's New Yorker article and the tensions between Moonves and Shari Redstone, playing out in a still-pending legal battle over control of CBS, Moonves's future as CBS's CEO is questionable at best. So, how do we get from where we are today to a combined CBS-Viacom, possibly run by Bakish? There are two likely paths. Path 1: Redstone removes board members The CBS annual meeting was originally scheduled for May, then was set for August 10. It's not clear who on the board pressed for the postponement. But there's another series of important dates on the calendar -- in early October. That's when a trial is set to determine whether CBS can move forward with the dividend that would dilute National's voting control over the company from 80 percent to 17 percent. As it currently stands, Redstone has the power to remove CBS's board. But the trial could strip that ability. If the company's annual meeting is held before October, she could also vote to remove directors seen to be complicit with Moonves, said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. The sexual harrassment charges could give her air-cover to clean house on a board that appears to have turned against her and sided with Moonves. If this happens, a new board could then restart merger talks with Viacom. CNBC reported CBS and Viacom had agreed on a price during the company's merger talks earlier this year. That suggests the sides could be open to hammering out a quick deal if Moonves were removed. Path 2: Moonves resigns or is fired If Moonves resigns or the board decides to fire him after investigating, the existing directors could decide that putting the companies together was now in the best interest of CBS shareholders. CBS hasn't outlined a succession plan for Moonves, even though Moonves insisted during merger discussions that Ianniello should stay as his second in command. Still, Ianniello can resign \"with good reason\" if he isn't the next CEO of CBS, according to his contract, suggesting he has been groomed to take over for Moonves. But if Moonves leaves, the CBS board (prompted by Redstone) may decide the best way to reset the culture at the company and to derive future value is to push the company together with Viacom and install Bakish as CEO. This would be an extreme about-face from May. However, if Moonves himself was the primary obstacle to a deal, the board could argue his absence has changed the value proposition enough that a merger is now in the best interest of CBS shareholders. CBS and Viacom would then, again, hire special committees to review a deal, and CBS would need to add new independent directors, said Greenfield. This path may also increase the chances that at least some members of the CBS board keep their jobs. The future of a combined CBS-Viacom Bakish may not be the best long-term CEO for the company, said Greenfield, who suggests a combined company may want to look for external hires. But he is the logical choice \"given a lack of anyone else,\" he said. While both CBS and Viacom could stay independent, Greenfield believes putting the companies together is still the best idea for both companies. There are few, if any, buyers for Viacom, and \"I literally can't think of any buyers\" for CBS, Greenfield said. Media companies are huddling together in the belief that size will help them stave off competition from digital giants like Netflix and Amazon. Recent mergers, like Fox's $71.3 billion sale to Disney and AT&T's $85 billion megadeal for Time Warner (pending appeal) have increased the pressure. At this point, the only significant dance partners CBS and Viacom have may be each other. After coming together, CBS and Viacom could begin to roll up other media companies, such as Lions Gate and MGM, to build up heft, Greenfield said. \"Both companies need greater scale,\" said Greenfield. \"CBS and Viacom should merge.\" show chapters CBS takes no action against CEO Les Moonves for now 9:54 AM ET Tue, 31 July 2018 | 01:25 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/19/105340807-1532018385992suni2.jpg?v=1532018460", "time": "2018-08-01T16:57:45-0400", "author": "David A.

It seemed like a wild gamble a year ago. As rumors heated up that Apple was preparing to launch a new iPhone in the $1,000 range, the pile on from the tech pundit community came in swiftly. The reported features of a then-unnamed iPhone wouldn't be enough to justify the $1,000 price and spur a new \"super cycle\" of sales growth last seen in 2014 and 2015 after the launch of the iPhone 6. It turns out the critics were only half right. While iPhone sales growth is slowing \u2014 sales were essentially flat year over year for the June quarter and Apple slightly missed sales estimates \u2014 the pricey iPhone X has helped maximize profitability out of the company's most important product. Apple said the average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone last quarter was $724, smashing expectations. And that ASP, juiced by the thousand-dollar iPhone X, boosted Apple's profits to a whopping $2.34 per share, up 40 percent year over year and beating Wall Street's expectations of $2.18 per share. In short, Apple's iPhone sales may not be growing at the dizzying pace they were a few years ago. But Apple has figured out a $1,000 iPhone is the best way to squeeze even more profits out of a flattening user base. The trend doesn't just affect Apple, by the way. The entire smartphone market has started to shrink, according to research firm Gartner. But Apple is one of the few companies that can keep smartphone profits exploding in that tough market. Earlier this week, Samsungreportedlackluster Galaxy S9 sales, which hurt its profit growth. Apple may be able to do it again next year. According to the reliable tech analyst Ming Chi Kuo of TF International Securities and other media reports, Apple will launch a larger version of the iPhone X this year. If the \"regular\" iPhone X starts at $999, then you can expect that plus-sized version to go for at least $1,099, assuming Apple keeps a similar pricing structure for each tier of iPhone model. That puts Apple in a good position to keep the iPhone ASP growing throughout 2019. The iPhone is Apple's magical money-making machine. And while side businesses like digital services and accessories are showing rapid, healthy growth, Apple has figured out a new formula to keep profits exploding simply by introducing pricier versions of its most important product. There are a few troubling trends that could dampen iPhone profits. The company started offering cheaper battery replacements at $29, which can keep iPhones from slowing down and extend their life by an extra year or two. That could mean some users will be able to resist plopping down $1,000 for a new iPhone until they absolutely need to. Still, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that Apple isn't paying attention to the number of battery replacements, and it isn't concerned about how it could affect upgrade numbers. The key to Apple's big June quarter wasn't that it out-innovated its competition or dreamed up a brand new business. It's really as simple as this -- it convinced millions of people to pay a lot more for their new iPhone. show chapters Apple's Tim Cook: We view tariffs as tax on consumers 8:50 AM ET Wed, 1 Aug 2018 | 01:40 \u200b "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/17/105335334-1531847398539gettyimages-1000632232.jpeg?v=1531847461", "time": "2018-08-01T15:14:11-0400", "author": "Alex Wong | Getty Images", "description": "Markets expected the Federal Reserve's policymaking body to maintain the target range for its benchmark interest rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/01/fomc-august-rate-decision.html", "title": "Fed leaves rates unchanged but upgrades view of the US economy to 'strong'", "keywords": [{"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2:40 PM ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "1", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "The Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Federal Open Market Committee", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.75 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "September", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4.1 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the second quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "nearly four years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "between now and September", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "third", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "James McCann", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Aberdeen Standard Investments", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jerome Powell", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "September", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Jerome Powell", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the end of the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "91.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "September", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "68.2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "December", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CME", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "March", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "December 2015", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "zero", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "seven years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Krishna Guha", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Evercore ISI", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Minutes", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "three weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the same day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Atlanta Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "third-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4.7 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "5 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the full year before", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2.4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the following year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1.8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump administration", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "at least 3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2:40 PM ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "1", "category": "CARDINAL"}], "body": " show chapters Fed leaves interest rates unchanged 2:40 PM ET Wed, 1 Aug 2018 | 03:14 The Federal Reserve upgraded its assessment of the U.S. economy Wednesday but decided to skip another interest rate increase for now. In a widely expected move, the central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to keep the target range for its benchmark rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent. However, the committee is widely expected to approve an increase at the September meeting and a tweak in the language from the post-meeting statement could be a nod toward more monetary policy normalization. The statement said the labor market has \"continued to strengthen,\" language consistent with the June meeting. However, the committee went on to note that \"economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,\" a more bullish view than the June characterization of \"solid\" growth. In addition, the statement noted that household spending and business fixed investment have \"grown strongly.\" That, too, is an improvement from June's characterization that household spending has \"picked up.\" The tweaks come days after the government said GDP grew at a 4.1 percent rate in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years. In addition, the unemployment rate is near a generational low at 4 percent, though manufacturing data released Wednesday pointed to concerns about the impact that tariffs would have on activity. The Fed statement made no mention of the tariff battle in which the U.S. is engaged with its global trading partners. \"It is going to be interesting to watch the Fed's communications between now and September, when we expect the central bank to deliver a third hike of 2018,\" James McCann, Aberdeen Standard Investments senior global economist, said in a note. Chairman Jerome Powell \"has already attracted the ire of the President for raising rates. This political interference is clearly unhelpful but may return as September approaches.\" Policy remains 'accommodative' There were no other substantial changes in the statement. The committee noted that its policy stance remains \"accommodative\" and said inflation continues to progress near the Fed's 2 percent goal. But multiple Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have sent indications that two more interest rate hikes are coming before the end of the year. Traders in the fed funds futures market are indicating a 91.4 percent chance of a September increase and a 68.2 percent probability for another move in December, according to the CME's tracker. They would come on top of previous hikes in March and June. However, the Fed of late has run into some significant political resistance. President Donald Trump, in a recent CNBC interview, bemoaned the central bank's desire to keep up with its gradual but consistent move to resume normalizing policy. The Fed has been on a rate-hiking cycle since December 2015, after keeping the funds rate near zero for seven years. Trump said he is worried that rate hikes could stymie growth that only recently has broken out of its post-recession slumber. There was no indication in the statement of discussions regarding the president's historically unusual remarks, and most observers believe the Fed won't be swayed by presidential rhetoric. Fed officials \"essentially ignored the recent pressure from President Trump to slow down or pause the rate hikes that have been supporting dollar strength,\" Krishna Guha, head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said in a note.\" Minutes released in three weeks will give more insight into how FOMC members view the economy. The meeting decision came the same day that the Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP forecast from 4.7 percent to 5 percent. Though the reading is preliminary and almost certain to change, such growth would only fuel the Fed's desire to keep moving rates higher. Committee members in June estimated that GDP would rise 2.8 percent for the full year before moderating to 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2 percent the following year and then settle into a longer-run pattern of 1.8 percent. Trump administration officials reject that sentiment, believing that their economic program of lower taxes and regulation coupled with higher spending can sustain growth of at least 3 percent.

The stock opened at 2.75 Canadian dollars on the Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker GLXY. Shares had fallen 20 percent in the first half hour of trading, and were trading at CA $1.98 as of 1:48 p.m. ET. Former Goldman Sachs macro trader Michael Novogratz launched the company in November, a month before bitcoin hit its all-time high near $20,000. The firm took a $134 million hit in the first quarter, according to its first-ever financial disclosure released in Canada last week. The Manhattan-based firm reported a net loss of $103.3 million on trading, with $13.5 million on digital assets and $85.5 million of unrealized losses on those assets. Canadian regulators kept the company from listing for eight months, and in the meantime bitcoin lost roughly half its value. Since the company sold shares in a private placement in January, the price of bitcoin has fallen by roughly 50 percent, according to data from CoinDesk. In the disclosure last week, Novogratz outlined an unusual method for listing his merchant bank on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange: buying Canadian crypto start-up Coin Capital, then merging through a reverse takeover with Canadian shell company Bradmer Pharmaceuticals. The renamed company will trade as Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd and will have more than 70 employees, according to the release. Despite bitcoin's price plunge, Novogratz said in a BNN Bloomberg Television interview this week that going public was still the right move. \"If I knew what I know now, knew the crypto markets were going to swoon as much, and it was going to take so long, I might have stayed private for another year or so and then gone public,\" Novogratz said. \"But I don't think it's a mistake.\" The former Fortress hedge fund manager said he eventually plans for Galaxy to be \"globally traded\" in Hong Kong, Frankfurt and London. Novogratz told CNBC in November that bitcoin could \"easily\" hit $40,000 by the end of 2018. He guessed ethereum, which was trading near $434 this week, could hit roughly $1,500. Bitcoin has gone the opposite direction since that call, down more than 60 percent since its high in December. Still, the cryptocurrency is up 180 percent from a year ago when it was trading around $2,800, according to data from CoinDesk. if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-GcbFZ\"),window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"GcbFZ\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"GcbFZ\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/31/105365414-1533059009324gettyimages-527564346.jpeg?v=1533059168", "time": "2018-07-31T19:07:54-0400", "author": "STR | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "U.S.-listed shares of Baidu hit an all-time intraday high of $284.22 on May 16.

Analysts say they are growing more confident in Apple's services business, which includes its App Store, music subscription and cloud services offerings. The smartphone maker on Tuesday posted better than expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of $2.34, beating the $2.18 Thomson Reuters consensus. Apple also gave sales guidance above Wall Street expectations for its September quarter. Its shares was up 5.9 percent Wednesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Apple, citing the company's growth in its services segment. Its sales grew 31 percent year over year in the June quarter versus the 26 percent Wall Street consensus. \"This was the best quarter ever for Services with Apple reporting strength from App Store, Apple Music, Apple Care and Apple Pay,\" analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note to clients Tuesday. \"Management remains confident in doubling its F2016 Services revenue by F2020.\" Mohan reaffirmed his $230 price target for Apple shares, representing 21 percent upside to Tuesday's close. Morgan Stanley said Apple's services growth may make up for any future slowdown in iPhone sales. \"We see more upside than downside risk to the upcoming iPhone product cycle and a building Services narrative. Even if device revenue growth slows, Services and Wearables can pick up the slack,\" analyst Katy Huberty said in a note to clients Wednesday. Huberty reiterated her overweight rating and $232 price target for Apple shares. One Wall Street analyst specifically called out Apple's paid subscription offerings, which contributed to its better than expected services sales growth. Apple's \"services revenue growth rate \u2026 [drove] upside in Jun qtr,\" Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"It was a beat and was largely driven by paid subscription (which is a significant and growing part of services revenue) growth, including Apple Music, iCloud, etc.\" Olson reaffirmed his overweight rating and raised his price target to $218 from $214 for Apple shares.

Investors also digested the Federal Reserve's latest decision on monetary policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 81.37 points to 25,333.82 with big exporters Caterpillar and 3M lagging. The S&P 500 closed 0.1 percent lower at 2,813.36 as industrials dropped more than 1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite bucked the lower trend, however, closing 0.4 percent higher at 7,707.29 on the back of strong gains from Apple. Reuters reported, citing a source, the Trump administration is looking at the possibility of slapping a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods \u2014 after initially setting them at 10 percent. \"On trade, it seems like it's a day-by-day story,\" said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"Last week, it was about the de-escalation of trade tensions with Europe.\" \"In the short term, the impact of fiscal stimulus and strong economic data will outweigh the impact of tariffs,\" Baele said. But if the trade situation escalates, trace could have a more permanent impact on stocks, he said. Drew Angerer | Getty Images News | Getty Images The Federal Reserve concluded a two-day meeting on monetary policy on Wednesday in which it left interest rates unchanged. The decision was widely expected, but the central bank upgraded its view on the economy, calling it \"strong.\" \"It was basically a nonevent,\" said Eric Stein, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance. \"The market was priced in for this decision. I think the Fed is still on track to raise rates in September.\" Treasury yields rose ahead of the announcement, with the 10-year note yield breaking above 3 percent for the first time since June. At around 4 p.m. ET, the benchmark yield traded at 2.999 percent. \"It seems like this Fed is trying not to repeat the mistakes of the past,\" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"Usually, toward the end of the cycle, the Fed tends to accelerate rate hikes. This Fed shows no inclination of doing that.\" The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 percent as Apple climbed to a record high on strong quarterly results. Apple jumped more than 5 percent. Apple reported earnings and revenue for the previous quarter that topped analyst expectations. Apple's gains gave the broader tech sector a much-needed boost after disappointing quarterly numbers from Facebook and Twitter sent it down sharply. Since July 26, tech has dropped 5.1 percent through Tuesday's close. The sector rose 1 percent on Wednesday. ADP and Moody's Analytics said the private payrolls in the U.S. grew by 219,000 in July, more than the 185,000 gain forecast by Reuters. July's job gains were the best since February, when 241,000 jobs were added. The report from ADP and Moody's comes ahead of the U.S. government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is scheduled for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. \"The ADP survey has never been a great guide to the actual payrolls figures, but there is plenty of other evidence suggesting that jobs growth has remained strong,\" said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. \"Most employment surveys are at a high level, while initial jobless claims recently touched their lowest level in almost 50 years. With activity booming on the back of the fiscal stimulus, the continued strength of the labor market will keep the pressure on the Fed to continue raising interest rates,\" Hunter said. \u2014CNBC's Alexandra Gibbs contributed to this report.

If you look at the amount of cash they have, and you take that out of the mix, they're actually not trading at that high a multiple of earnings,\" the professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business told CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Wednesday. \"So I think, unlike the other tech stocks, which are trading richly relative to future earnings, Apple is still a reasonably priced stock.\" Apple shares rallied 5 percent Wednesday, a day after reporting strong fiscal third-quarter earnings. Apple hit the $200 per share mark during mid-morning trading and remains within a few percentage points of a $1 trillion market capitalization, a feat no other U.S. public company has ever achieved. \"This is a cash machine, but it's not going to be a high-growth company: those days are behind it,\" said Damodaran who is widely regarded as one of the foremost experts in valuing companies and is often referred to as Wall Street's \"dean of valuation.\" \"It is the greatest cash machine in history and I'll say that again because it's a company \u2014 it can't stop throwing off cash. I mean companies wish they had Apple's problem,\" he added. Apple said Tuesday it had $243.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. That cash hoard alone is bigger than the market value of 484 companies in the S&P 500, including Intel and AT&T. The company trades at 14.9 times analysts' earnings estimates for the fiscal year 2019, compared with a forward P/E ratio of 15.9 for the S&P 500. \"I think as long as you're realistic that you're buying a low-growth company that's going to throw off cash like crazy for the next few years, then I think you're getting a reasonably good investment,\" Damodaran said. At the latest reading, shares of Apple were up 33 percent over the past year and up 18.4 percent during the last three months.

Thomas Moore, the \u200einvestment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told \"Squawk Box Europe\" Thursday that the premium being paid for companies with decent growth potential is higher that it has been at any time since the dotcom bubble peaked in 2000. \"Investors have lost sight of valuations in the last few months,\" said Moore before adding that \"conditions are there for a rotation in the second half of the year.\" A growth stock is one that tends to increase in capital value rather than yield high income. FANG stocks would be a typical example. On the other hand a stock is considered \"value\" if it trades at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends and earnings. Moore said an economic acceleration in the United States coupled with solid earnings figures would encourage investors to trust stocks and sectors that have previously been written off. \"People who are in their twenties will be thinking that old economy stocks are losers. But there will come a time for them. Amazon won't be disrupting every sector. They won't be building roads, they won't be constructing homes,\" said Moore. The analyst said some investors are admitting their stocks are overvalued but maintain holdings by arguing that they can't find any attractive investments elsewhere. He added that value and growth equities have alternated market leadership for decades and the latter has been in control since 2008. In a note to CNBC the investor said it was only time \"before this crowded long (position) unwinds.\" Holding a focus on U.K.-listed equities, Moore identified BP and Royal Dutch Shell as a good example of traditional stocks that have redoubled efforts to cut costs, thereby increasing cash flow and opportunities for dividend payouts. He also said the unloved U.K. financial sector should be trawled for value. The analyst admitted that Brexit was the big issue that could drag on cyclical firms. \"In the U.K. inflation is lagging wages, employment is going up and hiring intentions are going up but because of Brexit people are saying 'no deal I'm not buying these stocks',\" he said. Moore argued that once there was a resolution on the U.K.'s exit from Europe there could be \"a wall of money\" ready to invest in British-listed firms. Thomas Moore owns both BP and Royal Dutch Shell in the funds he manages for Aberdeen Standard Investments. He also has a personal holding in BP.

" Till Muellenmeister | AFP | Getty Images A man waves an US flag in Kibera neighbourhood, Nairobi on July 25, 2015.PHOTO/Till Muellenmeister (Photo credit should read Till Muellenmeister/AFP/Getty Images) The African continent offers real opportunities thanks to some of the world's fastest growing economies and an expanding labor force. As a Cabinet Secretary and a Democratic Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, respectively, we agree that the United States must do more to present our African partners with better alternatives to state-led economic models, promoted by countries like China, so Africa can assume its rightful place in the global economy. Through efforts such as its Belt and Road Initiative, China is pursuing a neo-mercantilist vision that uses investment in infrastructure to secure an economic foothold, from which it is attempting to secure political, diplomatic, and in some cases military access, with potentially serious consequences for U.S. interests from Central Asia to Eastern Europe and Africa. China is, at the same time, bankrolling new financial organizations that aim to rival or displace the international institutions created by the United States and its allies after the Second World War. By pouring money into Africa, China has seen an opportunity to both gain political influence and to reap future rewards in a continent whose economies are predicted to boom in the coming decades. Just spend a few hours in a major African city \u2013 from Abidjan, to Addis Ababa, to Nairobi \u2013 and you will see the hallmarks of China's economic presence. Over the past decade, China has either financed or contributed to financing infrastructure projects across the continent, offering billions of dollars in commercial loans at concessional rates to African governments and state-owned entities. But China's commercial path has not always applied the highest international standards of openness, inclusivity, transparency, and governance. The United States seeks sovereign African states that are integrated into the world economy, able to provide for their citizens' needs, and capable of managing threats to peace and security. We oppose opaque investment and development initiatives that impose undue costs and burdens on recipients, limiting their options for determining their own future. Fragmented and outdated As competitors like China explore opportunities to leverage state financing to pave economic inroads, U.S. government foreign investment entities remain fragmented and outdated. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the leading U.S. development finance institution, is unable to compete with its Chinese counterpart. Unlike Chinese institutions, OPIC works to fund private sector-led projects that will be economically sound over the long haul. Yet the agency lacks any consistent Congressional authorization and has no way of leveraging new financial tools that have drastically changed the face of the global economy. Passage of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018, better known as the BUILD Act, would change this unsustainable situation. This bipartisan legislation would reform and modernize government development finance by establishing the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC). Moreover, this legislation would allow the IDFC to more than double OPIC's investment portfolio and allow us to participate in equity investments, provide technical assistance, and issue catalytic grants to mobilize capital for innovative projects that advance our national security and foreign policy objectives. Most importantly, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, on net, implementing the legislation would reduce Federal costs and direct spending. The BUILD Act also contains important reforms to reduce risks to taxpayers and ensures Congress will maintain strong oversight to make certain the agency does not provide financing where the private sector could. By modernizing our development finance tools, the United States can send a clear message that we will continue to lead the world in supporting sound, responsible and fair economic growth, as well as sustainable and equitable business practices. This matters more than ever before as developing countries decide whether to follow a model based on free market capitalism, the rule of law and transparency, or an opaque, autocratic, state-led alternative that promotes corruption, debt, and dependency. The BUILD Act will make a difference Passage of the BUILD Act will make a real difference by increasing American investment in low and middle-income countries while also making a positive impact on local communities and populations. In 2017, OPIC investments supported 13,000 new jobs in host countries. With the BUILD Act, this number could grow significantly, helping to create new trading partners and therefore greater prosperity for the United States and our partners. By planting the seeds of free market growth, the IDFC will help businesses and economies grow by supporting critical development projects in sectors such as energy, agriculture, infrastructure, and healthcare around the world. The President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa, a 50-person strong delegation of American CEOs and senior leaders of the United States Government tasked with identifying and addressing barriers to expanding trade with African partners, recently concluded a two-week fact-finding mission to Ethiopia, Kenya, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Ghana. At each stop, the delegation heard from host governments and the private sector about the critical need for development finance reform to even the playing field for American companies. With the BUILD Act having just passed the House, and now proceeding in the Senate, we must send a loud and clear message: The United States intends to remain fully engaged in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world. The IDFC would expand America's influence there and help support its private sector. The BUILD Act has the support of the Trump Administration and a bipartisan coalition, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. and Senator Tim Kaine, D-Va. It unanimously passed the House of Representatives, with a bipartisan coalition led by Representatives Ted Yoho, R-Fla. and Adam Smith, D-Wash. The two of us, supporters of the bill from two political parties and two branches of government now urge the Senate to act swiftly to ensure the United States maintains its historic role spearheading global economic growth and prosperity.

On Wednesday's post-earnings conference call, Tesla took its first questions from the two analysts Musk had dismissed three months earlier, when the company reported first-quarter results. That day, the stock plunged in after-hours trading in response to what Musk called \"boring, bonehead questions\" from analysts. This time, Musk showed contrition and Tesla shares surged 8.5 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday, adding about $4.75 billion to the stock's value. The stock closed up 16 percent Thursday. \"My apologies for not being polite on the prior call,\" Musk said, blaming his behavior in part on a lack of sleep and overwork. \"I appreciate that,\" said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, in response. \"Thank you.\" And Wall Street took notice that perhaps Tesla's chief executive will not distract investors with problematic behavior going forward. KeyBanc Capital Markets called it \"maybe the most valuable apology of all time.\" show chapters This was Elon Musk's most thorough and sane conference call, says Jim Cramer 10:07 AM ET Thu, 2 Aug 2018 | 02:38 \"Elon Musk apologized multiple times for his inappropriate behavior on last quarter's call,\" analyst Brad Erickson said in the note to clients Wednesday. \"TSLA's forward commentary was mostly better than feared, \u2026 and the CEO worked to restore some faith and credibility with investors that he can be a plus to the investment narrative, not a minus.\" Erickson reiterated his sector weight rating for Tesla shares due to the company's high valuation. The electric car maker's second-quarter earnings per share loss of $3.06 was lower than analysts' expectations of a $2.92 loss, but the company backed its prior forecast for profitable third and fourth quarters. Tesla said it is now aiming to produce 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, which it hopes to achieve by the end of this month. Piper Jaffray reiterated its overweight rating for Tesla shares, saying the company's report may be a positive turning point for the company. \"This could be the start of something big. A few years from now, investors may conclude that 2Q18 was the quarter in which Tesla cemented its position as a truly formidable player in the global automotive market,\" analyst Alexander Potter said in a note to clients Wednesday. Potter raised his price target to $389 from $369 for Tesla shares, representing 29 percent upside to Wednesday's close. One analyst took solace in Tesla's statement on its conference call that the company does not plan or need to raise more capital. \"Tesla reiterated earnings and positive cash flow guidance, and the company has no plans to raise equity capital,\" Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note to clients Thursday. \"A major step function up in Q3 revenue will strongly counter the popular narrative around bankruptcy risk, thus reducing an estimated $12 billion in short interest and driving shares higher.\" Shah reaffirmed his buy rating and $450 price target for Tesla shares. Here's what all major analysts are saying about Tesla. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.

Just days before federal agents raided Michael Cohen's home and office, Donald Trump's then-personal lawyer secured a $10 million agreement with a top donor, The Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. The payment was conditional on Cohen securing funding for reactors at the Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant in Alabama, sources told the Journal. That included a $5 billion loan from the federal government, the Journal reported. Sources told the Journal that real-estate developer Franklin Haney also agreed to pay Cohen a monthly retainer. It reported that Haney's company still has a loan application pending at the Energy Department. The newspaper said, however, it was not able to determine how much Haney ultimately paid Cohen, if at all. But sources told the Journal that Cohen's agreed success fee would be among the largest of his known consulting deals. Last year, AT&T paid Cohen $600,000 for insight on how the Trump administration might approach its proposed merger with Time Warner, among other issues. Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis said it paid the lawyer $1.2 million to help the company navigate proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act. Cohen is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for his business dealings, as well as for a $130,000 hush-money payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels right before the 2016 presidential election. A lawyer for Haney told the Journal, \"Neither Mr. Haney nor Nuclear Development LLC ever entered into a contract with Michael Cohen or his affiliate for lobbying services related to the Bellefonte project.\" A representative for Cohen declined to comment to the Journal. The White House did not respond to Journal's request for comment. A lawyer for Cohen did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Square generated $37 million in revenue on bitcoin in the second quarter, but it spent almost as much to offer free trading of the volatile cryptocurrency on its Square Cash App. For now, the payments start-up says it's not relying on crypto to add to its bottom line. \"It's not a major monetization engine,\" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said on a call with reporters after releasing second-quarter earnings Wednesday. \"The goal is to continue to drive utility in the Cash App.\" The payment company launched bitcoin trading in its Cash App in January. In order for customers to be able to buy and sell bitcoin instantly, Square holds a certain amount of cryptocurrency on the customer's behalf. But in the time between Square buying bitcoin and customers making a trade, the price can change drastically and the company can lose money, Friar explained. \"We have some spread in there to allow for the fact that bitcoin is volatile,\" she said. \"We're not trying to push on the monetization of bitcoin today.\" Bitcoin has lost nearly half its value this year, and the price often rises or falls by hundreds of dollars in a single day. The cryptocurrency gained attention after climbing to almost $20,000 in December. Of Square's total $815 million net revenue, which grew 48 percent year over year, bitcoin brought in $37 million. But the company spent $36.6 million on bitcoin. In total, Square made a total $420,000 on the cryptocurrency. \"We only apply a small margin to the market cost of bitcoin when we sell bitcoin to customers, and we have no control over the cost of bitcoin in the market, which tends to be volatile,\" Square said in the 10-Q . The fintech company brought in $385 million in adjusted revenue, which factored out transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs. That number was above what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The company also outperformed on EPS but came up short on EBITDA and EPS guidance analysts had expected for the third quarter. The company, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is best known as a credit card processor but also offers payment hardware, the peer-to-peer Cash App, and small business lending. Shares of the start-up have surged more than 140 percent in the past year and 88 percent this year alone.

Apple revealed an adjusted outstanding share count of 4,829,926,000 alongside the company's June quarter results in a filing Wednesday.

Apple shares reached the historic $1 trillion market value Thursday, hitting the $207.05 price that was needed to get to the milestone. The tech giant is the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. Some investors may worry the most valuable company reaching these new heights could portend a significant drop is ahead like during dot-com technology bubble. It's possible it could cool off in the short term, but for long-term investors the stock's valuation is far from extreme and based on improving fundamentals. The company's stock rose 2.9 percent Thursday, bringing its year-to-date return to 22 percent versus the S&P 500's 6 percent gain. Apple is valued at just 15.7 times analysts' earnings estimates for its next 12 months, compared with a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.5 times for the S&P 500. The valuation disparity comes as the smartphone maker increased its sales by 17 percent year over year and its earnings by 40 percent year over year in its June quarter, versus the estimated 8 percent sale growth rate for the average S&P 500 company this year. In comparison, during the dot-com bubble the top technology stocks were valued at much higher earnings multiples. Microsoft traded at 59 times earnings, Cisco at 179 times earnings, Intel at 126 times earnings and Oracle at 87 times earnings in 2000. Wall Street's \"dean of valuation,\" Aswath Damodaran, told CNBC on Wednesday that Apple is still \"reasonably valued\" and \"not trading at that high a multiple of earnings\" at these levels. In addition to Apple's attractive valuation versus the market, investors also get the benefit of the company's increasing shareholder capital returns. Apple returned about $25 billion per quarter to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends this year versus the approximately $11 billion per quarter last year. Buybacks lower the company's shares outstanding, resulting in higher earnings per share. The tech giant hinted even more is coming, which is helping its share price. Apple had a $129 billion net cash position or cash minus debt at the end of the June quarter. On Tuesday its management reiterated its previous guidance to bring down its large net cash position to near zero, signalling to investors that more buybacks and dividends are likely. One well-known investor has endorsed Apple's stock buyback program as a big reason to own the company's shares. In May, Warren Buffett explained to CNBC the dramatic benefit of Apple's capital return programs for shareholders. \"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares,\" he said. \"We own about 5 percent. But I know I don't have to do a thing and probably in a couple of years we'll own 6 percent without laying out another dollar. Well, I love the idea of having 5 percent go to 6 percent.\" Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently Apple's second-largest shareholder and added nearly 75 million shares to its stake in the smartphone maker during the first quarter.

The electric automaker reported $4 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating Wall Street estimates of $3.92 billion. Despite the revenue beat, the company posted a larger-than-expected loss for the quarter. Tesla reported a loss of $3.06 per share versus analysts' estimates of a loss of $2.92 per share. The company also said that it expects production of its Model 3 to reach between 50,000 and 55,000 units in its third quarter. TripAdvisor shares plunged more than 12 percent in the extended session after the company reported disappointing second quarter revenues. The travel and restaurant website missed Wall Street estimates of $435 million in revenue, seeing only $433 million in sales for the quarter. Despite the revenue miss, the company's earnings did beat estimates, reporting 41 cents per share versus the 39 cents per share expected by analysts. Wynn Resorts stock dropped more than 7 percent during after-hours trading, before recovering some of those losses. The Las Vegas-based company reported second quarter results that missed analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line. Wynn reported earnings of $1.53 per share, a 43 cent difference from Wall Street estimates of $1.96 per share. It also missed revenue expectations, reporting $1.61 billion in sales during its second quarter versus the $1.71 billion estimated by analysts. FitBit shares were up as much as 6.42 percent in extended-hours trading, before giving up some of those gains.

While well below the pre-crisis payout, the ability to offer a dividend to shareholders is a milestone for the group, RBS Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said on Friday. This initial interim dividend will stand at 2 pence per share. \"It's obviously a massive event for the organization \u2014 last time we paid a dividend was 2007. I think it's a really positive sign of how much progress the bank has made over the last few years,\" he told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford. The U.K. lender has been mired in a years-long legal saga with the DOJ over its selling of toxic mortgages in the U.S. in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The lengthy settlement agreement process has prevented the bank from providing dividends to its shareholders. In May, RBS agreed to pay a \u00a33.6 billion ($4.9 billion) penalty to the DOJ to end the investigation. \"We do have to get the DOJ agreement signed relating to RBS, but once that's signed we've declared today a 2 (pence) dividend subject to that,\" the CFO said. \"And I do think from here we'll build payouts very nicely, we do expect payouts to increase significantly going into 2019 and 2020.\" RBS also reported a loss for the first half of the year after paying out \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) of the DOJ fine.

So overall pretty pleased with the results.\" Conduct and litigation costs were \u00a3801 million for the year's first half, including the \u00a31 billion DOJ settlement. Still, costs are down for the group by \u00a3133 million, down 3.6 percent compared to the same period in 2017.

Before Apple hit $1 trillion in market value Thursday, there was Chinese oil giant PetroChina, which reached the milestone more than a decade ago. It did not fare too well after that. PetroChina's market cap hit $1 trillion in 2007 following a successful debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Nov. 5 of that year. The company's Shanghai-listed shares nearly tripled at the open that day, with its Hong Kong-listed shares following them higher. (It had debuted on the Hong Kong exchange years earlier.) The rise gave the company a market cap of $1.1 trillion on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. According to Reuters, PetroChina's opening price in Shanghai valued the company at 60 times analysts' forecasts for its 2007 earnings per share, above the global average of 18 times for oil company's at the time. It was all downhill from there, however. PetroChina's market value plummeted to less than $260 billion by the end of 2008, representing the largest destruction of shareholder wealth in world history, according to Bloomberg. Blame the financial crisis and a collapse in oil prices. When PetroChina made its debut in 2007 brent crude prices were at one point, above $140 a barrel. Today they are about half that. PetroChina has not fared too well since the end of 2008, either. The company's Hong Kong-listed stock is down more than 20 percent since the start of 2009. Apple closed 2.9 percent higher at $207.39 a share on Thursday, pushing its market cap to $1 trillion and making it the first U.S. publicly traded company to reach the mark.

Canaccord Genuity's Michael Walkley defended his $220 price target on shares of Apple. \"You need earnings to continue to move higher to push the stock materially above $220 per share. The multiple has expanded and in our view the earnings really need to continue to expand,\" he said. It's \"really now about the new iPhone rollout.\" The subdued bullishness on Apple's share price is likely due to more modest iPhone sales, according to several Wall Street analysts, who told CNBC that consumer demand for more innovation has forced the Cupertino, California-based company to increase the selling price of its phones. \"The general issue is that Apple has had innovation but it's coming at a higher price, and they've had to raise the price point for the their thanks to higher component costs,\" added Raymond James's Chris Caso. \"The gains that they've seen in the iPhone thus far ... have been driven by price increases. The question outstanding is: have they gotten to the end of revenue gain they can make by increasing the price?\" The company is expected to release its latest iteration of iPhones and other products this fall, an event many said they'd be scrutinizing for any reason to adjust their estimates. \"We don't know what the next set of product launches are going to be and we don't know the prices of those products coming out this fall,\" said RBC analyst Amit Daryanani. \"Come September, when you have the iPhone pricing, you'll have better prediction. You could have multiple expansion on the stock.\" Morningstar Equity Research, which has a bearish $175 per share target on the stock over the next two to three years, sees the $1 trillion milestone as a reach for investors, predicting a slip down the road. \"These targets get set in investors' minds, so there's an element of momentum here today. Once it reaches that targets you will likely see a modest pullback,\" said Morningstar Equity Research's Abhinav Davuluri. \"A lot for the raises [in price target's across Wall Street] were a testament to the very strong results.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/08/02/105370958-1533207829499gettyimages-846680558.jpeg?v=1533207894", "time": "2018-08-02T07:05:27-0400", "author": "Vivek Prakash | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have hit business and consumer confidence \u2014 and that's a bigger challenge to overcome right now compared to any direct economic damage inflicted by tariffs, says Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/dbs-ceo-piyush-gupta-on-second-quarter-earnings-us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Bank CEO says he's worried the US-China trade war will dent market psychology", "keywords": [{"term": "US", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "1:32 AM ET Thu", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "2", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "02:47 Trade", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "China", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Southeast Asia's", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "Piyush Gupta", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "DBS Group Holdings", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Martin Soong", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Animal", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "John Maynard Keynes", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "DBS", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Gupta", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Singapore", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "DBS", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "year-over-year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "1.37 billion Singapore dollars", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the three months to June", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Reuters", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "1.47 billion Singapore dollars", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "DBS", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "almost 3 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Straits Times", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "1.45 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Gupta", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "J.P.

The banking business, including that of DBS, relies to some extent on confidence to do well, Gupta said. He added that \"unfortunately, there's not too much you can do about that and so you have to go with the cycle on that one.\" The Singapore-based lender on Thursday reported its second-quarter net profit that missed analyst expectations due to weaker trading income. DBS said its net profit rose 20 percent year-over-year to 1.37 billion Singapore dollars ($1 billion) in the three months to June. That was short of a Reuters estimate of 1.47 billion Singapore dollars. Shares of DBS traded almost 3 percent lower after the release of the earnings report. The bank is a heavyweight on the local benchmark Straits Times Index, which declined by 1.45 percent on Thursday. Gupta, however, said the bank's underlying business is still strong \u2014 a point shared by many analysts, including those from J.P. Morgan and PhillipCapital. \"I think what investors need to focus on is that our shortfall was really focused in the trading area ... That really is a function of the credit spreads widening in Asia, of a very flat yield curve and equity markets coming off very sharply in this quarter,\" said Gupta. \"The good news is underlying business momentum in our institutional businesses, the corporate banking business, consumer business, wealth business, all are extremely solid,\" he added.

Wilson's S&P year-end target is 2,750 \u2014 4 percent below the index's record high of 2,872 hit on Jan. 26 and about 3 percent from current levels. As for next year, he doesn't see the situation getting much better. \"There are definitely a lot of signs already that there's a view that things are going to slow materially next year whether there is a recession or not,\" Wilson said. \" However, he isn't bailing on stocks altogether.

The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency is still a far cry from playing the role of real money, according to global investment bank UBS. \"Bitcoin is still too unstable and limited to become a viable means of payment or a mainstream asset class,\" UBS strategist Joni Teves wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"Owing to its lack of price stability, bitcoin falls short of criteria that need to be satisfied to be considered money.\" Among its biggest roadblocks are recent dramatic price swings and some technological limits, according to UBS. The cryptocurrency's price has been marked by peaks and valleys this year. It often varies by hundreds of dollars in a single day and has fallen more than 60 percent since nearing a high of almost $20,000 in December. The digital currency was trading near $7,500 as of Thursday and has fallen roughly 50 percent in 2018, according to data from CoinDesk.

Since 2013, bitcoin's annual return has been 216 percent. In comparison, stocks and investment grade bonds have risen 16 percent and 1.6, respectively, according to UBS. On a risk adjusted basis though, bitcoin only modestly beat stocks, Teves found. Still, she said there is no certainty on whether bitcoin's past performance can be repeated. Teves also mentioned technical limits, and something known as scalability, size and speed. Changes by developers to address the issue have been \"insufficient,\" she said. \"Bitcoin cannot handle the volume of transactions processed by mechanisms being used in the real world,\" Teves said. UBS didn't completely rule out bitcoin's future as a form of payment. Teves outlined several conditions for it to become a \"legitimate asset class,\" including regulatory support with consumer safeguards.

About 30 of them belong to Revival Cycles, a high-end, custom motorcycle shop of which he is a co-founder. And about a dozen are part of Stulberg\u2019s personal collection. But one of the Stulberg's favorites is his Zero S Motorcycle, an electric street bike. \u201cThere\u2019s something so much more pure and so much better about an electric motorcycle,\u201d he told CNBC recently. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve ridden everything.\u201d The seasoned rider added that \u201cit\u2019s like flying without leaving the ground,\u201d speaking about the motorcycle that can go from zero to 103 miles an hour without shifting gears. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a superhero. All you hear is the wind and you\u2019re just floating down the road on this thing,\u201d he said. In an era where two and four-wheel electric vehicles are gaining momentum, iconic motorcycle brands like Harley-Davidson and Polaris are getting in on the action. In March, Harley invested in Silicon Valley startup Alta Motors and recently said it would bring an electric motorcycle to market by next year. Polaris's Indian Motorcycles announced it would have an electric bike within approximately the same time period. Still, what some riders appear to not realize is some brands have offered electric motorcycles for years. It\u2019s just that no one knows who they are. Coming to the party late Source: Zero Motocycles Zero Motorcycles, which opened up shop in 2006, is a niche electric brand . The privately-held, California-based company sells between 2,000 and 10,000 motorcycles a year, both domestically and internationally, and is growing fast, with a compounded annual growth rate of about 40 percent each year. Other electric motorcycle makers include KTM and Alta Motors. While electric bikes only take up a small portion of the motorcycle market at present, the electric motorcycle industry is expected to grow nearly 42 percent by 2021, according to a market research firm TechNavio. \u201cThere\u2019s an inevitability to electric continuing to grow as a percentage of global transportation,\u201d said Zero Motorcycles CEO Sam Paschel. \u201cThe question is, would you rather be early, having developed really robust technology and power-train systems? Or, would you rather come to that party a little late?\u201d In fact, electric vehicles have helped reshape the transportation industry globally, some experts pointed out. \u201cWhat Tesla showed with the Model S, was that once you have performance superiority and pricing parity, where there\u2019s product availability, the market shifts dramatically to electric,\u201d said Marc Fenigstein, Alta Motors co-founder and chief product officer. In the U.S., the vast majority of Zero sales are in West Coast cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, Paschel said, cities that already have the infrastructure to support them. At present electric motorcycles remain a niche market: Riders are typically city dwellers in their early 40s, slightly younger than the average age of a U.S. motorcycle rider \u2014 which is 47, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council\u2019s U.S. Motorcycle Owner Survey \u2014 and uses the bike to commute. The kind of people who \u201ctend to have both the discretionary income to go and just buy a brand new electric motorcycle and have the mindset to be an early adopter of technology,\" Paschel said. All you need is 'air in the tires' Source: Zero Motorcycles Zero sells street, off-road and duo-sport electric bikes, priced between $8,500 and $16,500. Alta Motors' and KTM's off-road electric bikes are between $8,000 and $10,000. Despite the slightly higher price tags \u2014 used gas-powered motorcycles can be as low as $1,000 to $2,000 \u2014 electric motorcycles have lower operating costs compared with gas engine bikes, since they don't need to be refueled or require regular oil changes. The engines also don't heat up as fast, which means the riders legs won\u2019t feel the heat next to an engine on extended rides, electric bikes are quieter than traditional motorcycles and some electric bikes don\u2019t have gears that need to be shifted. \u201cEssentially all you have to do is put air in the tires,\u201d Fenigstein said. In addition, younger consumers tend to prefer smaller, edgier motorcycles, which fit the electric bike model, said David Beckel, a senior analyst at Bernstein, who tracks companies like Harley. He said the problem with smaller brands like Zero is that the distribution is too low. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t resonate like a Harley,\u201d Beckel said. Zero has approximately 100 dealer locations in Europe and another 100 dealers in the U.S., and distributes products in more than 30 countries internationally, according to Paschel. That's still a far cry from the bigger brands: Last year, Harley-Davidson had 1498 dealers worldwide. \u201cA lot of investors point to Zero as why electric bikes won\u2019t last,\u201d Beckel said. But he said that if bigger brands like Harley-Davidson start to produce electric motorcycles, then awareness of the market and smaller brands would also increase. \"\u201cElectric motorcycles are quite a bit more approachable.If you\u2019re an amateur that doesn\u2019t know how to ride a motorcycle, you know how to ride a bike and you certainly can get on a little electric scooter and pull the throttle\" -Alan Stulberg, motorcyle enthusiast and shop owner Still, current interest in electric motorcycles is hard to ignore. Grant Dudson, an electric vehicle distributor, said he sees more and more people buzzing around his London home base on electric motorcycles and scooters, including people stopping him in the streets asking him about his electric bike. Meanwhile, an electric moped sharing service was launched in Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cElectric motorcycles are quite a bit more approachable,\" Stulberg said. \"If you\u2019re an amateur that doesn\u2019t know how to ride a motorcycle, you know how to ride a bike and you certainly can get on a little electric scooter and pull the throttle.\" Stulberg, who spends his days making custom-built gas motorcycles with six-figure price tags, said he sees a day when the majority of motorcycles are electric. \u201cIn 40 years, there\u2019ll be some segment of the motorcycle industry that thinks those internal combustion engine motorcycles are cool,\u201d Stulberg said. \u201cBut for the most part, those people are dinosaurs.\u201d Source: Zero Motorcycles The biggest drawback of electric motorcycles, critics say, is the range, or how long the bike can last before it needs to be recharged. Zero\u2019s largest capacity motorcycle, the Zero SR, can go about 223 miles on a single charge. A standard gasoline engine on a motorcycle can go around 300 miles on a single tank. But Corinna Mantlo, of Brooklyn, N.Y., said this makes it difficult to go on long treks across country on an electric motorcycle when there are no charging stations around. \u201cOnce you buy the bike you\u2019re on your own to figure out how to plug it in so you can keep using it,\" the veteran rider said. Mantlo liked the idea of electric motorcycles, but also said that without the infrastructure to support it, it\u2019s difficult to have one in a place like New York City. \u201cI live in a fifth floor walk-up,\u201d said Mantlo, who test road a Harley LiveWire back in 2014 while it was in New York. \u201cAm I going to pay $300 extra a month to have the parking spot outside my building and then run an extension cord from my window?\u201d she said. Paschel said Zero Motorcycles can be plugged into any 110 outlet nationwide, although the batteries last longer if charged on a traditional charging station. And as battery technology improves, range is expected to increase as well. \u201cNot everyone rides motorcycles to go on a 700-mile journey,\u201d said Stulberg who bought his Zero four years ago. \u201cMost people ride motorcycles 10 miles a day, to commute. Or, ride 50 miles in an afternoon. Or, maybe we\u2019ll take a 3-hour Sunday ride. That\u2019s a hundred miles and that enough on an electric motorcycle.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/11/105324310-1531340158288img_2995.jpg?v=1531340223", "time": "2018-08-05T23:22:10-0400", "author": "Source:\u00a0Will McDonough", "description": "CEO of iCash Will McDonough is part of a growing group of Wall Street alumni on the blockchain tech frontier.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/05/tom-brady-gary-cohn-and-marc-lasry-have-all-bet-on-will-mcdonough-h.html", "title": "Tom Brady, Gary Cohn, and Marc Lasry have all bet on Will McDonough.

dream. It was January 2005, and Tom Brady, Michael Jordan, Alex Rodriguez, Bill Clinton, Gary Cohn and Marc Lasry were among the group dining at the Japanese eatery after 18 holes at Jordan's celebrity golf tournament in the Bahamas. For most 25-year-olds, having a seat at this table would have been nothing short of a miracle \u2014 or at least, a once in a lifetime opportunity. For an up-and-comer named Will McDonough, who now calls some of those men \u201cbrothers,\u201d it helped get him hired as a rookie with a lackluster finance resume at some of the most respected firms on Wall Street. \u201cIt\u2019s still not lost on me how pretty damn cool that is,\u201d McDonough said in a recent interview. Now 38 years old, McDonough is taking center stage, leading his startup, iCash, through an initial coin offering that launched in mid-July. Already, iCash has attracted investments from the 1Confirmation Fund backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andresssen and Mark Cuban. It's also backed by Goldman Sachs alum Matthew Goetz's crypto hedge fund BlockTower. He joins a growing list of Wall Street alumni who have left the perceived safety of places like Goldman for the new frontier of technology known as the blockchain. McDonough is not used to talking about himself. In past interviews, the questions were often about his former bosses, the New England Patriots' star quarterback Tom Brady or former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn. That may all change if his gamble with iCash pays off. \u201cHe\u2019s acutely aware of where he is, that he\u2019s out on a frontier and he\u2019s aware that this could be a huge success,\u201d Cohn told CNBC. \u201cBut with opportunity for success comes risk of failure. He\u2019s not naively involved. He\u2019s very much in the world of reality, what could or couldn\u2019t be the outcomes.\u201d McDonough\u2019s path hasn't been typical for Wall Street. He never had a finance internship. He didn\u2019t go to an Ivy League school, study economics, or pivot to an MBA. He started out as New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady\u2019s manager. The Patriots McDonough, who looks and sounds like a distant Kennedy relative, was a sports buff as a boy. As a sophomore at Westwood High School in suburban Boston he landed a gig at local sports radio station WEEI. At 16 years old, he showed up on his first day and was asked to drive the company van down Boylston Street to Fenway Park and hand out flyers. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell them I didn\u2019t have my license,\u201d he said. \u201cI just figured it out.\u201d He made it to Fenway that day, and ended up working at the radio station on its promotions team, eventually setting up microphones and running wires for a famous Boston Globe sports reporter, who also happened to be named Will McDonough. As a freshman at Boston College, the younger McDonough started working for the Patriots, and after graduation joined the organization full-time. There, the 2002 graduate found himself working in the team's corporate affairs group at the same time a lanky, sixth-round draft pick named Tom Brady was ascending to the top of the NFL. McDonough won over Brady's trust, something a former teammate and the current coach of the Tennessee Titans said was hard to do. \u201cWe\u2019d see Will around Foxborough, he\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, you need help with anything? Do you want to get into this bar, or this club?\u2019 \u2013 you just start to trust him over the course of time as a guy who was really looking to help,\u201d said former All-Pro Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel. As Brady became a household name in New England, McDonough transitioned from the team's public affairs group to the quarterback's first full-time manager. In the early days, the job centered around making sure Brady could focus on football after being \u201cthrust into a whole new world of stardom,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cI would only approach him on non-football things one day a week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt matured into me negotiating sponsorship deals for him from my own network.\u201d Brady makes $8 million a year in sponsorships, according to Forbes' latest estimates. Among those is an Under Armour deal, which McDonough says he helped broker by introducing Brady to the apparel-maker's founder and CEO, Kevin Plank. McDonough's ability to network was tested as he traveled the world \u201con Brady\u2019s hip\u201d in 2005, which brought him to the dinner at Nobu that fateful evening. He recalled joking with billionaire and Avenue Capital founder Marc Lasry about the absurdity of the Nobu guest list and how \u201cguys like us\u201d were the glue that got groups like that at the same table. That conversation made an impression on Lasry, who recruited McDonough to his own firm in 2008. \u201cWill was deciding to change careers and leave the Patriots, I convinced him to come join us,\u201d Lasry told CNBC. With no economics degree (he was marketing and pre-law-at Boston College), McDonough took an entry level job at the global investment firm Avenue Capital, which had $9.4 billion of assets under management as of February. \u201cWe ended up putting him in business development, and it turned out to be a great decision on our end,\u201d Lasry said. \u201cFor a kid who had not been in finance he\u2019s done really well.\u201d Goldman Sachs While at Avenue, McDonough came into contact with then-Goldman president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn when he was pitching a deal the investment firm had previously done with Morgan Stanley. As Cohn recalled, the two had originally met years earlier when McDonough accompanied Tom Brady to a lunch near Goldman's office in downtown Manhattan. And once while in a private box at a Patriot's game, Cohn was able to observe McDonough's ability to fit into multiple crowds \u2013 he was able to bounce from conversations with CEOs, to running backs, to wait staff, Cohn said. \u201cThis is a unique skill set I see in only the best sales people I have ever had work for me,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cWill was the most unbelievable people-management person \u2014 I could see he could fit in well in any crowd.\u201d The Cohn connection led McDonough to one of Wall Street's coveted jobs: Vice President at Goldman. Joining the bank in 2010, he was put in a group that handled private investments for Goldman partners, a role that straddled divisions and allowed McDonough to closely observe the firm's high profile deals, including Facebook\u2019s IPO. Investing in Africa At Goldman, McDonough was partly tasked with diversifying partners\u2019 financial exposure into things other than company stock. One area that piqued his interest was Africa. He was approached by a World Bank executive with an idea to buy banks in Africa through what's known as a SPAC, or a special purpose acquisition company. In a SPAC, an investment company is formed through an initial public offering, or IPO, and those proceeds are used to buy one or more existing companies. Goldman didn't want to participate, McDonough said, so he left the bank in 2013 to pursue the opportunity full-time. He teamed up with former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, who at the time was looking for his next gig, and former EcoBank Africa CEO Arnold Ekpe. The group launched Atlas Mara, which went public a year later on the London Stock Exchange. Because of the way SPACs work, McDonough's affiliation with Atlas Mara ended after the IPO, which he says is one of his biggest regrets. \u201cThat\u2019s been the biggest lesson learned \u2014 you need to be control of a project you pitch, you can\u2019t leave that subject to outside things you can\u2019t control,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cAll you have is your word.\u201d Ekpe went on to work with McDonough in Nigeria while consulting for Uber. The ride-sharing giant was looking expand its presence in Africa by finding a way to help drivers finance cars, and co-founder Travis Kalanick tapped McDonough for the job. According to Ekpe, McDonough had the same effect on his African colleagues as he seemingly did on Goldman's Cohn. \"He has an ability to connect with people, to put things in very simple and convincing terms,\" he said. \"My team was quite taken with him.\" Betting on blockchain Another regret, McDonough said, was dismissing bitcoin to a friend who sought his advice about it 2013, well before the cryptocurrency gained almost household name status. It had been gaining attention in online communities like Reddit at the time. \u201cI felt bad I shouldn\u2019t have just written it off \u2014 people tend to listen to me, and I gave him a perspective hadn\u2019t done much research on,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cI called my friend back two weeks later and said I was wrong.\u201d But he saw more value in bitcoin's underlying technology, known as blockchain, and was especially taken with what are known as \u201csmart contracts.\u201d He dove into learning about the technology, taking notes. On the right column of each piece of note paper, he wrote down reasons big institutions and folks like Gary Cohn wouldn\u2019t invest. In a smart contract, a deal can automatically settle or be verified without a third party. Two people agree on terms, or the inputs, ahead of time and the contract gets settled automatically. These transactions, like most on blockchain, are irreversible and can\u2019t be tampered with, which is a bonus in some cases. But in others, if there\u2019s an error by somebody on the input side, it can be disastrous. McDonough uses the example of the equation A+B=C. The math can be right but the input \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d can still be wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s no layer that allows for assurance that the inputs are accurate,\u201d McDonough said. His company iCash is looking to solve that issue, and is an additional \u201clayer\u201d of code embedded on top of the blockchain. It\u2019s what he describes as the added \u201care you sure?\u201d button. Source: iCash Will McDonough, founder and CEO of iCash. The company is raising money through an initial coin offering, a fundraising technique that has brought in more than $12 billion globally this year, according to data firm Autonomous Next. Blockchain's potential has been compared to the internet but so has its hype. Even McDonough said it's a \"sexy\" term used by companies that might not truly involved, those that might not have taken social media seriously, or are \"self conscious\" from missing out on the web 2.0. In some well-publicized cases, even adding the word \"blockchain\" to a public company's name can send the stock skyrocketing. Multiple venture capitalists and investors, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak have pointed out similarities to the early 2000 internet mania. Union Square Ventures, a firm with numerous investments in cryptocurrency projects, is wary of that. While investors are \"rationally\" pouring money into the sector, and the winning blockchain could be worth trillions, one managing partner at Union Square Ventures predicts that many more will fail. \"Either you develop one of those winning protocols or you don't, in which case your value will probably be zero,\" said Albert Wenger, managing partner at the venture capital firm. \"In this particular field, the stuff that actually works will float to the top, it might take a while.\" McDonough says he's equally aware and is betting his career, and hard-earned trust of investors that iCash will be among those that floats to the top. \u201cI\u2019ve measured three times over, I\u2019ve gone deep and put the time in to really understand the underlying technology,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust is the most important thing you have to return \u2014 people know that if I\u2019m putting something in front of them, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve vetted.\u201d "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/12/13/104164049-GettyImages-106456965.jpg?v=1538673826", "time": "2018-08-04T14:06:20-0400", "author": "Getty Images", "description": "Steve Chiavarone predicts stocks will fall 5 to 8 percent before summer ends.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/04/one-of-markets-biggest-bulls-makes-sell-off-prediction.html", "title": "One of market\u2019s biggest bulls takes a \u2018few chips off the table,\u2019 sees impending sell-off\u00a0", "keywords": [{"term": "One", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "\u2019s", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "5:04 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "3", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Aug 2018", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "01:23 One", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Federated Investors'", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Steve Chiavarone", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "5 to 8 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "before summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Friday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trading Nation", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "election years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the summer months", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Chiavarone", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "September", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Federal Reserve", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Chiavarone", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "year-end", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "3,100", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "almost 9 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Fed", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "2019", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the fourth quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Vote Vote", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "a Scientific Survey", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "100%", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4:54 PM ET Fri", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "3", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Aug 2018", "category": "DATE"}], "body": " show chapters One of market\u2019s biggest bulls goes on sell-off watch 5:04 PM ET Fri, 3 Aug 2018 | 01:23 One of the market's biggest bulls is on sell-off watch.

J.P. Morgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon says people should prepare for U.S. yields of 5 percent, warning investors that borrowing costs throughout the economy are likely to rise beyond even his prior forecasts. Though the bank chief previously theorized that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note could reach 4 percent in 2018, his comments Saturday at the Aspen Institute's 25th Annual Summer Celebration Gala appeared to reflect his belief in a stronger economy. \"I think rates should be 4 percent today,\" Dimon said. \"You better be prepared to deal with rates 5 percent or higher \u2014 it's a higher probability than most people think.\" show chapters Watch CNBC's exclusive interview with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon 5:14 PM ET Mon, 30 July 2018 | 11:23 The rate on the closely followed 10-year note remains below the 3 percent level despite Dimon's expectations; it fluttered above the threshold last week before slipping back to 2.95 percent by Monday morning. The yield has struggled to stay above the 3 percent level despite a U.S. unemployment rate below 4 percent, gross domestic product above 4 percent and a swell in government stimulus in the form of tax cuts and big spending. Some economists have hypothesized that while the economic indicators may seem healthy for the moment, the long-term outlook looks less robust and that yields of longer duration reflect a more modest growth expectation. The 10-year yield is a benchmark that influences rates for mortgages and auto loans, among other things. So, the higher the 10-year goes, the higher mortgage rates and auto loans are. If they rise, consumers may be less likely to take out those loans, thus putting some economic growth at risk. \"Our takeaway has been that a ballooning deficit at the end of a cycle (rather than to work the economy out of a recession) poses more economic downside risks than upside for Treasury yields,\" Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said in an emailed statement Monday. \"Investors will grapple with the apparent disconnect between the lowest unemployment rate since 2000 ahead of the largest 10-year auction ever ($26 billion) and the inability of yields in the sector to sustainably break 3.0 percent,\" he added. \"We'll argue there is far less inconsistency when considering the broader context of wage and consumer inflation.\" Still, Dimon remains bullish on the economy and reiterated this weekend what he told CNBC in June: that \"there is nothing that is a real pothole\" to economic success at the moment. \"Business sentiment is almost at the highest level it's ever been, consumer sentiment is at its highest levels, markets are wide open, housing's in short supply and my guess is mortgage credit will expand a little bit,\" Dimon said at the time. \"If you look at how the table's set, consumers are in very good shape.\" \"So,\" he concluded. \"It looks pretty good.\" WATCH: St. Louis Fed president: US yield curve sending a signal on rates show

& Bushnell Manufacturing facility in Bushnell, Illinois. The U.S. government reported that the manufacturing sector added 37,000 jobs during July, pushing the industry to the best annual job gain in more than 20 years. Over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995. The sector received a boost from President Donald Trump's corporate tax cut and a lift in overall economic activity. \"With 157,000 jobs created in July, including 37,000 in manufacturing, this report shows tax reform and regulatory relief are continuing to deliver for America's manufacturing workers,\" Carolyn Lee, executive director of the National Association of Manufacturers' Manufacturing Institute, said in an emailed statement. \"Congress and the administration have taken important steps in recent weeks to tackle this challenge, but this jobs report is a reminder that more work needs to be done through partnerships with the private sector to solve the workforce crisis facing manufacturing in the United States,\" she added. Indeed, economic data shows that U.S. manufacturers are producing near record levels. Last year, U.S. manufacturers produced about $6 trillion in gross output, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The biggest categories were food, beverages and tobacco products ($1 trillion), chemical products ($837 billion) and motor vehicles and parts ($701 billion). But while job growth has been strong lately, the total number of manufacturing employees is well off the sector's heyday, a fraction of what it once was. Stephen Roach, an economics professor at Yale University and former chief economist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC that despite the political focus on manufacturing, its role in the American economy continues to wane. Manufacturing payrolls, Roach said, comprise only 8.5 percent of the U.S. total, down from above 30 percent in decades past. \"The manufacturing jobs numbers continue to show solid momentum, but this is not the sector that will make a major difference for American workers,\" Roach said. \"There's been a dramatic shift due to automation, machine productivity and the shifting of jobs to China and other countries with lower input costs.\" \"It's a political ploy by the President who wants to 'Make American Great Again,'\" he added. \"This is politics, not realistic assessment of economic outcomes.\" While manufacturing increased in absolute terms, it still represents a smaller share of the economy than it used to. The sector represented 11.6 percent of U.S. GDP in 2017, down from 12.3 percent in 2011 and 28.1 percent in 1953. Manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979 at 19.4 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The apparent paradox between record levels of output and a decline in workers shows that American manufacturers have become far more productive over the years \u2014 said differently, they can produce more or higher-value goods with less labor. The Labor Department's index of labor productivity for manufacturing is more than double what it was at the beginning of 1987, likely reflecting an economy-wide investment in machinery, a more educated workforce and a rebirth in technology and big data, helping companies improve performance in a variety of tasks, ranging from assembly to tailored marketing and advertisement. A report by the World Economic Forum and Boston Consulting released in January found that nearly 1 million Americans will see their occupations vanish entirely by 2026 and will have to attain new skills to meet the demands of the marketplace.

On Friday, China said it was preparing retaliatory measures against U.S. tariffs targeting $60 billion worth of U.S. goods with import duties. America's European allies will likely be nervous Monday as Washington gears up to re-impose sanctions on Iran that were overturned by an historic nuclear deal in 2015. The duties will affect Iranian products including automobiles and metals.

and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R). While few European states can pretend to share Germany's distinction of being a \"country of poets and thinkers,\" none can rival German abilities to extract so much wealth from the rest of the European Union. Last year, Germany posted a 159.3 billion euro surplus on its goods trade with other countries in the EU \u2014 one of the world's largest free-trade areas and a region with privileged access to German goods and services. That's the way it's been since 1958, when Europe's common market opened up. Germany's enormous EU bounty consistently accounts for two-thirds of its net foreign trade income in a market structure where Berlin remains an undisputed leader and a principal regulator. This year looks set to mark another record-high EU trade income for Germany. The surplus during the January-April period was running at an annual rate of 175 billion euro \u2014 a 10 percent increase on the country's EU trades in 2017 \u2014 according to statistics from Germany's Bundesbank. A country representing 28 percent of the monetary union's economy and living so grandly off the rest of its partners is a structurally destabilizing factor. Right policies are no handouts To this day, economists pointing out that fundamental problem have been ridiculed as hopelessly naive because, as the mantra goes, the European project has always been, and always will be, a political construct to keep the Europeans off each other's throats. That charge is not only false, but it also bears the seeds of its own destruction. Taking hundreds of billions of euros of purchasing power out of the monetary union, Germany makes it virtually impossible for other euro area economies to grow and create jobs as they struggle to bring down their public debts and deficits. Instead of accumulating enormous wealth on the back of its euro partners, Germany should stimulate its domestic spending to buy more goods and services from them. At the same time, Germany can relieve its growing labor shortages by offering jobs to more than 17 million EU people that are currently looking for work and a meaningful future. And there is more: Recycling some of last year's roughly $300 billion trade surplus \u2014 through direct investments in the rest of the EU \u2014 Germany would boost economic growth and employment in other countries in the bloc, solve the problem of its shrinking manpower and adjust its overflowing external accounts. Those would be appropriate economic policies for a country running large and systematic trade surpluses. Such policies would also even out the intra-area growth dynamics and stabilize the monetary union in a more homogeneous manner. And none of that would be actions of EU solidarity loathed by the tight-fisted German government. It is no wonder that the \"everyone for themselves\" attitudes have led to the revival of nationalism, alienation from the European project and an increasing popularity of \"my country first\" slogans \u2014 even in places like Italy, where the traditional idea of a united, peaceful and prosperous Europe inspired generations. Dwindling support for Merkel's coalition Germany's dogmatic imposition of fiscal austerity on recession-ridden EU countries and its frightening handling of Greece have been painful examples of absurd and insensitive policies. It has also strengthened the hand of Euro-skeptic political movements, such as the \"Italy First\" government in Rome which is hostile to the EU. The last straw was the German attempt to dump its self-inflicted and unmanageable immigration problems on the rest of the EU. What we are seeing now is that what goes around comes around. The mismanagement of the EU economy and the calamitous immigration blunders have led to Germany's escalating political crises. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative alliance, made up of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Socialist Party (CSU) \u2014 together unofficially known as the Union \u2014 is falling apart. The latest opinion polls, reported last Thursday, show that the Union finds favor with only 29 percent of voters \u2014 a record low and down one percentage point from a previous poll in early July. The Union's coalition partner, SPD (The Social Democratic Party of Germany), remained at its record low of 18 percent, which means that only 47 percent of Germans are ready to vote for the current government coalition. Germany now has a federal government with a dismal approval rating of 25 percent in a recent poll and no parliamentary majority if an election were called today. Particularly serious is the situation with the CSU party, which two months before the elections in Bavaria on October 14, was polling at 39 percent and looked almost certain to lose control of the state government. A new, and probably terminal, government crisis could erupt at any moment. Merkel keeps insisting on a \"European solution\" \u2014 which does not exist \u2014 to an intractable immigration problem she created. Her bitter opponent, the powerful Interior Minister and leader of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, wants a radical and expedient \"national solution\" because the neighboring states Austria and Italy don't want to cooperate for fear of getting stuck with migrants that Germany intends to throw out. Investment thoughts The historian Ludwig Dehio famously said that, after the founding of the German empire in 1871, Germany was \"too strong for a balanced Europe, but too weak to dominate the continent.\" Mercifully, the dilemma that led to two world wars in the last century seems to be a thing of the past as a result of the EU. What is missing is a German leadership deeply committed to the European project as was the case with previous chancellors such as Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, who helped usher in European reconciliation and set Europe on the way to a common currency. Under the current leadership, Germany is a weakened and deeply divided country. Its excessive, by far the world's largest, trade surpluses are a burden on its EU partners. Its economic policies are not conducive to stability, growth and employment creation within the monetary union and beyond. We have to hope that the next generation of German leaders will understand that it is in their best interest to run a more balanced economy that will promote shared prosperity for the EU as a whole.

CBS CEO Les Moonves had the chance Thursday to speak to the investor community about allegations of sexual misconduct stemming from an eight-month investigation by Ronan Farrow for The New Yorker. Instead of addressing the claims, he chose to remain silent. He talked about advertising growth and streaming video and direct-to-consumer platforms \u2014 everything but the elephant in the room. In doing so, he actually made a statement, loud and clear: I'm not backing down from anything. \"In light of pending litigation and other matters, and on the advice of counsel, the scope of today's call and any questions will be limited to the quarterly results of the company,\" CBS Executive Vice President of corporate finance and investor relations Adam Townsend said before Moonves began speaking. Equity analysts who cover CBS are taking heat because they declined to press Moonves during the question and answer portion of the call about his future with the company. Even BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield, who wasn't called on by management, called the display by his peers \"shameful.\" Moonves has already admitted he's done at least something wrong in the New Yorker story. \"I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career.\" (The New Yorker story then proceeds to illustrate several allegations of Moonves misusing his position to harm and hinder careers.) So why was Moonves on the call in the first place? It's a show of force from a person who is secure enough (or wants to seem secure enough) that he can proceed in a \"business as usual\" fashion without repercussion. One public relations chief, who wouldn't speak on the record because of potential conflicts, said having Moonves participate on the call yesterday could only lead to a circus. A CBS spokesman declined to comment on why Moonves chose to be on the call. But it appears CBS's near-term strategy is to simply ignore the story. Earlier this week, the CBS board met to decide what to do about the allegations. The result? An announcement that they'd hired law firms to conduct their own independent investigation. This approach of stubborn resistance helped Moonves keep his job when he balked at controlling shareholder Shari Redstone's attempt to put CBS and Viacom together earlier this year. Then he took it one step further, pushing to dilute Redstone's voting control over the company from 80 percent to 17 percent. \"He's betting he can swing enough board votes his way and proceed with the lawsuit,\" said Eric Jackson, Founder and President of EMJ Capital Ltd. The #MeToo movement has taken down several CEOs -- Harvey Weinstein, Steve Wynn, and even Intel's Brian Krzanich, who stepped down after having a consensual relationship with a subordinate. More than 400 \"high-profile executives and employees across fields and industries have been outed by the #MeToo Movement in 18 months,\" according to crisis consulting firm Temin & Co. But if Moonves, 68, was concerned about losing his job over #MeToo, he likely would have taken an easier exit. He could have said yes to a deal with Viacom and retired as part of the transaction, before The New Yorker story appeared. But he fought the deal, even reportedly knowing Farrow's article was in the works. That suggests he thinks he can beat this. His actions on the earnings call were more of the same. show chapters CBS is not 'business as usual', says David Faber 10:36 AM ET Fri, 3 Aug 2018 | 04:25 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/08/03/105374699-1533303961230gettyimages-496014862.jpeg?v=1533304034", "time": "2018-08-03T17:01:18-0400", "author": "Patrick T.

HSBC's chief executive, John Flint, said the results are in line with expectations. \"This is creating room to invest while maintaining our commitment to full-year positive adjusted jaws,\" he said in a statement accompanying the results announcement. show chapters HSBC meeting immediate expectations with operating profit up: Analyst 1:32 AM ET Mon, 6 Aug 2018 | 04:07 Flint announced in June that the bank plans to spend an additional $15 billion to $17 billion on areas including \"growth and technology\" between 2018 and 2020. Doing so would grow the bank's cost base by \"low-to-mid-single digit percentages each year until the end of 2020,\" Flint said. The Asia-focused bank also gave an update on its $2 billion share buyback program announced in May. HSBC said, as of June 30, $1 billion of shares had been bought back and canceled. Analysts had been optimistic that the bank would make a turnaround in its bottom line. Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities, said earlier he expects HSBC to report a 5 percent gain in pre-tax profit for the six months ended June. \"I think they can make a turnaround and rebound quite significantly,\" Wong told CNBC's Emily Tan on Monday ahead of the bank's results announcement. \"First of all, we see a clear tendency everywhere, not just in Hong Kong, for interest margin to be improving. And also, HIBOR is on a good track, so I think HSBC can make a comeback after the slight drop in the first quarter,\" he added. HIBOR, or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, is the benchmark interest rate in the city. The indicator tracks interest rates in the U.S. and has been trending upward this year. HSBC has undergone years of restructuring to grow its business again. The bank has had several leadership changes in the past year, with Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO John Flint taking over less than a year ago. Tucker, in a statement accompanying the financial statement, said the board has appointed Jonathan Symonds as deputy group chairman.

David Solomon, Goldman Sachs' incoming CEO, is wasting no time getting his house in order.

Esposito, a partner who was co-chief operating officer of the bank's fixed income business, will join Ashok Varadhan as leaders of the trading organization, one of the largest on Wall Street. In June, Varadhan's former co-heads Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet departed \u2014 leaving at least one opening at the top of the business, which is typically led by two or more executives. The two trading co-heads will be charged with helping the firm \u2014 once Wall Street's most profitable trading house \u2014 regain some of its former glory. While Goldman traders produced about $33 billion in revenue in 2009, the firm has struggled to adjust to the post-financial crisis environment, and it produced only about a third of that amount last year. In the meantime, rivals including J.P. Morgan have gained market share, helped by a more diverse set of clients than Goldman. In other cases, competitors have revamped business by cutting traders, such as Morgan Stanley's move to cut one-fourth of its bond division in late 2015. Esposito has previously served as chief strategy officer of the securities division, and co-head of global fixed income sales. He joined Goldman in 1995 as a salesman for emerging markets debt.

Square's bitcoin service may not be a huge money-maker yet, but a little-known change from last quarter could turn it into a more sophisticated trading platform going forward. Square disclosed in its latest quarterly report that it's now trading bitcoin through \"private broker dealers\" instead of \"public cryptocurrency exchanges\" for its Cash app, which facilitates all of its bitcoin transactions. That means most of Square's bitcoin trading comes from private, over-the-counter (OTC) desks as opposed to the open, public exchanges. The change, which was first disclosed this week, is a step towards offering a more professional bitcoin trading service, cryptocurrency experts say. By moving off of public exchanges, and trading through OTC channels, Square is able to build a faster and more secure platform that would create less price volatility when trading large amounts of bitcoin, experts say. Square declined to comment on this story. \"Working with a broker likely gets Square better pricing and better execution services than floating orders on the open market, as well as more confidentiality,\" said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, a cryptocurrency investment firm. Public exchanges are prone to hacks, as seen in a series of attacks in recent years that cost users tens of millions of dollars. Their transactions also take a long time \u2014 often hours, or even days \u2014 as they can't trade instantly. Also, most exchanges have open order books, giving competitors room to track transactions and exploit them. Moving to OTC platforms can solve many of these problems, according to Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, a company that runs a cryptocurrency index fund. Trades can run faster as they don't require cash or bitcoin to be deposited in the platform before placing an order, while transactions are more secure, he said. Orders also remain private, providing more secrecy around Square's market activity. \"There are many merits to trading OTC, which might be motivating Square's switch,\" Hunter said. Price \"slippage\" But perhaps the biggest advantage of moving to an OTC is protection from what's called price \"slippage.\" Slippage happens when an investor sells a large chunk of bitcoin at once on a public exchange, causing the bitcoin price on the exchange to fall as the order is placed. By the time the order is filled, the investor could end up selling at a lower price than intended. Horsley said a bitcoin order worth a few million dollars could often cause a 5 to 10 percent price slippage on a public exchange. But that number improves to a 0.5 to 2 percent slippage rate on an OTC desk, he said, allowing Square to move blocks of bitcoin in one big transaction. \"Prices, net of fees, are often better, especially for large orders,\" he said. The move off exchanges was also likely motivated by a desire to be more compliant, said Demirors of CoinShare. The nature of Square's business draws a lot of scrutiny from regulators and banks, and partnering with OTC desks and private brokers, who are generally perceived as \"far lower risk,\" can work in its favor, she said. It's unclear which OTCs have partnered with Square so far. In June, Genesis Trading, a bitcoin brokerage firm owned by Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, announced its partnership with Square, shortly after Square secured a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Square first launched its bitcoin trading service to limited people in the fourth quarter of 2017, and made it publicly available in the first quarter of this year. Both Bitcoin's price and Square's share price jumped after the launch of its bitcoin service. Despite these moves, Square isn't making much money from its bitcoin service. In the second quarter, Square made about $400,000 in profit on $37 million of revenue from bitcoin transactions. That's a slight improvement from the quarter before, when it made a profit of $200,000 off $34 million in bitcoin revenue. During an earnings call with reporters on Wednesday, Square CFO Sarah Friar said that the bitcoin service isn't expected to be a huge growth driver anytime soon. \"It's not a major monetization engine,\" Friar said. \"The goal is to continue to drive utility in the Cash app.\" show chapters Square beats top line estimates 4:35 PM ET Wed, 1 Aug 2018 | 01:02 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/08/104997948-GettyImages-477466526.jpg?v=1533320665", "time": "2018-08-03T14:56:13-0400", "author": "Kena Bentacur |  Getty Images", "description": "Doug Ramsey of The Leuthold Group says that the S&P 500's price-to-sales ratio is around 2.2, near the highs seen in early 2000.

By one measure, stocks are as pricey as they were before the dotcom bubble burst, and that should give investors pause moving forward, according to Doug Ramsey of The Leuthold Group. The firm's chief investment officer said in a note Friday that the S&P 500's price-to-sales ratio is around 2.2, near the highs seen in early 2000. The price-to-sales ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's stock price to its revenue. The higher it goes, theoretically the more expensive the stock is. \"For the last year, we have labeled the S&P 500 Price/Sales ratio\u2014which has returned to its Y2K bubble levels\u2014the 'scariest chart in our database,'\" Ramsey wrote. \"Recall that the initial visit to present levels was followed by the S&P 500's first-ever negative total return decade.\" The price-to-sales ratio is not the most popular valuation metric on Wall Street but it may be one that is least likely to be manipulated. Most professional investors look at the price-to-earnings ratio, which measures a company's price against its profit. However, some experts argue earnings can be manipulated through different friendly accounting practices. Equity valuations rose sharply during the dotcom bubble as investors poured money into several nonprofitable internet companies. Once the bubble burst, many of these companies folded and the stock market lost half of its value as all of them plummeted in value. This year, the S&P 500 is up more than 6 percent and reached an all-time high in late January. But Ramsey said the overvaluation today may be worse than during the bubble, noting the median S&P 500 price-to-sales ratio for specific companies today is more than double than it was in February of 2000. \"The nature of this market's overvaluation is very different than in 2000,\" he said. \"Overvaluation in 2000 was highly concentrated; today it is pervasive.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/08/06/105377683-1533556562069gettyimages-498677988.jpeg?v=1533556679", "time": "2018-08-06T07:57:36-0400", "author": "Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images", "description": "Amazon says it has paid all taxes required in the U.K. and every country that it operates in.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/amazon-slammed-for-uk-corporation-tax-bill-despite-record-profits.html", "title": "Amazon slammed for \u2018insult\u2019 tax bill in the UK despite record profits", "keywords": [{"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the previous year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Thursday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Britain", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "\u00a34.6 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$6 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "almost half", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "\u00a37.4 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "$9.6 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2016", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "just $1.7 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Chris Ratcliffe", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Bloomberg", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Amazon.com Inc.", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Hemel Hempstead", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Amazon U.K. Services Ltd", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "about \u00a324.3 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "almost \u00a372.4 million", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "last week", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$2.5 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the third consecutive quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "$1 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Britain", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "19 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "17 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "2020", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "The Tax Justice Network", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "U.K.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "around 27,000", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "U.K", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "84 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "the past two years", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Amazon", "category": "ORG"}], "body": " Amazon has been criticized for paying less corporation tax in the U.K. in 2017 than it did the previous year. The tech giant disclosed in a filing Thursday that its corporate tax bill in Britain was around \u00a34.6 million ($6 million) last year, almost half the \u00a37.4 million ($9.6 million) it paid in 2016. The amount actually paid was just $1.7 million, due to tax deferrals. Amazon says it has paid all taxes required in the U.K. and every country that it operates in. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee pushes a trolley along an aisle at the Amazon.com Inc. fulfillment center in Hemel Hempstead, U.K. The filing was made by Amazon U.K. Services Ltd, a division of the company devoted to warehouses and logistics operations. It also showed that the e-commerce firm's pre-tax profits in the U.K. leaped from about \u00a324.3 million to almost \u00a372.4 million. Amazon as a whole posted its highest ever quarterly profit last week, reporting a net income of $2.5 billion. It marked the third consecutive quarter in which the company surpassed $1 billion in profits. In Britain, corporations are required to pay 19 percent of their profits in tax. The government wants to lower this to a rate of 17 percent by 2020. The Tax Justice Network, an anti-tax avoidance advocacy group based in the U.K., criticized the lower tax payment, calling it an \"insult.\" \"It clearly shows that our global tax system is fundamentally broken and needs urgently fundamental reform,\" the organization told CNBC via email. \"Otherwise, small and medium enterprises will be ruined at the expense of global players who are most aggressive in pushing down their tax rates and controlling ever more market share.\" The activist group said large multinational firms should be forced to report their financial activities on a country-by-country basis. A spokesperson for Amazon said in statement: \"Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly-competitive, low margin business and our continued heavy investment.\" Amazon has around 27,000 employees in the U.K and it grants full-time staffers share awards, which the company says reduce its tax liability. Amazon's share price has increased 84 percent in the past two years. The news could embolden critics of Amazon who claim the firm and other tech giants are not paying enough tax. President Donald Trump for instance has attacked Amazon frequently, claiming the company pays \"little or no taxes to state and local governments.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/16/104848073-campus_of_Harvard_Law_School.jpg?v=1533311550", "time": "2018-08-03T12:04:05-0400", "author": "Brooks Kraft | Corbis | Getty Images", "description": "Hedge funds are battling with other industries searching for top talent and projecting an image that appeals to a new generation, by becoming cool, The Financial Times reports.\u00a0", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/hedge-funds-fight-back-against-tech-in-the-war-for-talent.html", "title": "Hedge funds fight back against tech in the war for talent", "keywords": [{"term": "Corbis", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Getty Images Students", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Harvard Law School", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Cambridge", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Mario Roussanov", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "annual", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "this year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "4 weeks", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "just $1", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "150,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Roussanov", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Selby Jennings", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "New York", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Hedge", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Connecticut", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Manhattan", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "one", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "the London Business School", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "6 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "the past decade", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "46 per cent", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "2007", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "26", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "last year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Matthew Granade", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Steve Cohen's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "$13bn", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Mr Granade", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "One", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "six", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "seven", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "three", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "a few years ago", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Granade", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "PhD", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Roussanov", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the end of the year", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "five to 10 years'", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Richard Wu", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Citadel", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Ken Griffin's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "30bn", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Citadel", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "25,000", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "Citadel", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Wu", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the University of Waterloo", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Canada", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "summer", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the hours", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "Google", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Shopify", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Citadel", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the Financial Times", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Dan Loeb's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Third", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "PayPal", "category": "ORG"}], "body": " Brooks Kraft | Corbis | Getty Images Students on the campus of Harvard Law School in Cambridge, MA. As Mario Roussanov, a recruiter for hedge funds, began making his annual visit to clients this year, the change was apparent. Cubicles had been replaced by open-plan layouts, workers were increasingly donning jeans and casual shirts at places that once favored suits and ties, kitchens were fully stocked with food for employees, and pods, libraries and other quiet spaces to think had popped up. Just like other industries competing for the top computer science talent, hedge funds are projecting an image that appeals to a new generation. The development is forcing a traditionally secretive industry into an unusual position: having to promote itself, and become cool. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. The office revamp is all part of that plan, as hedge funds vie with technology companies for recruits who have expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data analytics, many of whom are garnering salaries of $150,000 or more straight out of university. \"A lot have gone down the Google route to offer more perks,\" said Mr Roussanov, who works for the recruitment firm Selby Jennings in New York. \"They're trying to rebrand themselves as tech firms.\" He added: \"They're telling recruits, 'We're tackling challenging problems with data'. They're emphasising more of the problems they are facing that need to be solved, rather than what they're trying to achieve.\" Hedge funds have always been the outliers in the finance industry, more dressed-down than investment bankers, and content to have offices in Connecticut over Manhattan, but they have also rarely been in a position where they had to seek out talent. They paid the best, and traders clamoured to work for one. But tech firms can now often offer just as much, and recent graduates who are in demand are seeking work they feel has purpose. At the London Business School, the percentage of graduates going to work in tech has jumped from 6 per cent to 20 per cent over the past decade, and those entering finance fell from 46 per cent in 2007 to 26 per cent last year. While quantitative investing funds, which trade using computer algorithms, have been on the forefront of hiring these types of candidates, other hedge funds that rely on humans to make trading decisions are increasingly upping their quantitative capabilities in order to analyse reams of data faster. Besides the increasing amount of perks funds are trying to offer, like revamping their workplace and offering services such as free dry-cleaning, they are emphasising the amount of money they are willing to spend on technology and the complexity of the problems in financial markets to entice recruits. \"The pitch is . . . this is a very data-rich environment, and it's a phenomenally well-resourced environment,\" said Matthew Granade, the chief market intelligence officer at Point72, Steve Cohen's $13bn hedge fund. For the people Mr Granade calls \"data learning, quant types\", the harder the problem, the better. \"The benefit for us is that the markets are one of the hardest problems in the world. You think you've found a solution and then everyone else catches up. The markets are always adapting. So you are constantly being presented with new challenges, and the problem is constantly getting harder.\" Some hedge fund managers privately scoff at the idea that working at a tech firm is more worthy. One executive who asked not to be named dismissed the notion that \"there's a great holy mission in being at Google or Facebook. Going there just means doing advertising more efficiently.\" A star candidate now is likely to have six or seven offers, where it used to be two or three a few years ago, said Mr Granade. They are usually deciding between an offer from a hedge fund, a big bank, a couple of tech firms and whether to continue at university to get their PhD, he said. Hedge funds are now starting to put together better offers than tech firms, and are streamlining the interview process to a coding test, site visit and lone interview, Mr Roussanov said. \"With hedge funds, the upside comes from the bonus,\" he said. \"The upside is much bigger than what they could potentially make at a tech firm, where it might be a small sign-on bonus and a cash bonus at the end of the year, plus an equity component.\" While money may not be the primary driver for a quant with five to 10 years' experience, right out of school it can make a huge difference, especially if the student has loans to pay back, the recruiter said. Richard Wu, a quantitative research analyst intern at Citadel, Ken Griffin's $30bn hedge fund, said he hadn't considered working in finance until he was a finalist at one of Citadel's data hackathons and the firm got in contact with him. Citadel launched what it calls its \"datathons\" in 2017 to help them target top quant, tech and data science graduates. Teams compete for a $25,000 cash prize, and are often approached by Citadel for internships or jobs. \"We all had the misconception that it'd be long hours, we would all have to go in at the same time, we'd all have to wear suits and that it'd be a strict dress code,\" Mr Wu said of his classmates at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where he is about to go into his senior year. His summer internship has been eye-opening. \"My team is flexible on when I come in and what I wear to work, as long as it's not a T-shirt and shorts,\" he said. \"As long as you get your work done, the hours are probably the same as tech. And in terms of the work we're doing, it's all technical. Both industries have their different focuses. In finance it's about increasing the bottom line. It's quantitatively more difficult and rigorous, in my opinion.\" The 21-year-old, who has also done internships at Google and Shopify, said that part of the challenge for him at Citadel is \"the game theory aspect; you're competing against a lot of people\". He has yet to decide what he would like to do once he graduates, whether to work in finance or technology, or go to grad school, but he said his priority will be to find where he can learn the most. \"After a certain point, compensation tapers off in its importance,\" he said. \"For me, the learning aspect outweighs the money.\" More from the Financial Times: Tech tumbles test conviction trades of hedge funds Dan Loeb's Third Point unveils PayPal stake Can factor investing kill off the hedge fund?

An \"enormous\" losing bet on bitcoin last week left one futures trader unable to cover the loss and other traders on a Hong Kong-based exchange to foot the bill. The gamble made on OKEx, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, was worth about $416 million, according to a company statement and the price of bitcoin futures Friday. Because of the sheer size of the order and bitcoin's price slump the exchange said it couldn't cover the loss. As a result, it implemented a clawback policy or what it called a \"societal risk management mechanism.\" Users with a net profit will have a portion of their earnings taken back to cover the difference between the liquidated price and the settled price. The trader, identified only as \"ID 2051247,\" initiated what the exchange called \"an unusually large long position order\" of more than 4 million contracts on July 31. The exchange said it immediately contacted the client and requested \"several times to partially close the positions to reduce the overall market risks.\" \"However, the client refused to cooperate, which lead to our decision of freezing the client's account to prevent further positions increasing,\" OKEx said on its website. \"Shortly after this preemptive action, unfortunately, the BTC price tumbled, causing the liquidation of the account.\" show chapters This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID 8:46 AM ET Sun, 13 May 2018 | 03:18 Although customers agreed to the clawback policy when they sign up for the exchange, the event threatens confidence in one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, and highlights the risks of trading there. \"That exchange shouldn't have let someone put that size of a position,\" said Brian Kelly, CEO and founder of BKCM. \"People could stop using that exchange, but even then, it doesn't have marketwide implications.\" Kelly said that while $416 million was the size of the position, the real amount customers will have to pay out is closer to $15 million.

Goldman Sachs is not optimistic for the near-term fate of cryptocurrency. In its mid-year economic report, the bank's investment management group highlighted \"cryptocurrency mania\" as one of six factors creating an unsteady undertow affecting markets for the remainder of 2018. \"We expect further declines in the future given our view that these cryptocurrencies do not fulfill any of the three traditional roles of a currency,\" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Goldman's chief investment officer of the private wealth management group, said in the report published Friday. The Wall Street giant reiterated its January call published in the full-year outlook that bitcoin's meteoric rise to $20,000 \"dwarfed\" mania seen during the dot-com bubble. The cryptocurrency has lost roughly 60 percent of its value since that high in December, and was trading near $7,470 Friday, according to industry site CoinDesk. show chapters The biggest bitcoin news of the year, says Brian Kelly 6:28 PM ET Fri, 3 Aug 2018 | 06:15 \"Our view that cryptocurrencies would not retain value in their current incarnation remains intact and, in fact, has been borne out much sooner than we expected.\" Mossavar-Rahmani said. Goldman is the latest global investment bank to take the view that cryptocurrency is neither a medium of exchange, \"nor a unit of measurement, nor a store of value.\" On Thursday, UBS made a similar assessment and said bitcoin is too \"unstable\" to be a mainstream currency. Mossavar-Rahmani reminded investors of cryptocurrencies' value compared to that of the total financial markets'. \"Such declines will not negatively impact the performance of financial assets because cryptocurrencies represent just 0.3 percent of world GDP as of mid-2018,\" she said. \"In fact, we believe that they garner far more traditional media and social media attention than is warranted.\" The investment bank is reportedly looking to launch a bitcoin trading desk this year and become the first Wall Street firm to make a market in cryptocurrencies. The bank's CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in June that while he doesn't own bitcoin, he wouldn't rule out the cryptocurrency having a future.

The conglomerate posted June quarter operating profits of $4,190 per Class A share, up 67 percent year over year and higher than the analyst consensus of $3,387 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. J.P. Morgan reiterated its overweight rating for Berkshire Hathaway shares, citing the company's strong performance across many of its businesses. \"Berkshire reported strong 2Q operating earnings that significantly exceeded our estimate and consensus, driven by better than expected earnings across nearly all segments, particularly insurance,\" analyst Sarah DeWitt said in a note to clients Monday. \"Earnings at Burlington Northern, Manufacturing, Service, Retail and Financial Products also exceeded our outlook while utility earnings were lower than we expected. Strong 2Q results at Berkshire reinforce our positive outlook.\" DeWitt reaffirmed her $235 price target for Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares, representing 17 percent upside to Friday's close. The Class B shares closed up 2.9 percent Monday after the results. The company's stock has underperformed the market this year. Its shares are up 1 percent for the year through Friday versus the S&P 500's 6.2 percent gain. Each share of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock.

Meanwhile, the U.S.-benchmark, the S&P 500, is nearing a fresh record. This would seemingly give President Donald Trump an upper hand as he engages in the trade fight. You can bet that if the U.S. stock market was suffering like China's market, the president would feel the pressure. But not so in Beijing. Analysts are telling their clients to prepare for a long \"bumpy\" ride in the escalating trade conflict. Safanad's chief investment officer, John Rutledge, argued that Chinese President Xi Jinping doesn't face much political pressure from his country's population. Earlier this year, China's parliament passed a constitutional amendment that removes presidential term limits, enabling Xi to stay in office indefinitely. \"Xi doesn't give a hoot about the poor people in China. Why do you think they attacked soybeans? Not just because of our farmers, but because he doesn't care about the pressure from his own people,\" he said Friday on CNBC. In similar fashion, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch predicted the trade war will take some time to be resolved. \"At this point, both sides seem to be digging for a long fight,\" Helen Qiao, an economist at BofAML said Friday. J.P. Morgan said the gulf between the two countries' trade requirements will mean longer, more protracted negotiations. \"The gap between U.S.'s demand list and China's offer list is very large, and the back-and-forth of the negotiations in recent months suggests that neither side would make major concessions,\" said Haibin Zhu, China equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. \"Given the huge gap between the two sides, the outlook remains extremely unclear. Negotiations, even if resumed, will likely involve a bumpy and lengthy process.\" On Monday, China's Shanghai composite fell 1.3 percent, extending its losing streak to four consecutive trading sessions. The index is down 18 percent so far this year compared with the S&P 500's 6 percent gain. The Asian country's benchmark is also down nearly 25 percent from its late January high. In similar fashion, the Dow Jones Shenzhen index is down about 26 percent year-to-date. Wells Fargo explained last month that Chinese stocks are falling this year because of the trade war, but also because of worries over China's economic growth. \"The broader picture is what could happen to the economies, the bigger economic impact, and if we did go down that path of rapid escalation, that could affect Chinese economic growth which is currently on a path toward slowing,\" Peter Donisanu, global market strategist at Wells, said on July 5. So far in the trade war between the two largest economic powers in the world, the U.S. has slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products, which China met with retaliatory duties. On Wednesday, Trump instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider raising proposed tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. In response, China said Friday that it is preparing to retaliate with tariffs on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. J.P. Morgan said China's stock market will not rebound until the trade war is resolved. \"U.S.-China trade tensions remain a big uncertainty and sentiment will likely remain cautious until there is further clarity on that front,\" J.P. Morgan's Zhu said in a note to clients Saturday. The firm predicts China's GDP growth rate will slow to 6.3 percent in the second half of 2018 versus 6.8 percent growth in the first half of the year. Over the weekend Trump said the U.S. was winning in its trade war with China, citing the dramatic outperformance of the domestic stock market versus the Asian country's market. Donald Trump tweet \"Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. China market has dropped 27% in last 4 months, and they are talking to us. Our market is stronger than ever, and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated. America First,\" Trump said Saturday on Twitter. It is not clear which Chinese index the president was citing for his 27 percent drop over the last four months.

The firm lowered its rating on the online real estate company's shares to neutral from buy, citing increasing concerns over its business model shift. Zillow shares plunged 16 percent Tuesday, a day after it reported second-quarter revenue of $325 million, just shy of consensus estimates of $326 million, according to Thomson Reuters. The company announced plans to acquire Mortgage Lenders of America, a national mortgage lender. The integration of that business poses a risk for 2019 results at a time when Zillow is already under pressure, analyst Nat Schindler said in a note to clients. \"The quarter revealed challenges for multiple business segments that limit our optimism on FY19 upside,\" he said. Schindler lowered his price target to $60 from $70 for Zillow shares, representing 2 percent upside to Monday's close. In April, Zillow announced a significant change to its business model, starting a capital-intensive business of buying and selling homes directly with consumers, expanding its offerings beyond its online real estate services. The Mortgage Lenders of America acquisition is intended to supplement that effort, the company said. Schindler said in his note that Zillow is taking longer to get the homes business off the ground, with its revenue outlook for this fiscal year around $30 million, down from previously expected $190 million. \"We think investors will wait for more clarity on the Homes and Mortgage businesses, now that management has sharply altered their trajectories.\" Zillow did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's stock is up 45 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 7 percent gain. \u2014 CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.

China's been fighting a trade war for the last 10 years; the U.S. has just realized that we haven't been fighting for the last decade. So we're starting to push back and China doesn't like it,\" Bass said Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"The Trump administration's lack of predictability is an asset to the U.S. in two areas, I think,\" he said. \"In our trade negotiations with China and in our, let's say, other negotiations with North Korea. I think that the fact that we only export about $100 billion or $130 billion worth of goods to China while we import almost $500 billion from China \u2013 we've got the leverage to really work through this tariff and trade war.\" Markets have scrutinized U.S.-China relations ever since the White House imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports earlier this year, which were met with retaliatory charges by Beijing. After President Donald Trump instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider raising proposed tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce responded with a retaliatory threat on $60 billion of U.S. goods last week. China's import taxes would range from 5 to 25 percent, the Ministry of Commerce said in a release on its website. There are four lists of goods, one for each of the rates proposed. Many of the goods are agricultural related, with others being various metals and chemicals. The possibility of an escalating trade war prompted market speculation that the Chinese government will use a weaker currency to fight the effect of tariffs and triggered complaints from Trump on the strength of the U.S. currency and the Federal Reserve's plans to raise U.S. interest rates. tweet But Bass also downplayed the currency fears, saying that the U.S. consumer isn't likely to see any major effect from the growing dispute. \"President Trump is kind of whining about devaluation of the Chinese currency and saying that that's \u2013 worrying that will bring higher prices and it doesn't,\" Bass added. \"All a devalued Chinese currency does is broaden the cost across the Chinese population. The dollar cost of goods to U.S. consumers stays the same. China has to either take the hit in price or in quantity; in the U.S., the dollar cost literally stays the same of anything that we put tariffs on in China. I think those pundits that argue to the contrary \u2014 there's no evidence to suggest that's true.\" China's currency has slid since mid-June after hovering around at higher levels from February through May. Since June 14, it has lost about 6.5 percent. The dollar strengthened to its highest level in more than one year against the yuan, also called the renminbi, on Friday to around $6.89. Bass is founder and managing partner of Hayman Capital Management. He is known for profiting and betting against subprime mortgages during the financial crisis in 2008. In February 2016, Bass said he devoted much of his fund to bet against the yuan, predicting it would depreciate by as much as 30 to 40 percent.

Butters said in a note that 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results through Friday have posted better-than-expected earnings. \"If 80% is the final number, it will mark the highest percentage since FactSet began tracking this metric in Q3 2008,\" he said in the note Friday. Much of the earnings outperformance comes from telecom, health-care and tech companies, Butters noted. All of the S&P 500 telecom companies have reported better-than-expected earnings this season, while 96 percent of health-care companies have outperformed earnings expectations. In tech, 93 percent of company earnings have exceeded forecasts. Through Friday, 81 percent of S&P 500 companies had released their latest quarterly reports. Some of the companies that have reported better-than-expected results include major banks J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America as well as tech giants like Amazon and Apple. 24% increase Investors came into this earnings season with high hopes as FactSet had forecast year-over-year profits to grow by 20 percent in the second quarter. So far, second-quarter earnings have increased by 24 percent through Friday. At this rate, quarterly earnings are on pace to post their second-highest year-over-year growth since the third quarter of 2010, when they grew by 34.1 percent, Butters said. \"It will also mark the third straight quarter in which the index has reported double-digit, earnings growth. All eleven sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in earnings. Ten sectors are reporting double digit earnings growth, led by the Energy, Materials, and Information Technology sectors,\" he said. For the remainder of the year, earnings are forecast to grow at a year-over-year rate of about 20 percent, but Butters said \"more moderate growth for early 2019\" is expected. Earnings are projected to grow by 7.3 percent in the first quarter of 2019 and by 8.2 percent in the second quarter of next year.

In June, Varadhan's former co-heads Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet departed \u2014 leaving at least one opening at the top of the business, which is typically led by two or more executives. The two trading co-heads will be charged with helping the firm \u2014 once Wall Street's most profitable trading house \u2014 regain some of its former glory. While Goldman traders produced about $33 billion in revenue in 2009, the firm has struggled to adjust to the post-financial crisis environment, and it produced only about a third of that amount last year. In the meantime, rivals including J.P. Morgan have gained market share, helped by a more diverse set of clients than Goldman. In other cases, competitors have revamped business by cutting traders, such as Morgan Stanley's move to cut one-fourth of its bond division in late 2015. Esposito has previously served as chief strategy officer of the securities division, and co-head of global fixed income sales. He joined Goldman in 1995 as a salesman for emerging markets debt. Esposito's promotion was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Since being formally named Blankfein's successor last month, Solomon has added three women to the firm's powerful management committee, and has proposed the company's first potential Investor Day to give the Street clear financial objectives. show chapters Goldman's new CEO David Solomon's likely deputies 2:38 PM ET Tue, 17 July 2018 | 01:24 "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/23/105025306-GettyImages-674517040.jpg?v=1533642830", "time": "2018-08-07T08:35:52-0400", "author": "Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images", "description": "Companies that discuss President Donald Trump \u2013 either positively or negatively \u2013 are far more likely to win backlash for their brands than find support from customers.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/07/advice-for-companies-thinking-about-discussing-donald-trump-dont.html", "title": "Study shows companies should avoid discussing Trump: 'Roughly 70% of the country will be upset or won't care'", "keywords": [{"term": " ", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Jim Watson", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Getty Images", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Donald Trump", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "the National Rifle Association", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Atlanta", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Georgia", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "April 28, 2017", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Donald Trump \u2013 either", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "56 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "just 32 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Clinton", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Morning Consult", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "just 30 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "32 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Trump,", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "roughly 70 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "CSR and Political Activism in the Trump Era", "category": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"term": "Morning Consult", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "two", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "America", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Morning Consult", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "America", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Republican", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Axios", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "first", "category": "ORDINAL"}, {"term": "Morning Consult", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "quarterly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the White House's", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Trump", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Eli Lilly", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "LLY", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "David Ricks", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "303", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "\u2014 Brian Goldner", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Hasbro Whirlpool (WHR", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "mid-May", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "U.S.", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Brazilian", "category": "NORP"}, {"term": "Russia", "category": "GPE"}, {"term": "Latin America", "category": "LOC"}, {"term": "the past few quarters", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Marc Bitzer", "category": "PERSON"}], "body": " Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump arrives to address the National Rifle Association (NRA) Leadership Forum in Atlanta, Georgia on April 28, 2017.

Criticizing the president leads 56 percent of Trump voters to have a much less favorable view of a company's brand while just 32 percent of Clinton voters to have a much more favorable view, according to Morning Consult, a market research company. The study found that just 30 percent of people will have a more favorable impression of a company if it issues a positive statement about Trump, while 32 percent will have a more favorable impression if it issues a negative statement. Thus, the researchers concluded that \"no matter what you say about Trump, roughly 70 percent of the country will be upset or won't care.\" \"For every person you're making happy, there are almost twice as many who are unhappy,\" the researchers wrote. \"What to do with Trump?

Facebook and Google's parent Alphabet will move out of the index's technology sector and to a newly formed communication services sector in about six weeks. The goal is to make tech appear less dominant in the S&P 500. DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas calls it the highest profile change to S&P's sector weightings in at least three decades and suggests there could be dangers. \"That will really reshape how people think about the weightings of tech in the S&P,\" he said Monday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"You're going to see a major downgrading of tech weightings in the S&P 500 when this change happens, and that's purely an illusion. That's just reclassifying the names and the sectors.\" The reshuffling begins on Sept. 21. But the ETF industry is already taking steps to reflect the change. It launched the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund, also known as the XLC, on June 19. The new ETF includes Facebook and Alphabet, which have been components of the Technology Select SPDR Fund or XLK. That will leave Apple, Microsoft, Visa and Intel as the top holdings in the technology sector ETF. \"If you own names like XLK and XLY [Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund], which are huge ETFs, the combined AUM [assets under management] is worth $45 billion. Realize you're no longer going to own Facebook and Google in XLK. Or Disney and Comcast or Netflix or Twitter inside of XLY,\" he said. \"So, if you like those names, buy them separately because they're no longer part of your holdings.\" With all the changes, Colas suggests investors to be vigilant when it comes to the new classifications. \"You'll see it's a lot more volatile than the old telecommunications sector, and that's really a warning sign to me. It's a very heavily concentrated group,\" Colas said. \"I'd say use extreme caution in looking at it, at least early on until you see how it trades. It's going to be very, very volatile out of the box.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBC Universal. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Who has promised Musk tens of billions of dollars to take his cash-burning company private? tweet Twenty-four hours after Musk's first tweet, Tesla has twice declined comment to CNBC on where the funding is coming from. The company and its board have issued statements on taking the company private, and both times, there was nothing said on financing. Wall Street bankers don't know, suggesting the money isn't being rounded up by a consortium of banks. What it could mean? Here are some ideas. 1. There is no funding This is the simplest Occam's Razor explanation. There simply is no funding. Maybe Musk just tweeted out something. Some Tesla board members said Musk approached them last week about going private. But even Musk, himself, simply tweeted he was \"considering\" it. That's not necessarily the language of someone with committed financing. There are no legal repercussions for saying \"funding secured,\" said Frank Aquila, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. \"It's sort of the same difference between collusion and conspiracy,\" Aquila said. \"Collusion isn't a crime. It means nothing in the legal sense. Conspiracy is a crime. If you say 'I secured this,' it could mean you had a conversation. Committed means something else. If you have committed financing, you have documentation and conditions. Secured just means lined up. It doesn't mean that much.\" The motivations for why Musk may have this are impossible to know without confirmation from Musk himself. Is it to spite shortsellers? Or maybe it is a warning to outside investors, like the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, to stop buying shares of his company? By the way, this wouldn't be the first time Musk has tweeted something that sounded definitive but wasn't. Last year, Musk tweeted that he had received \"verbal govt approval\" to build a high-speed hyperloop connecting New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Baltimore. It was later reported that the supposed approval was likely a miscommunication between Musk and a White House official. tweet 2. Musk feels confident he can get financing and has had conversations with individuals and funds It's possible Musk has had conversations with third parties about financing a transaction and feels comfortable he could round up cash. A full buyout would cost about $72 billion at $420 a share, though Musk, himself, owns 22 percent of the company and suggested he would allow existing shareholders to maintain ownership, which would lower the cost. Investors in a privatization could include sovereign wealth funds, wealthy individuals and private equity funds, though the latter may be unlikely given Tesla's business model isn't a good fit for standard leveraged buyout investment. Neither SoftBank nor the Vision Fund is involved in the financing, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank recently put $2.25 billion in GM's self-driving car unit Cruise. Chinese funds have billions to spend, but CFIUS and other regulatory concerns could doom a large buyout of a U.S.-based company with strong ties to technology. \"Can he get the financing? I suspect he can,\" Aquila said. \"There's an awful lot of cash trying to find a home right now.\" Still, it's unlikely Tesla could raise the money through debt markets, according to people familiar with the matter. Tesla raised high-yield debt a year ago, and it's already trading at 92 cents on the dollar. Banks may be unlikely to take the risk on raising $30 billion to $60 billion on a car company that doesn't pump out cash and could be at risk if there's an macroeconomic downturn. 3. Musk has the money and, for some reason, the company hasn't said where it's coming from This seems the least likely at this point, but perhaps there's a reason Tesla hasn't disclosed where the money is coming from. The company isn't under an obligation to disclose the funding information. Maybe Tesla just wants to keep everyone guessing. Or maybe Tesla is frantically trying to turn the investors referenced in Reason No. 2 into fully committed investors in preparation for a public statement. show chapters Elon Musk is a 'train wreck' as a public company CEO: Volvo board member 11:24 AM ET Wed, 8 Aug 2018 | 08:02 - Additional reporting by CNBC's Hugh Son, Robert Ferris and Lora Kolodny.

Among those who don't get the name and think there are better corporate options include former Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman. \"I have a hard time getting my arms around that name. Sorry,\" Goldman said on CNBC's Squawk Box Tuesday morning. But Goldman backs an idea Verizon management has been resisting: eliminating its new brand-name problem by spinning off AOL and Yahoo as a separate publicly traded company, while retaining an 80 percent ownership stake. \"I could tell you what I would do if I were in their shoes. ... I would offload 20 percent,\" Goldman said. The former Yahoo CFO said motivating employees at the acquired companies would be a driver for the deal. \"Now you have a public company. You can give stock to those employees, so you can motivate those employees,\" he said. \"Let me put it into perspective. You're an employee at Yahoo. You've been running this independent company for 20 years.\" Getty Images Goldman said spinning off the media assets wouldn't impede Verizon's ability to use them strategically. \"You can get the best of all worlds. ... You can work the distribution. If you want to put some of those sites directly on your phone, they can do that.\" It does not seem likely that Goldman's opinion will sway Verizon management. It has been clear that a spinoff is not in the works. A Verizon spokeswoman referred questions to its most recent earnings conference call, when chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam said, \"The questions around Oath \u2014 I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format. We see the synergies that we expected to see, and we see the future that we had hoped for. ... The integration efforts that are going on, they are on schedule, and so we see no reason to do that, and there's no credible report out there that are otherwise in my view. So I'd be clear about that.\" Tech 'has never been as on fire' The former Yahoo CFO thinks it is a very good time for initial public offerings in the technology sector. There has been a recent string of successful tech IPOs, showing that public valuations are again more competitive versus private valuations. He said there are a number of very large companies that are primed to go public by 2019. \"Valuations for the first time in a long while are higher than their private valuations. So both the investors and the company and management can see the way when they go public now,\" Goldman said. Goldman is on the board of directors at cloud-based subscription management company Zuora, which went public at $14 a share in April and has doubled to near $28. \"I think technology, in particular in the Valley, has never been as on fire,\" Goldman said. \"You have mobility, you have AI, you have machine learning, the Internet of Things.

According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, corporate buybacks appear poised to reach the $1 trillion mark this year. \"There's a riddle in play here,\" said Blank, chief equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research. \"This is the good news that is bad news.\" In fact, the last time there was a big surge in buybacks was in 2007, he pointed out.

At the same time, the hurdles become higher for internal capital investment allocations that can add more to a record profit margin, he explained. Therefore, the default is more share buybacks, he said. However, he stressed that whether this is a peak earnings year is impossible to know in advance, only in hindsight. He said he thinks the forward-looking calculus is tough to ignore. \"It is better to accept it. Stocks can advance for a few more months, and then roll over, foretelling the peak that is just over the horizon,\" he said. Meanwhile, Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs and co-host of \"Shark Tank,\" thinks companies just shouldn't do buybacks. \"I hate buybacks,\" he said on \"Closing Bell.\" For one, companies are bad at timing \u2014 right now they would be buying them at the highs, he said. Plus, \"I like to put my money to work where I want to. I don't necessarily want to take my portions of the profits of XYZ Corp. and have the management decide that I should buy more shares,\" O'Leary added.

The government argues Judge Leon ignored \"mainstream economics\" in his decision because he refused to see a deal as having \"an appreciable danger\" of raising prices on consumers in the future. The government said Judge Leon ignored economic theory by claiming Time Warner wouldn't have increased bargaining power over pay-TV distributors by linking up with AT&T. This was one of the DOJ's primary arguments during the initial case to the District Court -- that AT&T could charge companies such as Comcast, Charter and Dish more money for Time Warner with the fallback of blacking out networks such as CNN, TNT and TBS and offering them on DirecTV, which AT&T owns. If pay-TV operators refused to pay more, customers could switch their service to DirecTV, setting up a \"win-win\" for AT&T. AT&T successfully defended against this charge, arguing that the economics behind buying Time Warner only made sense if the company made programming available to as many people as possible. show chapters DOJ: Judge ignored economics, common sense in AT&T-Time Warner Deal 4:42 PM ET Mon, 6 Aug 2018 | 02:24 \"The district court's determination that Time Warner would not have increased bargaining leverage post-merger erroneously disregarded the economics that governs negotiations in this industry,\" the DOJ argued in its brief. \"Defendants' FCC filings acknowledged that the vertical integration of a high-value programmer with a large distributor in the MVPD industry leads to higher fees for rival distributors.\" The DOJ also argued Judge Leon accepted an argument that DirecTV customers will receive lower prices because Time Warner wouldn't raise prices as aggressively to its own corporate parent because the firm, as a whole, would want to maximize corporate profits. The government said Judge Leon dismissed this argument as \"implausible\" when used in a different context pertaining to rival pay-TV firms. Further, the government said Judge Leon dismissed the concerns of rivals because they are competitors of DirecTV rather than taking them on face value. The district court \"gave no consideration to the fact that these distributors had a direct and immediate stake as customers in the negotiations with Time Warner,\" the government argued. AT&T General Counsel David McAtee responded by criticizing the appeal as a desperate plea to re-do Judge Leon's decision. \"Appeals aren't 'do-overs,\" McAtee said in a statement. \"After a long trial, Judge Leon weighed the evidence and rendered a comprehensive 172-page decision that systematically exposed each of the many holes in the Government's case.

When fear and loathing is at its greatest, then it's time to buy, or so the theory goes. Negative sentiment has been abundant around emerging market (EM) assets over the last four months. Investors who flooded into riskier higher growth plays to chase higher returns in a low volatility, low interest rate world, fled the market darling in the face of a stronger dollar, hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and trade tensions. But is the worst almost over? The fund outflows from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) last week offered a glimmer of hope, and contrarians think we've hit maximum selling. Julian Howard, head of multi-asset solutions at GAM, forecast a massive opportunity in emerging markets during a recent appearance on CNBC. \"We may be at the peak of the anti-EM trade, we've had a very strong dollar, rising interest rates, but that's almost getting priced,\" he said. \"The strong dollar is reflecting that the U.S. economy is doing well, we know the U.S. economy is not going to beat 4.1 percent in 2019. It's almost as though we can see the top of the hill, and that should bring relief to emerging markets.\" Howard also reminded investors of the rationale for buying emerging markets \u2014 future growth is going to come from China and Asia. \"You don't even need to get that cute about it, emerging markets as a whole is trading at a 30 percent discount to the MSCI World index. So it's a matter of being in it to capture the upside and if we are peak dollar, and there are strong arguments for that, then emerging markets should start to pay off,\" he said. Emerging market specialists are also sympathetic to the idea that the EM storm is abating. Louis Costa, head of CEEMEA FX and rates strategy at Citi, told CNBC that emerging market funds have built up cash balances, but that perhaps most of the outflows have now happened. He also pointed out that much of the selling was in liquid instruments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and that he would be more concerned if the selling had been at an institutional level. But Costa cautioned investors to remain selective. \"The policy of buy everything that walks has gone\", he said. Others are nursing EM wounds and warn a return is premature. \"We have been long and wrong in emerging markets this year, although we are not changing our allocation,\" said Richard Champion, deputy chief investment officer at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management. \"Let's get the midterms out of the way to see if the trade talk is just politicking.\" Study the EM tide closely if you've looking to catch the wave.

The Turkish lira and benchmark sovereign bond hit a record low as the threat of U.S. sanctions added pressure to already ailing markets. The U.S. dollar rose to 5.4 against the lira on Monday before trading around 5.29 on Tuesday. Turkey's 10-year bond fell to a record low on Tuesday, pushing its yield up to around 20 percent before hovering around 18.8 percent. Bond prices move inversely to yields. Turkish capital markets have struggled this year as the country deals with a weakening economy. The sharp moves down come after President Donald Trump threatened last month to slap \"large sanctions\" on the Middle Eastern nation if it refuses to free Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor. The U.S. then announced on Aug. 1 sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers, prohibiting U.S. citizens from doing business with them. \"This is a shot across the bow,\" said Marcus Chenevix, an analyst at TS Lombard. \"Now, I think the U.S. will give them time to respond. It's not like the U.S. sees this as a pressing political matter, it just can't seem to be backing down to these hostage tactics.\" Turkey detained Brunson in October 2016, accusing him of spying and trying to overthrow the government after a failed coup earlier that year. Trump demanded in a July 26 tweet the Turkish government release Brunson. Tweet A Turkish delegation is headed to Washington to discuss the conflict between the two countries, according to multiple reports. TS Lombard's Chenevix said that an ideal response to the U.S. sanctions threat would be for the Turkish to release Brunson, as the situation adds even more uncertainty to its already weakened capital markets. For the year, the lira is down nearly 40 percent against the U.S. dollar. Turkish stocks have also taken a beating in 2018. The iShares MSCI Turkey exchange-traded fund (TUR) is down 39 percent year to date. Turkey's stocks also missed out on the broad rally in emerging markets last month, falling 6.7 percent in July while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) rose 3.5 percent. \"There's an underlying trend and a short-term trigger here,\" said Chenevix. \"The short-term trigger is the threat of sanctions. The underlying trend is the Turkish economy is in an overheating crisis.\" \"Given the high, volatile inflation of the overheating crisis, Turkish monetary-policy makers are always playing catch-up,\" he added. \"The Turkish economy is headed for a hard landing.

Nearly 400 Wells Fargo customers lost their homes when they were accidentally foreclosed on after a software glitch denied them the ability to modify their mortgages as they sought federal aid, the bank disclosed in a regulatory filing late Friday. The bank apologized and has set aside $8 million to compensate those affected by the glitch, which occurred from 2010 to 2015. \"During the course of an internal review, we determined that an automated calculation error may have affected the decision on whether or not to offer or approve some mortgage modifications between April 13, 2010 and Oct. 20, 2015, when the error was corrected,\" Tom Goyda, senior vice president of Wells Fargo said in a statement to the Business Times. \"We're very sorry that this error occurred and are providing remediation to the approximately 625 customers who may have been impacted.\" Wells Fargo said the software mistake miscalculated customers' eligibility for mortgage modifications. The error caused about 625 customers to be denied loan modifications they sought from a federal program to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. While those amounts may seem small, considering Wells originated nearly $95 billion in mortgages in 2017 and is the largest mortgage servicer in the U.S., Wells is still grappling with public trust issues since September 2016, when it revealed a settlement with banking regulators over creating 3.5 million phantom accounts without customers' knowledge, in order to meet company sales targets. The bank agreed to pay $185 million in penalties and $5 million to customers in that case and then fired 5,300 people over the scandal, including the ouster of its CEO and several top executives in consumer banking. But then the cavalcade of scandals didn't stop there. Just last week, in a separate settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Wells Fargo, the second-largest mortgage agreed to pay a $2.1 billion fine for issuing loans it knew were based on false income information. Wells Fargo is operating under a Federal Reserve cap on asset growth, placed by former Fed Chairman Janet Yellen before she left office in February. The Fed ordered Wells to fix control and compliance problems involving misleading sales practices in consumer banking. Separately, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating its wealth management division. The bank said it paid $114 million to refund wealth management customers who had been overcharged in the last seven years, and $171 million for foreign-exchange clients.

According to Ned Davis Research's Ed Clissold, there's a high probability a record year-end rally will give way to a painful 2019. \"You could be looking at the first 20 percent-plus decline in the S&P since the financial crisis,\" the firm's chief U.S. strategist said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" His worst-case scenario is a 30 percent plunge next year. \"Our primary list of concerns is on the earnings front,\" Clissold said. \"Earnings growth north of 20 percent isn't sustainable, especially when you're nine years into an economic expansion.\" Clissold, a secular bull, isn't calling for a major, drawn-out recession. Nevertheless, he said he's on bear market watch due to warning signs indicating a tired bull market. \"We're certainly a lot further along than we were a couple of years ago certainly in the economic cycle,\" Clissold said. \"From a technical standpoint, leadership has certainly gone from being more aggressive to more defensive. ... More defensive sectors like health care, utilities, staples and telecom have been leading as of late.\" Despite his cautiousness, Clissold hasn't officially downgraded his positive outlook on U.S. stocks. His S&P 500 year-end price target is 2,900 \u2014 about a 1.5 percent gain from current levels. He said stocks could soon see a short-lived pullback mainly do to seasonal trends at any time, and then grab gains as the year winds down. \"From [the] 2009 lows, whenever we got a pause, we'd break out of what we'd call a breadth thrust. You'd get a huge percentage of stocks moving up together, and that's a sign of a very healthy market,\" Clissold said. \"We haven't gotten one since the February correction, and that's a change in character. It doesn't mean the market can't rally for a while. But, that's what happens at the end of a bull market, not at a beginning for a bull market.\" Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Still, they predicted that investors will likely face lower returns ahead. Rainer Michael Preiss, executive director at Taurus Wealth Advisors in Singapore, pointed to how the environment is changing: volatility is picking up, and interest rates are rising and central banks are tightening. Market volatility has been stoked by U.S.-China trade tensions, and the two major stock indexes in China have already lost one-quarter of their value from highs earlier this year. \"So far, everybody has been conditioned to buy the dip. In all honesty, that was the right strategy for the last couple of years when we had quantitative easing. Now interest rates are rising, and we have so-called quantitative tightening,\" Preiss said. Quantitative easing, which involves pumping money into the system, contributed to rising prices for stocks and bonds. Conversely, central banks' reversing that process \u2014 known as quantitative tightening \u2014 decreases liquidity in the market, weighing on prices in the process. Preiss, who spoke to CNBC on Monday, said that tightening will likely lead to lower returns for stock market investors. \"The returns are becoming less and risks are rising ... The risk is rising with regards to the returns you potentially get from long-only equities,\" he said, referring to the common investment strategy of solely buying shares that are expected to increase in value. Deutsche Bank Wealth Management said in a Aug. 7 report that central banks' attempt to normalize their monetary policy is likely to lead to \"positive but rather lower returns in conventional asset classes (such as equities or corporate bonds) than the high levels investors have grown used to in the last few years.\" \"At the same time, a period of abnormally low market volatility appears to be coming to an end,\" the report added. A change of investing strategies In times of volatility, a more hands-on approach to investing often leads to better returns, experts said. A so-called active investing strategy for stocks can outperform the overall market by taking advantage of short-term price fluctuations, they said. Passive investors, on the other hand, are in it for the long term, and limit the amount of buying and selling within their portfolios. They usually invest in assets that mirror the composition of major stock or bond indices. \"I think in this environment, it would be prudent to raise cash, but also secondly, try to reduce passive investment strategies, (exchange-traded funds), and also go into investments that are active, where you have some ability to also raise cash, also have the ability to look into non-index stocks,\" Preiss said. He added: \"Our portfolio construction has shifted into more flexible mandates, unconstrained strategies that potentially can benefit from higher volatility. Because I think whatever everyone seems to agree upon is that ... volatility is rising.\" Hedge funds, for instance, might be a good alternative in this environment because they tend to experience less volatile returns, suggested Deutsche Bank Wealth Management.

Our screen for potential airline acquisitions by BRK suggests LUV would be a good strategic fit,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Kai Pan and Rajeev Lalwani said in a joint note entitled \"Should BRK Show More LUV?\" Tuesday. \"We have no knowledge of any M&A discussions and the airlines have not commented. That said, our screen of potential airline acquisitions by Berkshire suggests Southwest could fit well into Berkshire's family given its acquisition criteria, ownership of capital-intensive businesses, and deployable $100b+ cash balance.\" Southwest shares closed up 1.3 percent Wednesday after the report. The analysts cited Buffett's acquisition criteria of large size, \"consistent earnings power,\" not much debt, good current management, \"simple\" business model and attractive price. \"Berkshire focuses on quality of business and management in acquisition, which could make for an obvious pairing [with Southwest],\" they said. \"While we recognize that other factors could come under consideration, our screen suggests Southwest as a hypothetical candidate for a more permanent relationship with Berkshire.\" Berkshire Hathaway already has a large stake of around $2.8 billion in Southwest Airlines, according to FactSet using the latest March 13F filing holdings data. Buffett's company also owns positions in Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Continental. The analysts noted Southwest is similar to Berkshire's insurance company GEICO as an industry leader with \"significant competitive advantage\" and low cost structure. They said Berkshire could bid $70 to $80 per share for Southwest, citing historical market premiums the company has paid for its acquisitions. The midpoint of that price range represents 29 percent upside to Tuesday's stock price close. Morgan Stanley currently has an overweight rating and $67 price target for Southwest shares. Southwest Airlines declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla shares surged 11 percent Tuesday after a tweet from Musk's verified Twitter account that mentioned taking the company private at a $420 per share price. The tweet came after an earlier report from the Financial Times that said Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund bought a 3 to 5 percent stake in the electric car maker, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. That report had already partly lifted Tesla's stock. show chapters Tesla short sellers are shorting the game of being public: Former TrueCar CEO 10:48 AM ET Wed, 8 Aug 2018 | 08:13 Musk later explained in an email to company employees why he is considering taking Tesla private but also said \"a final decision has not yet been made.\" The email was published on Tesla's corporate blog. Tesla's closing price of $379.57 a share on Tuesday is 5.5 percent above the $359.87 conversion price for the company's $920 million convertible debt due in March, according to a securities filing. On or after Dec. 1, 2018, to the debt's maturity date, the holders can decide to convert the debt into Tesla shares. If Tesla's stock is above the $359.87 stock price, the holders will likely convert the debt into equity, relieving the company from using $920 million in cash required when the debt comes due in March. There is no evidence this was Musk's intention with his remarks on Tuesday. Tesla's stock would need to stay above the convert's conversion price level into December for the financial pressure to be eased. In March, Moody's specifically cited the March 2019 $920 million convertible and the company's cash burn rate as reasons for its downgrade of Tesla's credit rating. Tesla's skeptics have called into question the state of the company's financial position. It lost nearly $2 billion last year, and so far this year it burned through about $1.8 billion in cash after capital investments through two quarters. The company had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the June quarter. Last week, Tesla said in its second-quarter update it will generate positive profits and cash flow going forward absent a severe economic downturn. The company expects its cash balance to grow in the third and fourth quarters. Telsa also guided to GAAP profitability in both quarters. Several members of Tesla's board said in a statement Wednesday the board has met \"several times\" over the last week to discuss Musk's plan to take the company private.

The Chinese currency is expected to hit 6.7 yuan per U.S. dollar by the end of the year, the bank said. That's around 2 percent stronger from Wednesday's close and would represent a 2.98 percent decline for the whole year. \"Currently the market is very much driven by negative sentiment induced by concerns about trade tensions ... We think that the market is currently projecting a pretty pessimistic scenario,\" Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory for Asia at HSBC Private Bank, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. HSBC is not the only bank that has said investors may have overreacted in selling down Chinese shares and currency. But its view on the yuan contrasts with many analysts including those from J.P. Morgan, UBS and ING, which said the currency's outlook remains uncertain given escalating trade tensions with the U.S. and China's own economic challenges. ING, for one, said it expects the Chinese currency to weaken to 7 yuan per U.S. dollar by year-end \u2014 a level not seen in more than 10 years. In a bid to stabilize the yuan, the People's Bank of China last week imposed a new rule asking banks to set aside reserves equivalent to 20 percent of their sales, making it more expensive for investors to bet that the currency would weaken. Fan said the PBOC's move will help to lift sentiment. Worries about capital outflows have also not materialized because foreign investors are still buying Chinese shares and bonds, Fan said. \"Of course we'll need to take into account potential downside risks of further deterioration in the trade tensions,\" she said, adding that the escalation in the trade conflict with the U.S. actually gives China greater incentive to stimulate domestic demand for growth. \"Given that domestic demand contributes more than 90 percent of China's GDP growth, domestic demand growth would hold key to financial and economic stability in the second half of the year,\" she added. Even if U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are implemented, that's likely to shave just 0.4 percentage point off China's economic growth, Fan said. Watch: J.P.

Funding secured,\" the CEO wrote in his original post, adding in subsequent tweets that shareholders could either opt to sell at $420 per share or hold their stake and go private. In an email to employees later Tuesday, Musk explained that, as a public company, Tesla shares are subject to \"wild swings\" in price that prove to be a \"major distraction\" and that Wall Street's quarter-to-quarter expectations may not necessarily be a good fit for the company. \"This is out there, even for Tesla,\" a Barclays note said. \"Buyout would require about $70 billion: roughly $60 billion for equity and about $10 billion to take out debt. With 145 million shares, a buyout at $420/share would require $60 billion to take out all public shareholders. Even with the Saudi fund taking a 3 percent to 5 percent stake, that leaves a large funding gap. And credit markets may not be that receptive.\" Here's a wrap of all the major analyst opinions going out to Wall Street analysts regarding Musk's musings on privatization. J.P. Morgan Chase (underweight): \"As surprising to us as these developments are, and as lacking as the statements are in any details regarding who is expected to provide the required amount of financing and on what terms, they are nevertheless declarative statements from the CEO of a public company which we feel should be considered seriously. Either funding is secured or it is not secured, and Tesla's CEO says funding is secured. Therefore, we are incorporating into our valuation the real possibility the equity will be taken out at $420 per share. Separate from the Twitter statements, the company also made public a letter Mr. Musk had written to Tesla employees in which he states, 'If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us.' To us, this suggests more than mere consideration \u2014 Mr. Musk expects Tesla will go private.\"\"We continue to believe Tesla's valuation based on fundamentals alone is worth no more than $195 (our previous price target). But introducing a new 50 percent weighting of $420 suggests a large upward revision to our price target is warranted, and we newly value Tesla at $308 per share.\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (underperform): \"Although Tesla did confirm a potential privatization through Musk's statement, no theoretical transaction method, funding plan, or structure was outlined, and there is still some skepticism over whether such a transaction would ultimately be executed. Ultimately, we view today's announcement as having substance given what appears to be at least three potential sources of capital. Further credence was added with potential details in Musk's subsequent tweets regarding the setup of 'special purpose fund' for existing investors to remain involved, commentary that no single shareholder would have control, and that he would remain on as CEO. Despite a new factor being thrown into the mix on Tesla's stock, namely a potential unsubstantiated Elon-led buyout, privatization of the company is still very much unclear at this point; and therefore, we maintain our underperform rating.\" Morgan Stanley (equal weight): \"We sympathize with Elon Musk's argument that Tesla could be better off as a private company. The scale and scope of launching an auto company while providing a focused internal narrative to employees and stakeholders on the goals of the enterprise may be better aligned outside of the eye of the public market with a longer-term horizon. Tesla has long relied on public markets to fund its ambitious plan and has used its highly priced equity and equity-linked currency to its advantage since 2010. Taking the company private would assume one of 2 factors changing: (1) that the company is on the verge of generating self-sustaining cash flows or (2) that the company can tap into a range of strategic sources of capital not previously at its disposal.\"\"If Tesla's CEO really wanted to go private\u2026 why announce it to the world in this way\u2026 which could significantly contribute to the required premium and financial leverage? For much of the past few months, Tesla's CEO has made statements directly engaging investors and at many times making supportive statements to the share price. Investors might reasonably ask why Tesla management would want the stock price to reflect all the premium of an LBO up-front. It is hard to understand the potential reason for such a negotiating strategy.\" Goldman Sachs (sell): \"We do see some potential issues transitioning the current shareholder base to this type of private structure as there may not be enough liquidity for large institutions within the current fund ownerships (i.e., funds managing investments in publicly traded stocks vs. potential private transaction arms of the business). We believe this would require some degree of internal shifting of the investment responsibility, where different return metrics, AUM sizes, and investment strategies could be under consideration. While we take no view on the potential conversion rate of public to private shareholders, we note that incremental equity or leverage could potentially be needed to help finance an MBO.\" UBS (sell): \"Earlier today, CEO Musk tweeted that he is 'considering' taking Tesla private at $420/share and noted funding was secured. Following his tweet, an email sent to employees was shared publicly outlining the motivation including noting that volatile stock prices are distracting to Tesla employees. We find the timing of the tweet (& the method itself) interesting given less than a week ago the company said it would be profitable with positive cash flow in Q3/Q4. In our view, this may be another way for Musk to change the conversation around the company; however, we note that the fundamentals have in no way changed.\" RBC (sector perform): \"We mostly agree with Elon's sentiment that being public puts more focus on short term quarterly metrics and can distract from the long-term mission. He held up SpaceX, which does seem to operate more smoothly, as a prime example. However, being private could hamper raising new equity if ever needed. Now if we are correct in the above on outside funding, Elon may believe that gives him the cushion he needs to get him through Model 3 ramp and China Gigafactory build out as well as coming debt obligations. Should this deal occur, we believe that remaining in is a vote of confidence in Elon and represents an avenue for those that want to invest with Elon. However, liquidity is hampered (2 trading periods a year) and what type of disclosure would be provided is unclear.\" Barclays (underweight/neutral): \"This is out there, even for Tesla ... Buyout would require about $70 billion: roughly $60 billion for equity and about $10 billion to take out debt. With 145 million shares, a buyout at $420/share would require $60 billion to take out all public shareholders. Even with the Saudi fund taking a 3 percent to 5 percent stake, that leaves a large funding gap. And credit markets may not be that receptive. The Tesla unsecured bonds trade at a yield of about 6.7 percent, so even if say $40 billion could be financed in the high yield market, the annual interest bill would consume $2.7 billion in cash. And not clear how public shareholders stay in a private company. Musk promised that existing shareholders 'can stay investors in a private Tesla' \u2013 but we're not clear how that would work under current registration rules/caps on non-accredited and total investors \u2013 although Musk hinted at a special purpose vehicle structure that might be able to avoid the caps.\" Evercore (in-line): \"It is important to note that, as of today, no details have been provided with regards to what 'Funding secured' means, who is providing that funding and what any potential funding structure might look like. Our view is that 'Funding secured' should be interpreted as a strong verbal commitment, with funds available and parties willing to execute quickly. However, it could be less than this. It may also be that initial legal documents, term sheets, letters of intent have been signed. While several press reports suggest an 'LBO,' given Tesla's EBITDA and cash generation today, we don't see material leverage as likely. Instead, we see a possible scenario where 50 percent to 60 percent of existing shareholders (including Musk's 20 percent holding) continue, with their holdings rolled into a new private structure.\" Jefferies (hold): \"True to his unconventional and questionable communication style, Elon Musk tweeted 'Considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured'. No further details or confirmation. The rationale for being private is well known (see email to employees on website). There is no intention to merge with SpaceX. $420/share would value Tesla at $71 billion, 2.3x 2019E revenue. Subject to a shareholder vote and to conditions offered in terms of liquidity, exit and potential remuneration the overall cash cost could be more modest considering c.20 percent insiders and c.30 percent long term holders. As Tesla can hardly take on more debt, providers of funds could become new large shareholders. Also, despite repeated complaints, Tesla has hugely benefited from supportive public markets and from abnormally low cost of capital which may not be sustained privately.\" "}, {"urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/10/17/104778357-GettyImages-526929836-goldiocks.jpg?v=1533755809", "time": "2018-08-08T17:02:41-0400", "author": "Michael Nicholson | Corbis | Getty Images", "description": "This is an environment that feels like 'if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,' says GuideStone Capital Management's David Spika.\u00a0", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/goldilocks-economy-not-sustainable-time-to-reduce-risk-david-spika.html", "title": "'Goldilocks' economy not sustainable, investors should start reducing risk: Money manager", "keywords": [{"term": "5:15 PM ET", "category": "TIME"}, {"term": "8", "category": "CARDINAL"}, {"term": "David Spika", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "CNBC", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Wednesday", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Spika", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "GuideStone Capital Management", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "more than $11 billion", "category": "MONEY"}, {"term": "4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "20 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "4 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "Goldilocks", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Power Lunch", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "today", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Spika", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Goldilocks", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Twitter", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Facebook", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "second-quarter", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "late July", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "the worst day", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "2014", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "monthly", "category": "DATE"}, {"term": "Netflix", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "David Sowerby's", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Power Lunch", "category": "PRODUCT"}, {"term": "Goldilocks", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Sowerby", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ancora Advisers", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "better than 10 percent", "category": "PERCENT"}, {"term": "DSW", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Kearny Financial", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "Sowerby", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "Ancora", "category": "PERSON"}, {"term": "DSW", "category": "ORG"}, {"term": "KRNY", "category": "FAC"}], "body": " show chapters Are we in a Goldilocks economy? Analysts debate 5:15 PM ET Wed, 8 Aug 2018 | 03:27 While there's a good chance the market will continue to run higher, it's time for investors to start turning a bit cautious, money manager David Spika told CNBC on Wednesday. \"A phrase that is ringing through my head is 'if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.' And that's what this environment feels like today,\" said Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management, which has more than $11 billion in assets under management. He points to 4 percent GDP growth, 20 percent earnings growth, unemployment below 4 percent and wages \"not growing like they should.\" \"All of this is a Goldilocks scenario that is just not sustainable,\" he told \"Power Lunch.\" Goldilocks generally refers to an economy that is not too hot or cold such as having moderate growth and low inflation. While second-quarter earnings growth has been driving the market today, Spika's concerned that investors are expecting this current Goldilocks environment to continue. \"We saw what happens when companies fail to meet earnings expectations, with Twitter and Facebook and Netflix,\" he said. \"Markets are not going to react favorably if these high expectations are not met.\" Facebook, which posted second-quarter earnings in late July, suffered the worst day in its history as a public company after reporting revenue that missed analyst projections. Twitter shares, meanwhile, experienced their worst single-day percentage drop since 2014 after reporting declining monthly active users. Netflix shares also tumbled after it missed its subscriber addition projections. Spika recommends that investors start to look at lower-risk assets. \"Can the market continue to go up from here? Probably. Will it? Yeah, there's a good chance it will,\" he said. \"But at this point in the cycle, as late as we are, as much as we've made in the markets \u2013 particularly in technology \u2013 I think it's time to start de-risking,\" he said. However, that's not what's on portfolio manager David Sowerby's agenda. He told \"Power Lunch\" he would do \"very little\" de-risking. \"If we were at Goldilocks levels, investor sentiment would be much more euphoric and robust. It is simply not. That's a good thing. That can allow asset prices to go higher,\" said Sowerby, a managing director at Ancora Advisers. While there is risk on some of the \"priced-to-perfection\" tech stocks, he said there are large- and small-cap stocks that are growing dividends better than 10 percent and have a healthy free-cash flow. Specifically, he still sees great valuations in names like DSW and Kearny Financial. \"I don't think that's an overpriced, over excessive market that you want to be significantly de-risking,\" Sowerby said. Disclosures: Ancora owns DSW and KRNY.

The media outlet said the Saudi's Public Investment Fund bought a 3 percent to 5 percent stake in the electric car maker, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The stake is worth $1.9 billion to $3.2 billion at the company's current share price. The Saudi fund approached CEO Elon Musk about buying newly issued shares, the report said, but Tesla declined. Instead the Public Investment Fund bought the shares in secondary markets. Reuters later confirmed the Saudi fund bought a stake \"at just below 5 percent\" of the company, according to a source familiar with the matter. Tesla shares later jumped further after a tweet from Musk's verified Twitter account, which mentioned taking the company private. The company's short sellers lost about $1.3 billion in mark-to-market losses Tuesday, according to estimates from S3's head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky. Musk said on Tesla's second-quarter earnings call the company has no plans to raise capital. \"We will not be raising any equity at any point,\" he said. \"We certainly could raise money, but I think we don't need to and we \u2014 yeah, I think, it's better to \u2014 it is better discipline not to.\" One analyst took solace in Tesla's statement on the call that the company does not plan or need to raise more capital. \"Tesla reiterated earnings and positive cash flow guidance, and the company has no plans to raise equity capital,\" Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note to clients. \"A major step function up in Q3 revenue will strongly counter the popular narrative around bankruptcy risk, thus reducing an estimated $12 billion in short interest and driving shares higher.\" The stock was halted at $367.25 per share shortly after 2 p.m. Musk later explained in an email to company employees why he is considering taking Tesla private, but also said \"a final decision has not yet been made.\" The email was published on Tesla's corporate blog. Telsa shares resumed trading at 3:45pm and closed up 11 percent Tuesday. The company declined to comment.

While Farley said the word \"secured\" may mean Musk has some people who are interested, he takes issue with a later tweet that says, \"Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote.\" Musk shareholder vote tweet \"He's saying the funding is not only secured, it's certain,\" Farley said. \"That's a bit outlandish.\" \"As a former regulator, the first thing I would have done is said 'Geez, are they running afoul of any rules here?' And I'm certain SEC is asking the same question,\" he added. Farley said if he was still the head of the NYSE and Tesla was listed on his exchange, \"I would have picked up the phone to our head of regulatory \u2026 and said, 'Hey this looks odd to me, I just want to make sure you are aware of it.' Immediately. I would have done that immediately.\" Trading in Tesla shares was halted on Tuesday after the tweets. Farley said the Nasdaq likely called Tesla to tell the company to release more information. Once that happened, there was a \"smooth, steady\" reopening of the stock, he pointed out. However, \"that should have happened before this tweet in the middle of the day,\" he said. \"There are retail investors here that you have to worry about.\" According to Dow Jones, the Securities and Exchange Commission has made inquiries to Tesla over the tweets. Musk has provided no details on the source of the funding. At $420 a share, a full buyout would cost about $72 billion. However, Musk owns 22 percent of the company and he has suggested he would allow existing shareholders to maintain ownership, which would lower the cost. Tesla has twice declined to comment on where the funding is coming from and did not immediately return a request for comment on Farley's remarks. Tesla, which closed 11 percent higher on Tuesday, ended Wednesday down more than 2 percent. \u2014 CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

Wall Street expected the company to earn $2.05 per share for 2018.
